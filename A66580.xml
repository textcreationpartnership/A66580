         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt thing that I am to requeſt of thee (good
Reader) is, to reade this Preface, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou adress thyſelf to peruſe
the Booke: And then not to reade, irregularly, beginning, with the end, or at
the middle, or with what ſhall be offered by meere chance; but to take the
following Introduction, and Chapters, as they come in order; that ſo the
former, may be a preparation to the latter, and the latter may receyue light,
and ſtrength from the former. For, the matters being connected of
themſelves, will growe to be either vnintelligible, or obſcure, or
confuſed; if their right Conſequences, and orderly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queles, be
neglected, or inverted, and will certainly come by that meanes, to be
perverted, and miſtaken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I cannot doubt, but that an Anſwer to Mr:
Chillingworths Booke, hath bene expected, long ſince. But they who are
acquainted, with the many, and long, and great, and inſuperable obſtacles
of voyages to remote countreyes; long, frequent, and great ſickneſſes;
and vnavoidable imployments (impoſed by Authority, which I ought not to
reſiſt, though ſome can witness, that even in that, I ſtrayned
obedience, more than I ſhould haue adventured to doe vpon any other
occaſion) which haue croſſed my earneſt, and conſtant deſires, will
not ſo much marvell, that this Work hath bene long in doeing, as that
fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally it is donne. This one thing is evident: That not any difficulty, to
anſwer, could haue bene cauſe of ſo long, delay: ſince whoſoever can
anſwer now, could haue donne it much ſooner, if extrinſecall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
had bene removed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for that vnfortunate man, whom I confute, Truth
obliges me to declare, that, beſide his moſt contemning, diſdaining,
proud, bitter, and even bloudy, waie of anſwering, by ſeeking to make
odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, both the Religion, and perſons of Catholiques (as will appeare by
what I note in due place) I muſt inſiſt vpon this; that in reality his 
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59214:3"/>Book is no Confutation of Charity Maintayned, who anſwered
Dr: Potter according to the grounds of Proteſtants, not of Socinians, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other new Sect. And therefore Mr: Chillingworth, flying to new Principles, hath
abandoned Dr: Potter, and all the elder kind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and left his
Adverſary in poſſeſſion, of being vnanſwered; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably to his
ingenuous acknowledgment, when time was, that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Maintayned, could not be
defeated by any forces of Proteſtants, and that he had a way to confute him. 
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">See, the Iudgment of an vniverſity-man
(Pag: 68, Sect: 16.)</note> Miſerable Proteſtancy! That could find no
Advocate, except an Enemy to it and all Chriſtianity, who tooke this
occaſion, only to vent new Hereſies, no less repugnant to Proteſtants,
than to Catholiques. Did not Proteſtants foretell, and in f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct prophecie, their owne ruine,
in preferring this vnhappy man, before all England, to be Defender of their
Faith? Who can wonder, to behold that Nation ſwimming in deſolation, and
bloud, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures to behold a Book publiſhed, approved, applauded, which
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely, and directly teaches, Chriſtian Faith not to be infallibly
true, and conſequently, that whatſoever Chriſtians haue hitherto
believed, of Scripture, of Chriſt, of all Chriſtian verityes, may (for
ought they can certainly know to the contrary) proue fabulous, falſe, or no
better than dreames. If he who omitted to enact any Law, or decree any
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for Paricides, gaue the reaſon thereof, by asking, whether
there could poſſibly be any ſuch Crime: Much more Charity Maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned had
no reaſon to fetch from Hell, this Antichriſtian doctrine, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
imagining, that any Chriſtian would profess to maintayne ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a
Tenet, the contrary whereof even Dr: Potter delivers, not as a thing
diſputable, or which needed any proofe, but as a firſt Principle, to be
ſuppoſed among Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Preſently vpon the publication of Mr: Chillingworths
Book, he was by diverſe printed Treatiſes; charged with this, and other
vnchriſtian Doctrines, and expreſly conjured to cleare himſelfe, vnder
paine of being eſteemed guilty, if he were ſilent; as by the <hi>Church
Conquerant over humane wit: The totall ſumme; The judgment of an
v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity-man; Chriſtianity Maintayned;</hi> but never could be induced,
to anſwer for himſelf, in any one particular; which ſilence, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this nature, could procede only from guiltiness, as he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
forwarned, in the Direction to N. N. (Chap: 3.)</p>
            <p n="5">5. If any vndertake a Confutation of my Book, he will doe
himſelf manifeſt wrong, vnless he doe me ſo much right, as not to pretend
an <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59214:3"/>Anſwer to mee, if he abandon Mr: Chillingworth, and
forſake his grounds, and ſo oppoſe me by new Principles, as Mr:
Chillingworth injuriouſly delt with Charity Maintayned. Or if he will
profess, not to defend the particular Tenets, or debates of Mr: Chillingworth;
I muſt exact of him, that by declaring ſo much, the world may know, that
Mr: Chillingworth hath bene confuted; whom, whoſoever forſakes, he cannot
be judged to anſwer my Book, but to commence, a new ſuite, or begin a new
Work, of which I ſhall not eſteame myſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to take any notice.
For, as Charity Maintayned confuted Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, not Socinians; ſo I
confute Mr: Chillingworths Book, and not the Principles of other Men, or Sects,
diſagreeing from him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is alſo deſired, that he follow not Mr:
Chillingworth, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to draw his Adverſary, to handle particular
Points, nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to our preſent generall Controverſy: That he
cite the places of thoſe Authors, whoſe Authorityes he alledges, which Mr:
Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth frequently omitts to doe: That he propoſe my Arguments
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fraude, diſguiſe, or diſadvantage; as I haue bene ſo very
carefull, and even ſcrupulous, to relate with all ſincerity Mr:
Chillingworths Opinions, Reaſons, and Words, that not ſeldome I had
recourſe to the Errata, noted in the end of his Book, holding it an vnjuſt
thing, to charge him, with any over ſight of the Print; though hee hath not
delt ſo fairely with Charity Maintayned, whom he impugnes, even in things
placed among the Errata of the Printer, and corrected.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I profess with all ſincerity, and ſeriouſness, that
I haue not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly omitted to anſwer any one Point in my Adverſaries
whole Book, either particularly, and explicitely, or els in Principles, which
involue an Anſwer to all particulars when they ſhall be propoſed. I am
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to repeete the ſame things, either to anſwer my
Adverſarie in his repetitions, or for the connection of the matters, which
require it; or becauſe it is to be feared, that not every Reader will
remember, or know, how to apply what is paſt. I am not ignorant, that in
anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Mr: Chillingworth, I confute an Academy of Socinians, to whom he
owes the matter, and ſubſtance of his Book, though it appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his
name only. But Truth is Truth, and will be ſuch, in deſpight of Hereſie,
Sophiſtrie, and witt. One favour I muſt acknowledg to receyue from Mr:
Chillingworth (though I owe him no thanks for it) that his Contradictions are
ſo frequent, as they alone are enough to confute himſelf: Whereof I giue no
examples heere, in regard, they <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59214:4"/>perpetually offer
themſelves, through his whole Book, as the Reader will perceyue, and, if I be
not deceived, not without wonder that a man ſo cryed vp by ſome other,
ſhould ſo patently be decryed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not vpon any ſenſe of
humility, but by the fate (as I may ſaie) of falſhood, which cannot be long
conſtant to itſelf.

               </note> And this muſt needs appeare
credible, if we conſider, that thoſe Books, which were firſt publiſhed
againſt him, agree in the ſame judgment of his Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, though I am
verie certaine, they could not borrow their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, from one an other.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As for the bulk of my Book; I muſt acknowledg, that it
might haue bene compriſed in a leſſer compass, if I could in wiſdom
haue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the conceypts of men, by the matter, which certainly did
often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not require, or deſerue any Anſwer. But we are debters
ſapienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; inſipientibus, to all ſorts of perſons, and many
will be apt to Judge, and proclaime, all that to be vnanſwerable, which is
not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally anſwered to their hand. Nevertheless, vpon exact account,
though Mr: Chillingworth anſwer one Parte only of Charity Maintayned, yet you
ſee it is no ſmall volume, but is more than three times greater than the
Part anſwered. And ſo one half of Charity Maintayned temaines till this day
vnanſwered.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I meddle not with Mr: Chillingworths Anſwer, by waie of
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, to a litle Work, intituled, <hi>A Direction to N. N.;</hi> becauſe
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vpon the publiſhing of his Book, that Preface of his, was in
ſuch manner confuted, by a wittie, erudite, and ſolid Book, with this
Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>(The judgment of an Vniverſity-man concerning Mr: William
Chillingworth his late Pamphlet, in Anſwer to Charity Maintayned)</hi> that
He was much troubled thereat, but yet thought fit to diſgeſt his vexation
by ſilence.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But the maine Point, which I muſt propoſe heere,
and which I confide, everie indifferent Reader, will finde to be clearely
evinced, even out of Mr: Chillingworths owne words, is this: That whereas he
gives this Title to his Book <hi>(The Religion of Proteſtants a ſafe way to
ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> he might (and ought) in ſtead thereof either to haue
ſaied, <hi>(The Religion of Proteſtants not a ſafe way to
ſalvation)</hi> Or, <hi>(The Religion of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholiques a ſafe way to
ſalvation)</hi> Or finally, <hi>(Chriſtian Religion not a ſafe way to
ſalvation.)</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="11">11. Firſt; He confeſſes that ſome Proteſtants
muſt be in errours, <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59214:4"/>and proves it, becauſe they hold
Propoſitions contradictorie one to an other; and beſides, he teaches, that
millions of them erre damnably; in theſe words, (Pag: 21.) <hi>If any
Proteſtant or Papiſt be betraied into, or kept in any Errour, by any
ſinne of his will (as it is to be feared many millions are) ſuch Errour is,
as the cauſe of it, ſinfull and damnable: Yet not excluſiue of all hope
of ſalvation, but perdonable, if diſcovered, vpon a particular explicite
repentance; if not diſcovered, vpon a generall and implicite repentance for
all ſinnes known and vnknowne.</hi> To which words if we add what he ſaieth
(Pag: 16. N. 21.) <hi>The very ſaying they were pardonable, implies they
nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded pardon, and therefore in themſelves were damnable;</hi> The
Concluſion will be; that the errours of Proteſtants are damnable in
themſelves: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they needed no pardon or repentance, nor could it be
a ſinne to <hi>he betrayed into, or kept in them.</hi> And (Pag: 19. and 20.)
he ſaieth; <hi>If they faile to vſe ſuch a meaſure of induſtry in
finding truth, as humane prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſcretion ſhall adviſe
them vnto, in a matter of ſuch conſequence, then their errors, begin to be
malignant, and juſtly imputable, as offences aganſt God, and that loue of
his truth which he requires in vs.</hi> And he in the ſame place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
affirmes, that <hi>the farre greater parte of Proteſtants are in this

Proteſtants, for the errours which they hold; and yet makes no ſcruple to
delude them, with a verball Mock-Title, that the <hi>Religion of Proteſtants
is a ſafe way to ſalvation.</hi> But this is not all. He ſaieth (Pag:
218. N. 49.) <hi>I would not be ſo miſtaken, as if I thought the errours
even of ſome Proteſtants vnconſiderable things, and matters of no moment.
For the truth is, I am very fearefull, that ſome of their opioions, either as
they are, or as they are apt to be miſtaken, (though not of themſelves ſo
damnable, but that good and holy men, may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with them, yet) are too
frequent occaſions of our remiſnes, and ſlackneſſe, in running the
race of Chriſtian Perfection, of our deferring Repentance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to God, of our frequent relapſes into ſinne, and not ſeldome of
ſecurity in ſinning, and conſequently, though not certaine cauſes, yet
too frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Religion be <hi>a ſafe way to ſalvation,</hi> which, not accidentally, but
even by the Doctrine thereof, gives ſo frequent occaſions of <hi>me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</hi> And (Pag:
387. N. 4.) he grants, that Charity Maintayned hath <hi>Something that has
ſome probability to perſwade ſome Proteſtants to forſake ſome of
their opinions, or other to leaue their Communion.</hi> From which words it
neceſſarily followes, that all Proteſtants are in ſtate of ſinne, and
damnation, either becauſe they themſelves hold errours, or by 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59214:5"/>reaſon, they <hi>leaue not the Communion</hi> of thoſe
who hold them. And (P. 280. N. 95.) he ſaith to vs <hi>Though Proteſtants
haue ſome Errors, yet they are not ſo great as yours;</hi> which laſt,
though it were true (as it is moſt falſe) yet it is impertinent; yea it
makes againſt Proteſtants, by granting, that theyr errors are damnable
(though not ſo damnable as ours) and conſequently, that their Religion
cannot be <hi>a ſafe way to ſalvation.</hi> And it is to be obſerved,
that he writes the ſaied words, (that <hi>Proteſtants baue ſome
Errors</hi>) in conformity to what Dr: Potter confeſſes (Pag: 69.) that
errors and corruptions, are <hi>not perfectly taken away</hi> among
Proteſtants, <hi>nor every where alike.</hi> And what a ſafe way can that
Sect be, which by the Profeſſors, and Defenders thereof is confeſſed to
be guilty of Errors againſt Faith, and damnable in themſelves? He ſpeaks
alſo fully to my purpoſe, when he ſaieth (Pag: 306. N. 106.) <hi>For our
continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Communion</hi> (he ſpeaks of Proteſtants)
<hi>notwithſtanding their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, the juſtification hereof, is not ſo
much, that their errours are not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: As that they require not the belief
and profeſsion of theſe errors, among the conditions of their
Communion:</hi> Which excuſe of his, doth not exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, but aggravate the
ſinne of Proteſtants, who do not only erre, but alſo communicate with
others who erre, from which Communion, we haue heard him confess, that Charity
Maintayned hath ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability to diſſwade men. In the eyes of vulgar
people, this mixture of different Sects, vnder one name of Proteſtancy, may
ſeeme a kind of good thing, as bearing a ſhew of Charity, yet indeed, to
wiſe men, ſuch communicants muſt appeare, to be as litle zealous,
conſtant, and firme in their owne Religion, as they affect to be eſteemed
charitable to others. And to every ſuch Proteſtant doe fully agree thoſe
excellent words of glorious S. Auſtine (de Civit: Dei Lib: 21. Cap: 17.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">He doth erre ſo much the more
abſurdly, and againſt the word of God more perverſly,</q> by how much he

            <p n="12">12. Neither in this Diſcourſe, doe we relie vpon his
wordsonly, but on his Tenets, and Grounds, and ſuch Truths, as both hee often
delivers, and muſt be granted by all Chriſtians; namely, that it is
damnable, to deny any leaſt Truth ſufficiently propounded, to a man, as
revealed by God; and therefore ſeing Proteſtants diſagree about ſuch
Truths, ſome of them muſt of neceſſity erre damnably. And ſo, he
ought to alter the Title of his Book, into the direct contradictorie, and
ſaie, <hi>The Religion of Proteſtants not a ſafe way to ſalvation.</hi>
For, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59214:5"/>ex integra cauſa, malum ex quocunque defectu;
and as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not affirme, that Action to be vertuous, which failes in any one

damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, he muſt giue this Title to his Booke, Proteſtancy not a

            <p n="13">13. Or if he be reſolved, not to chang his Title; vpon
this Ground, That albeit Proteſtants erre damnably, yet they may be ſaved,
becauſe they erre not in Fundamentall Articles, abſolutely, and
indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably, neceſſary to conſtitute one a member of the Church,
and in that regard, may be either excuſed by Ignorance, or pardoned by
Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Then,</p>
            <p n="14">14. I proue my ſecond Propoſition; That, for the verie
ſame reaſon he muſt ſay, and might haue put for the Title of his Book:
<hi>The Religion of Roman Catholiques a ſafe waie to ſalvation:</hi>
ſeing he expresly and purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teaches through his whole Book, that we
erre not in fundamentall points, and that we may be ſaved by ignorance, or
Repentance. That our Errors be not Fundamentall, he declares in plaine termes.
For Ch: Ma: in his preface to the Reader (N. 13.) having ſaied: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Since he will be forced to grant that
there can be aſſigned no viſible true Church of Chriſt, diſtinct from
the Church of Rome, and ſuch Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as agreed with her, when Luther
firſt appeared, whether it doe not follow, that ſhe hath not erred
fundamentally; becauſe everie ſuch errour deſtroyes the nature and being
of the Church, and ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhould haue had no viſible Church on
earth?</q> To which demand Mr. Chillingworth anſwers in theſe words: (Pag:
16. N. 20.) <hi>I ſay in our ſenſe of the word Fundamentall, it does
follow. For if it be true, that there was then no Church distinct from the
Roman, then it must be, either becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe there was no Church at all, which we
deny. Or becauſe the Roman Church was the whole Church, which we alſo deny:
Or becauſe ſhe was a part of the Whole, which we grant. And if ſhe were a
true part of the Church, then ſhe retained tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Truths which were
ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation, and held no errours which were
inevitably and vnpardonably deſtructiue of it. For this is preciſely
neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to conſtiture any man or any Church a member of the Church
Catholique. In our ſence therefore of the word Fundamentall, I hope ſhe
erred not Fundamental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but in your ſenſe of the word, I feare ſhe did.
That is, ſhe held ſomething to be Divine Revelation, which was not;
ſomething not to be, which was.</hi> Behold how he frees vs from all
Fundamentall errors, though he feares we are guilty of errours, which he calls
damnable, that is, repugnant to ſome Divine Revelation, whereas he
profeſſes as a thing evident <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59214:6"/>that ſome Proteſtants
muſt erre fundamentally in that ſenſe, becauſe they hold
Contradictories, of which both partes cannot be true. And ſo even this for
conſideration, he muſt ſay: The Religion of Roman Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques a ſafer
way to ſalvation, than Proteſtancy: ſeing he can not proue that we erre,
by Reaſon of any contradiction among ourſelves in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, as it
is manifeſt that one Proteſtant is contrarie to an other; eſpecially if
we reflect, that not onlie, one particular or ſingle perſon contradicts an
other, but whole Sects are at variance, and contrariety, as Lutherans,
Calviniſts, Anabaptiſts, new Arians, Socinians &amp;c: The firſt point
then it is cleare he confeſſes; I meane, that our ſuppoſed errours are
not Fundamentall; which is ſo true, that whereas in ſeverall occaſions he
writes, or rather declaimes againſt vs, for denying the cup, to laymen, and
officiating in an vnknown toung, as being, in his opinion, points directly
contrarie to evident Revelation, yet (Pag: 137. N. 21.) he hopes that the
deniall of them ſhall not be <hi>laid to our charge, no otherwiſe then as
building hay and ſtubble on the foundations, not overthrowing the foundation
itſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. But for the ſecond; doth he hold that we may be
excuſed by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or ſaved by Repentance, as he ſaieth Proteſtants
may? Heare what he ſpeakes to Catholiques (Pag: 34. N. 5.) <hi>I can very
hardly perſwade myſelf ſo much as in my moſt ſecret conſideration
to deveſt you of theſe ſo needfull qualifications of ignorancce and
Repentance. But whenſoever your errors come into my minde, my only comfort is
amideſt theſe agori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,
that the Doctrine and practiſe too of Repantance, is yet remaining in your
Church.</hi> And this hee teaches, through all his Book, together with Dr.
Potter; and they vniverſally affirme, that thoſe Catholiques may be
ſaved, who in ſimplicity of hart believe what they profess; as they may be
ſure En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Catholiques doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who might be begged for fooles, or
ſent to Bedlam if they did not belieue that Faith, and Religion, be be true,
for the truth whereof, they haue indured ſo long, and grievous perſecution.
Beſides it being evident, that many learned Proteſtants in the chiefeſt
points controverted betwene them and vs, agree with vs, againſt their
pretended Brethren as is ſpecified, and proved hereafter, and is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
by evidence of fact) the Religion of Proteſtants cannot be ſafe, or free
from damnable Opinions, vnless our Religion be alſo ſuch. For I hope they
will not ſay, that the ſelfe ſame Aſſertions, taken in the ſame
ſenſe, are true in the mouth of Proteſtants, and falſe in ours. We
muſt therefore conclude, that if he will make good his title; <hi>The
Religion, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants a ſafe way to ſalvation,</hi> he muſt ſay the
ſame of vs Catholiques, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59214:6"/>he acknowledges not to erre in fundamentall
points, and to be capable of inculpable Ignorance, or Repentance, for which
ſelfſame reſpects he pretends <hi>The Religion of Proteſtants to be a
ſafe way to ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. But what if Mr. Chilling worth deveſt Proteſtants
<hi>of that ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full qualification by ignorance,</hi> which he denies not
to vs? I will faithfully relate his words, and leaue others to judge what a
champion Proteſtants haue choſen. Ch: Ma: (part. 1. Cap 5. N. 32.) objects
to Proteſtants, that their departure from the Roman Church vpon pretence of
errour could not be excuſed, ſeing by leaving her they could not hope, to
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide the like vnfundamentall, nor be ſecured from Fundamentall, errors. To
this, Mr. Chillingworth (Pag: 290. N. 87.) anſwers; that Proteſtants are
ſo farre from acknowledging, that they haue no hope to avoide errors of the
like nature and quality with ours (which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to be
vnfundamentall) <hi>that they proclaime to all the world, that it is moſt
eaſy and proue to ſo, to doe all thoſe that feare God a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d love the Truth,
and hardly poſsible for them to doe otherwiſe, without ſupine negligence,
and extreame impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> I will not inſiſt here how ſtrange, and even
ridiculous, it is, in him, to ſay, that <hi>it is most prone and eaſy</hi>
for Proteſtants not to fall into errors, at leaſt not Fundamentall, yea
that it is <hi>hardly poſsible for them</hi> not to avoide ſuch errours;
ſeing they diſagree ſo irreconciliably among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and diverſe
of them fall into thoſe (pretended) errours, which we maintaine againſt
Proteſtants; all which one would think, could not happen, if it were
<hi>moſt prone and eaſy</hi> for Proteſtants to avoide ſuch errours,
<hi>and hardly poſsible for them to doe otherwiſe</hi> (that is, not to
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide them) <hi>without ſupine negligence and extreame impiety.</hi> But
that which I ſaie now, is; That ſeing de facto he confeſſes
Proteſtants to hold errours (yea, millions, even the greater parte of them,
to be in error by their owne fault, as we haue ſeene aboue) it followes, that
in his judgment, they are actually guilty of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>upine negligence, and extreame impiety,</hi>
which vices, certainly cannot ſtand with invincible, or probable ignorance;
and ſo all erring Proteſtants are excluded from Mr. Chillingworths
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, or Sanctuary of ignorance.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Nay, what if he hold the errours of Proteſtants to be
vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable? Sure I am, he ſaieth (Pag: 275. N. 58.) <hi>God is infinitely
juſt, tod the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore as it

                  </gap>, or
obstinacy, or negligence would not.</hi> Now, we haue heard him avouch, that it
is eaſy for Proteſtants to come to the knowledg of the Truth; and hardly
poſſible for them to doe otherwiſe without <hi>ſupine negligence and
extreame impiety,</hi> and therefore <hi>it is <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59214:7"/>to be feared,
God will not pardon them,</hi> even in the opinion of Mr. Chil: their
ſelected Advocate, though for ends of his owne, he thought fit, to publiſh
his Book vnder this Title; <hi>the Religion of Proteſtants a ſafe way to
ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. I ſaied in the third place; That vnless he confess
the Religion of Roman Catholiques to be <hi>a ſafe way to ſalvation,</hi>
he muſt not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, The Religion of Proteſtants not to be a ſafe
way, but alſo; that, <hi>Christian Religion is not a ſafe way to
ſalvation.</hi> And the Reaſon is cleare, out of what hath bene ſaied
already. For ſeing he holds it not neceſſary, that any Church be free
from errours vnfundamentall, and that the whole Church, before Luther was
infected with ſuch errours, and that at this day Proteſtants erre damnably,
I wonder of what Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church, he can ſay with Reaſon; it is <hi>a
ſafe way to ſalvation,</hi> if he deny it to the Roman Church, which he
confeſſes not to erre fundamentally? And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore if any Chriſtian
Church be a ſafe way, we are ſafe even in the Principles of Chil: and
Potter. And what greater ſecurity can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, than when all ſides,
both friends, and Adverſaries confess our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to be ſaved,
whereas we cannot, with truth, giue any ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe to Proteſtants without

            <p>The Anſwer to this demand cannot be ſo fitly and fully

clearly (againſt his fundamentall and capitall hereſie) that Chriſtian
Faith muſt be infallible, and exempt from all poſſibility of errour, or

of man, and rely on the ſtrength of reaſon, to trye, and ſo perhaps to
check, and reject the ſpirit of God, though knowne, and acknowledged, to be
his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? We reade in holy Scripture (Deuter: c. 18.21.22.) <hi>If in

muſt be ſupernaturall and require Gods particular Grace, which excludes all
falshood. Jf Faith, Hope, and Charity be Gifts infuſed by God, not acquired
by Acts procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from our naturall forces, and for that reaſon we can not

not to be increas'd or diminiſhd, loſt, conſerved, or acquired, or

who haue once withdrawne their beleife and obedience from Gods Church, and an
jnfallible living judge in matters belonging to Faith, do runne into extremes.
Some of them, to maintayne the neceſſity of Grace, denie freewill: others
in direct oppoſition to theſe, giue all to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and denie the
neceſſity of Grace. Some reject inherent Juſtice though infuſed by God;
yea they teach that the guilt of ſinne ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, doth ſtayne all
our actions, which therfore are in themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves deadlie ſinnes. Some grant
inherent Juſtice or ſanctity, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by God, but acquired by the
naturall forces of mans Freewill. But Catholiques hold the meane; and
acknowledg true inherent Juſtice and ſanctitie, <hi>infuſed</hi> by the

of piety proceeding from our will, aſſiſted by grace, or from grace with

from our will; and yet ſupernaturall, pious, and meritorious, becauſe they

reject it, but to lay open the falshood of the frequent calumnies, which

ſaith. 
<q rend="margQuotes">If any ſhall ſay that man can be
juſtifyed before God by his owne workes, which can be wrought eyther by the

<hi>Cap.</hi> 5. The ſacred councell declares, that the beginninge of
juſtification in men who are come the the vſe of reaſon, is to be taken
from the prevenient grace of God by Chriſt Ieſus, that is, from his
calling, by which they are called without any merits of their owne, that they
who by ſinne were averted from God, by his exciting and helping grace may be
diſpoſed to convert themſelues to their juſtification, by freely
aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59214:10"/>and cooperating with the ſame grace, ſo
that God touching the hart of man by the illumination of the Holy Ghoſt,
neyther man himſelfe doth nothing at all, receiuinge that inſpiration,
ſince it is in his power to reject it; neyther yet can he with his owne
freewill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue him ſelfe to juſtice in the ſight of God without his
Grace. And therfore when the Holy Scripture ſaith: Convert to me, and I will
convert to you: we are put in minde of our freewill. When we anſwer: Conuert
vs ô Lord tothee, and we ſhall be conuerted, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our

diſpoſed to juſtice it ſelfe, while by beinge excited and help'd by
Diuine grace, conceavinge faith by hearinge, they are freely moued to God,
beleeuinge thoſe things to be true which are reuealed and promiſed by God;
and particularly this, that God iuſtifyes a ſinner by his grace, by the
redemption which is in Chriſt Ieſus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap</hi> 7. Although none can be iuſt except he to whom the
merits of 
<q rend="margQuotes">our Lord Ieſus Chriſt are
communicated, yet in this juſtification of a ſinner, that is done while by
the merit of the ſame moſt ſacred Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the charity of God by the
Holy Ghoſt is diffuſed, and is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the harts of thoſe who are
iuſtifyed. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. Neyther is our juſtice maintayned as of our
ſelues, neither is the juſtice of God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnknowne, or reiected: for
that which is ſayd to be our juſtice, becauſe we are juſtifyed by it
inherent in vs, the ſelfe ſame is the juſtice of God, becauſe by him it
is infuſed into vs by the merits of Chriſt. Neither is it to be omitted,
that although in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo great reckoninge be made of good workes,
that Chriſt hath promiſed that he ſhall not be deprived of his reward who
ſhall giue to one of his little ones a cuppe of cold water. And the Apoſtle
witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that our tribulation which preſently is momentary and light,
worketh aboue meaſure exceedingly an eternall weight of glory in vs: yet far
be it from a chriſtian man to confide or glory in himſelfe and not in our

thoſe to be their merits, which are his owne gifts. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. We are
juſtifyed gratis, becauſe nothing which goes before juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether it be faith or workes, doth merit the grace of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for if

commanding admonisheth, both to do what thou canſt, and to aske, what thou
canſt not, and helps thee, that thou mayſt be able to doe it. Whoſe
commandements are not heauy; whoſe yoke is ſweet, and burden light. For
they who are the ſonnes of God, loue Chriſt; and they who loue him, as he
witneſſeth, doe keepe his words: which ſurely they may doe with the help
of God.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 
<q rend="margQuotes">Men ought to feare, knowing that they are
regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to the hope of glory, and not yet to glory it ſelfe, from the
combat which remaynes with the flesh, world, and diuell: wherin they cannot be
victorious, vnleſſe with the grace of God they obey the Apoſtle,
ſaying, we are debters, not to the fleſh, to liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the flesh.
<hi>Chap.</hi> 16. Chriſt Jeſus dayly giues vertue to the juſtifyed, as
the head to the members, and the vine to the vine-bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: which vertue doth
always goe before, accompany, and follow their good works, and without which
they could not in any wiſe be gratefull to God, and meritorious. Laſtly,
the councell defines: If any ſhall say, that a man juſtifyed, either can
without the eſpeciall helpe of God perſeuer in the juſtice he hath
receiued, or that with it he cannot: be he accurſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. More might be alledged out of the Councell, but this may
ſuffice to demonſtrate the Doctrine of Catholiques concerning the
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of God's Grace, to belieue; Hope; Loue God; Keepe his
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; Merit; Repent; Ouercome temptations; and perſeuer to the end.
All which is not inconſiſtent with, free-will which is aſſiſted, and
elevated, not hindered or impeached by grace; as it is wont to be ſayd. Grace
doth not deſtroy, but perfit nature. Our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaryes grant that Adam in
the ſtate of innocency was indued with freewill, and yet grace was then
neceſſary for the exerciſe of every ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Act, with which
humane nature can haue no ſufficient proportion, (otherwiſe ſupernaturall
were not ſupernaturall, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall or due to nature) and therfore it is
cleare that the neceſſity and concurrence of God's grace agrees very well
with mans freewill. Thus all difficultyes are clear'd, and Holy Scripture
declared not to imply any contradiction, while it teaches both the freedome of
our will, and the neceſſity of Grace.</p>

<q rend="margQuotes">Agreable to this, is the ſaying of

clearly proue that juſt men are ſuch by a gift inherent, and not due to
nature, but ſupernaturall: we might add conuincing Reaſons, grounded in
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of faith, if it were my purpoſe to treat this matter at large.
But I will content my ſelfe with one, taken from the many Texts of holy
Scripture which we haue alledged (and many more might be brought) in this
manner: God concurres to certaine Actions, (v. g. Belieuing hoping &amp;c.)
with a particular influence aboue the naturall exigence of humane nature;
therfore ſuch Actions are both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall:
Good,</hi> becauſe it were impiety to ſay that God doth, or can, by
ſpeciall motion, produce an ill, and ſinfull Action:
<hi>Supernaturall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no naturall cauſe alone can produce them,
nor hath any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall exigence that they be produced by ſome more high and
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull cauſe: as, though our ſoule cannot be produced by any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Cauſe or Agent, yet there is an exigence in nature that it be created by God,
when ſufficient diſpoſitions are preexiſtent in the Body. Now it being
once granted, that there are <hi>good</hi> and <hi>ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>
Actions, it followes that there muſt be in our ſoule ſome
ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall powers, or facultyes, as connaturall Principles, or Cauſes
of ſuch Actions: therfor ſuch Powers muſt be gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, as in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
are <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> and abſolutely <hi>good,</hi> without any
tincture or ſtaine, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ſinfulness. Which ſequeles are
ſo cleare, that proteſtants <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59214:24"/>not deny them, but grant at
leaſt the ſupernaturall Habits of the three <hi>Theologicall</hi> Vertues,
Faith, Hope, and Charity, which is ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe
(though I know not any generall ground or doctrine of theirs for which they
doe, or muſt, deny the ſupernaturall infuſed Habits of <hi>Morall</hi>
Vertues) but they denie, that either by theſe, or any other quality, or Gift
we are <hi>juſt</hi> in ſuch manner, as that we do not ſtill remayne
ſtayned with habituall deadly ſinne: which hereſy is clearly confuted by
the Elogiums of the Fathers, and Texts of Scripture, alledged in this, and the
former Sections.</p>
               <p n="45">XLV. For if deadly ſinne ſtill remaine, how doth
Grace take away the ruſt of ſinne, make the ſoule reſplendent; whiten

derived from Chriſt; the firſt ſtole; the riches of the diuine

               <p n="46">XLVI. How ſhall holy Scripture be verifyed in ſaying;
that, <hi>as by the diſobedience of one man, many were made ſinners, ſo

that <hi>if in the offence of one, Death raigned by one,</hi> much more they

Death alſo remaines, with which. Life cannot raigne. How can the holy Ghoſt
be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs while we perſiſt in ſinne? How can he abide in God, and God
in him, in whom ſinne and ſatan abides? How can Faith worke by charity in
him who is voluntarily poſſesd by deadly ſinne; than which nothing is
more repugnant to charity, whoſe inſeparable effect is, effectually to
deteſt all mortall ſinne; how is he a new creature, who is in ſtate of
ſinne, which alone makes one a child of Adam or the old man, not of Chriſt;
How doth he cleaue to God, and is one ſpirit with him, who cleaueth to

gaine only this <hi>Concluſion,</hi> that his Faith in Chriſt, of
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all the myſteryes contained therin, may proue fabulous and
falſe. And yet I confeſſe it to be a thing very certaine and euident,
that the deniall of jnfallibility in Gods Church, for deciding controuerſyes
of Faith, muſt ineuitably caſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Vpon this deſperate, vnchriſtian,
and Antichriſtian doctrine: and while <hi>Proteſtants</hi> mayntaine the
Church to be fallible, they cannot auoide this ſequele, that theire doctrine
may be falſe; ſince without jnfallibility in the Church, they cannot be
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely certaine, that Scripture is the word of God. O what a ſcandall
doe theſe men caſt on Chriſtian Religion, by either directly
acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, or laying grounds from which they muſt yeild Chriſtian
Faith not to be jnfallibly true; while Iewes, Turks, Paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and all who
profeſſe any religion, hold their belief to bee jnfallible, and may
juſtly vpbraide vs, that euen Chriſtians confess themſelues not to be
certaine that they are in the right, and haue, with approbation of greateſt
men in a famous <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59214:27"/>Uniuerſity, publiſhed to the world
ſuch their ſenſe and belief! In the meane tyme, in this occaſion, as in
diuerſe others, I cannot but obſerve, that Heretiques alwayes walke in
extreams. This man teacheth Chriſtian Faith in generall, and the very grounds
therof not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly certaine. Others affirme, Faith to be certaine
euen as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to particular perſons, whom they hold to be
juſtifyed by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute certaine beliefe, that they are juſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But now let vs come to proue this truth: <hi>Chriſtian
Faith is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and infallibly true, and not ſubject to any leaſt
falshood.</hi> wherin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I maintayne the cauſe of all Chriſtians,
and of all men, and mankind, who by the very inſtinct of nature, conceiue the
true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to ſignify a thing certaine, as proceeding from God, and vpon
which men may, and ought ſecurely to rely, without poſſibility of being
deceiued; and that for this reaſon the whole world ought to joyne with me
againſt a common adverſarie: yet even for this very reaſon, I knowe not
whether to eſteeme it a more diſſicile taske, or lamentable
neceſſity, that we are, in a matter of this moment and quality, to proue
Principles, or a Truth which ought to be no less certaine, then any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that can be brought to prove it; as hitherto all good Chriſtians haue
believed, nothing to be more certainly belieued by Chriſtian Faith, than that
it ſelfe is moſt certaine. Yet confiding in his Grace, whoſe
<hi>Gift</hi> we acknowledg Faith to be, I will endeauour to proue and defend
this moſt Chriſtian and fundamental truth, againſt the pride of humane
witt, and all preſumption vpon naturall forces.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our firſt reaſon may be taken from that which we haue
touched already of the joynt conceypt, vnanimous concent, and inbred ſenſe
of men, who conceyue Diuine Faith and Religion to imply a certainty of Truth:
and if they did once entertayne a contrary perſwaſion, they would ſooner
be carryed to embrace no religion at all, than weary their thoughtes in
election of one rather than another, being prepoſſeſſed, that the
beſt can bring with it no abſolute certainty. Thus by the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
agreement of men we proue that there is a God, and from thence conclude, that
the beliefe of a Deity proceeds from the light of nature; which alſo
aſſures vs that God hath a prouidence ouer all things, and cannot want
meanes to communicate himſelfe with reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by way of ſome

words. Authority alone is that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites ignorant perſons, that they
make haſt to wiſdome. Till we can of our ſelues vnderſtand the truth,
it is a miſerable thing to be decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Authority: yet more miſerable it
is not to be moued therwith. For if the Divine prouidence do not command humane
thinges, no care is to be taken of Religion. But if the beauty of all things,
which, without doubt, we are to belieue to flow from ſome fountayne of moſt
true pulcritude, by a certaine internall feeling doth publikly and priuatly
exhort all beſt ſoules to ſeeke and ſerue God: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſpaire,
that by the ſame God there is appointed ſome Authority, on which we
relying,</q> as vpon an infallible ſtepp, may be eleuated to God. Behold a

            <p n="4">4. <hi>M. Chillingworth</hi> profeſſes to receiue
Scripture from the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Tradition of all Churches, (though yet there
is ſcarcely any booke of Scripture, which hath not beene queſtioned or
rejected by ſome) much more therfore ought all Chriſtian to belieue,
Chriſtian Faith to be jnfallible, as beinge the moſt vniverſall judgment
and <hi>Tradition</hi> of all Chriſtians, for their Chriſtians beliefe, and
of all <hi>men</hi> for their ſeuerall Profeſſions in poynt of Religion.
And as men ought not to be remooued from belieuing that there is a God, though
to our weake vndeſtandings, there be preſented Arguments touching his
Nature, Freedom of will, Prouidence, Preuiſion, and the like, of farr greater
difficulty to be anſwered, than can be objected againſt the jnfallibility
of Faith; ſo, ought we not to deny the jnfallible Truth of Chriſtian Faith,
notwithſtanding thoſe poore objections, which this man and his
Aſſociates with equall impiety and boldness make againſt it. And therfore
both in the beliefe of a God, and certainty of Faith, Religion, and worſhip
of him, we are to follow the certaine inſtinct of Nature, and conduct of
Piety, not the vncertainty of our weake vnderſtanding, or liberty of

Church propounds, is diuine Reuelation made in the Scripture. Nothing less than
this, nothing but this, can erect or qualify an act of ſupernaturall Faith
which muſt be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely vndoubted and certaine; and without this, Faith
is but opinion, or at the moſt, an acquired humane belief.</hi> And (Pag.

<hi>Chillingworth</hi> will ſay it doth by an aſſent highly probable) but
that it muſt be <hi>abſolutely diuine,</hi> which he
contradiſtinguiſhes from humane Faith, making this, not that, abſolutely
certaine And indeed to litle purpoſe ſhould <hi>Potter,</hi> and all other
Diuines require an <hi>Objest and Motiue jnfallibly true,</hi> if likewiſe
our aſſent to it be not jnfallible. What auayles it, that Diuine Authority

            <p n="6">6. But nothing can be imagined more effectuall and express

ſaith; <hi>That there is required of vs a knowledg of the Articles of our

I ſaie, can be more cleare againſt this pernitious doctrine of
<hi>Chillingworth,</hi> than theſe words of <hi>Potter</hi> Pag. 199.
<hi>Though the aſſent of Faith be more certaine (if it be posſible) than
that of ſenſe, or ſcience, or demonſtration; becauſe it reſts on

fallibility of faith is oppoſd by all Proteſtants; and particularly they
who teach that we know the Scripture to be the word of God, by the ſpirit or
inſtinct of the Holy Ghoſt, hold Faith to be infallibly true. Thus
<hi>Caluin (Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>jnſtit: C.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.] ſaith:
<hi>Petenda eſt haec perſuaſio ab arcano ſpiritus teſtimonio: This
belief</hi> (that Scripture is the word of God) <hi>is taken from a ſecret
teſtimony of the ſpirit.</hi> And afterwards; <hi>Teſtimonium ſpiritus
omni ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione praeſtantius eſſe reſpondeo;</hi> I <hi>answer that the
teſtimony of the ſpirit is to be preferrd before all reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. And here is to be obſerued, that
<hi>Chillingworth,</hi> diſagreeing from Proteſtants in this maine,
generall, tranſcendentall point, differs from them for euery particular, in
an eſſentiall attribute or perfection of Faith; ſeing an aſſent
<hi>only probable,</hi> is eſſentially diſtinguiſhed from an aſſent
abſolutely and infallibly <hi>certaine;</hi> and ſo he oppoſes them in a
higher degree, then if he did contradict them in one, or more chiefeſt
particular Articles of faith; or rather he cuts of at one blowe all the true
belief of Chriſtians, by making it not certaine; wherby men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no
Chriſtians, as not belieuing in Chriſt with diuine certaine faith. His
tenet [<hi>Pag.</hi> 367. <hi>N:</hi> 49.] that he who disbelieues one
Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, may yet belieue an other with true diuine faith, is in no wiſe to
be approoud but this his doctrine, that Faith is fallible, is farr worſe, as
disbelieuing all, and poſitiuely denying that certainty which is
eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to <hi>diuine Faith,</hi> and diſtinguiſheth it from
<hi>Opinyon,</hi> or <hi>humane</hi> beliefe.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This fundamentall truth, that faith is abſolutely
certaine, is very clearly deliuered in Holy Scripture. <hi>S. Paule</hi>
ſaith, [<hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.1.] 
<q rend="margQuotes">Faith is the ſubſtance of things to

            <p>But yet let vs more and more proue this truth, and turne the
vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our Aduerſaryes agaynſt themſelues, by demonſtrating that
Chriſtian Faith muſt raiſe vs aboue the Arguments of Credibility; vvhich
I doe in this manner.</p>
            <p n="14">14. If Faith exceede not the aſſent vvhich we giue to
the probable motiues of Credibility, there could be no captiuating of our
vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nor Obedience or Freedom of will in belieuing the Articles of
Faith. But we are to captiuate our vnderſtanding, and exerciſe free
obedience of our will in belieuing the Articles of Faith; Therfor Faith muſt
raiſe vs aboue the Arguments of Credibility. The maior is cleare. For where
there is euidence and neceſſity to aſſent, there is no place for
captiuating or ſubmitting our vnderſtanding, or free and voluntary
obedience of our will, which <hi>Chilling:</hi> confeſſes (Pag. 329. N. 7.)
wher ſpeaking of obedience in Faith, he ſaith: <hi>which can hardly haue
place where there is no posſibility of diſobedience, as there is not where
the vtderſtanding does all, and the will nothing.</hi> Neither can it auaile
him to ſay, as he ſayth in the ſame place, that the Faith of
Proteſtants im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an act of obedience, becauſe <hi>it is not pretended
to haue the abſolute euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſence or demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtration.</hi> For this is
nothing to the purpoſe, as long as he belieues the Articles of Faith, with no
higher tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a probable aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, proportionable to probable Arguments,
and riſes not to a certainty of ſenſe, demonſtration, or any other,
aboue theſe probable Motiues; becauſe his fallible, and only probable faith
hath the certanty and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of demonſtration for ſuch a degree of
probability; it being no more certaine and euident, that a Concluſion drawen
from neceſſary Premiſes, is neceſſary; than that a Concluſion
rightly deduced from probable Premiſes, is probable; which is all he requires
for an aſſent of faith, as he expreſſly affirmes (Pag. 36. N. 8.)
ſaying: <hi>God deſires only that we belieue the Concluſion as much as
the Premiſes deſerue;</hi> and (N. 9.) <hi>God requires of all, that their
faith should be proportionable to the motiues enforcing to it;</hi> mark
<hi>enforcing,</hi> and Pag. 112. N 154. <hi>Neither God doth, nor man may
require of vs as our duty</hi> (obſerue what obedience and duty he requires)
<hi>to giue a greater aſſent to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion than the Premiſes
deſerue.</hi> And finally, this is his maine ground to proue, that
Chriſtian Faith is not infallible, but only probable, that is, ſuch only as
he holds the Premiſes and Arguments of Credibility <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59214:33"/>to be:
wherby it is euident that in his way there is left no place for captiuating our
vnderſtanding, by a voluntary free ſubmiſſion, and obedience to
Chriſt and his doctrine.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Which yet to be neceſſary (as I aſſumed in my
Minor propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) cannot be denyed by any who belieues Holy Scripture; as
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares (2. Cor. 10.5.) B
<q rend="margQuotes">ringing into captiuity all
vnderſtanding vnto the obedience of Chriſt. (Rom. 1.5.) By whom (Ieſus

<q rend="margQuotes">And the ſelfeſame thing doe you

            </p>
            <p n="16">16. Morouer, that Faith doth not neceſſitate our
vnderſtanding, but is free and voluntary euen <hi>quoad
ſpecificationem,</hi> as Diuines ſpeake, that is, in ſuch manner, as it
is in our will to belieue the contrary of what we belieue by Faith, and for
that cauſe requires Gods particular aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and a pious affection
in the will, and a ſubmitting, or captiuating of our vnderſtanding, is
gathered out of diuine Scriptures, that vpon the ſame preaching of the

17.32.34.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Certaine mocked, but certaine ſayd; we

<q rend="margQuotes">it is ſayd that God prepared for the

[Luc. 2.] Bleſſed art thou who haſt belieued.</q> But a meritorious act,

faith is ſuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitates the vnderſtanding to aſſent, (at

Therfor his Faith is not that <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59214:33"/>Chriſtian belief, which
Holy Scripture commands, that is, a free Aſſent, captiuating our
vnderſtanding, and rayſing it aboue all the Motiues of Credibility or
Probability, and conſequently, abſolutly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and infallible; wherby
we voluntarily ſubmit, and perfectly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our ſoule to God, and his
ſupreme authority. For wheras we may diſtinguiſh foure ſorts of
Knowledg; wherof the Firſt is Experimentall or of ſenſes. 2.
Scientificall. 3. Humane Faith. 4. Diuine Faith; Man ought to be ſubject to
God by a voluntary knowledg, and ſuch the firſt and ſecond ſort is not.
The third is imperfect, as the authority on which it relyes, is ſubject to
errour. The fourth then remaynes, as it were Religion, or higheſt worſhip,
called <hi>latria,</hi> or the greateſt ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherby the will
perfectly ſubject vnto God, ſubjecteth vnto him the other powers, which are
ſubordinate vnto it ſelfe; and it is great impiety to belieue, that God
hath not enabled Chriſtians, to offer to theyr creatour, and Redeemer, a
ſeruice or Obedience, connaturall to the Diuine Autority, Perfection, and
Teſtimony.</p>
            <p n="17">17. This reaſon drawen from Obedience, exerciſed in the
act of Chriſtian Faith, is further enforced thus. The command of the will, or
Pious affection which Diuines require in Faith, produceth in the
vnderſtanding a more firme aſſent, than would be produced without 
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vide Card: Lugo de Fide Diſp. 10.
Sect. 2. N. 19.</note> it, as we ſee by experience, that men obſtinate in
errour, or ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly affected to ſome truth, produce by theyr will a more
firme aſſent than otherwise it would haue bene: yea the command of the
will, affection, paſſion, and the like, moue men to aſſent to that,
vnto which otherwiſe they would not aſſent, or from which perhaps they
would diſſent. Therfor ſeing the will can moue the vnderſtanding to
produce the ſubſtance of an act, much more may it determine vs to produce
more degrees of aſſent, or diſſent, than otherwiſe it would. Although
therfor it were granted, that a Concluſion formally as ſuch, can haue no
greater ſtrength than it receyues from the Premiſes, yet the ſame
concluſion, or object taken materially, may receyue greater ſtrength, from
ſome other cauſe, than it did receyue from the Premiſes, as ſuch; as
the ſame materiall truth, which, being inferred from probable Premiſes, is
only probable, may grow to be certaine, if it be deduced from demonſtratiue
arguments. Therfore <hi>Chillingworths</hi> 
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59214:34"/>ground, that
the Aſſent of Faith, being a Concluſion drawne from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Premiſes,
can be noe more than probable; is either falſe; if it be vnderſtood, that
by no other meanes it can be made more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; or impertinent, if he
meane, that it cannot exceede probability, preciſely and formally as it is a
Concluſion inferd from probable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; it being ſufficient for our
purpoſe, that it be improued to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty by ſome other meanes. Yea
ſince he grants that our Aſſent of Faith receyues from the Arguments of
Credibility the higheſt degree of probability, and that indeed it receyues a
further perfection from the Pious Affection, and prudent command of the will,
we muſt conclude, that it is raiſed aboue the higheſt degree, of a
probable to a certaine Aſſent: Which yet is more and more euinced by this
following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p n="18">18. It is impoſſible that Chriſtian Faith can retaine
the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of probability (as <hi>Chilling.</hi> pretends) if it
haue no greater perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than it receyues from the ſole probable
Arguments of Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Therfor we muſt find ſome other ground on which,
Chriſtian Faith relyes, than meerly ſuch arguments. The antecedent I proue
thus: For (to omit what ſome perhaps will ſay, that at leaſt the
Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Faith, which he ſayth is a Concluſion, is not ſo probable
as the Premiſes on which it depends, and ſo is not probable in the
higheſt degree) although it were granted, that the Motiues of Credibility,
conſidered alone, may mooue the vnderſtanding to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of
probability, and ſuch as one cannot entertayne without a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent doubt of
the contrary; yet if they be compard and confronted with very great
difficultyes objected againſt them, by reaſon that the Myſteryes of
Chriſtian Faith, which really are ſuperiour, and ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are contrary
to naturall Reaſon, and Philoſophy; that ſuppoſed higheſt pitch of
probability muſt needs be abated, and leſſened, and come to ſome lower
than the higheſt. As althongh the will do neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily loue an object
which appeares good, when it attends not to any reaſon or formality of ſome
euill, neuertheleſſe it is not neceſſarily carryed to loue that object,
when it perceyueth any euill therin; ſo the vnderſtanding, ſo long as
truth is propoſd without any thing offered to the contrary, neceſſarily,
or eaſily yelds aſſent; but if contrary dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultyes be repreſented,
it is apt to pauſe, and conſider, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps doubt, or feare, and muſt
needs fall ſomwhat from its former confidence, adheſion, and aſſent, if
it be left to it ſelfe, and not aſſiſted <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59214:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>with greater ſtrength, than can ariſe from meere probabilityes,
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred, and balanced with contrary ſeeming ſtrong reaſons. And as
<hi>Chilling.</hi> ſpeaking to Catholiques, ſayth (Pag. 113. N. 154.) <hi>I
hope you will giue vs leaue to conſider whether the motiues to your Church be
not impeached, and oppoſed with compulſiues and enforcements from it:</hi>
ſo others will ſay of the Motiues to Chriſtian Religion; that they are
<hi>impeached with contrary compulſiues from it,</hi> beſides the
ſublimity of the Miſteryes themſelues aboue humane Reaſon, which is apt
to doubt of whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it doth not ynderſtand; as we feare not only bad,
but alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne pathes, and as to our eye the cleareſt skye, if it be
almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our kenning, ſeemes to be a kind of darkness. Thus then the
probability of <hi>Chillingworths</hi> faith, being brought downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
higheſt pretended degree of probability, becomes compatible with good, and
great probability of the contrary ſide; (as heate and cold, if neither of
them be in the moſt intenſe degree, may ſtand togeather) and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the vnderſtanding may conceyue not only a poſſibility,
but a probability alſo, and a feare that the Chriſtian Religion is falſe.
For auoiding which wicked ſequele, there is no other remedy, except to
acknowledg Faith to be an Aſſent certaine and infallible, aboue all
probability of humane Motiues, or arguments of Credibility.</p>
            <p n="19">19. And in this occaſion we may obſerue, that the
examples vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally alleadged to proue, that we can no more doubt of the
Concluſion drawne from the Arguments of Credibility, than a man doubts
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch an one be his father, and the like; doe not vrge, but rather
may be retorted. For in ſuch caſes, it is ſuppoſed, that there are many
good reaſons for one ſide, for example, that ſuch a man is father to
ſuch a child &amp;c. and none to the contrary. But it happeneth otherwiſe
in our caſe: there being many and hards objections obuious to humane
reaſon, againſt the Myſteryes of Faith, which may diminiſh that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of aſſent, which otherwiſe might be grounded vpon the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of
Credibility, if they were conſidered alone; as one could not belieue ſuch a
man to be his father, if he had ſome very probable proofes for the contrary,
with the ſame firme perſwaſion, as he would doe, in caſe no ſuch
proofes did offer themſelues: and ſo, as I ſayd, this and the like
Arguments and examples, may be retorted againiſt thoſe who bring them: and
ſtill we muſt conclude, that we cannot belieue Chriſtian Religion as we
ought, without an abſolute, certaine, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d jnfallible Aſſent; which will
more appeare by the Reaſon following.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59214:35"/>
            <p n="20">20. Theſe very Motiues of Credibility manuduce and ſend
vs vp to an Authority, which is able to transfuſe greater perfection to our
Aſſent, than they themſelues can giue. Becauſe they tell vs of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to be belieued for Diuine Reuelation, and ſo proclaime themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to be
only Diſpoſitions and Preparations, which being ſuppoſed, God affords
his particular Grace for producing an Act proportionable to his Diuine
Teſtimony, as, with ſome proportion, by hearing or reading ſpirituall
things, the ſpecies are excited, and God by that occaſion giues
inſpiration for Faith, Hope, Charity &amp;c. aboue the naturall power of the
externall words; and as Experimentall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg by ſenſe, is a
Diſpoſition to Scientificall knowledg, which yet takes not its nature,
eſſence, and perfection from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p n="21">21. From hence it followes, that men are obliged to belieue
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, not in what manner ſoeuer, but as a Doctrine deliuered
and reuealed by God, and therfor to be embraced aboue all; that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all
contrary objects or objections, and not to be altered vpon any occaſion,
ſuppoſition, or authority of men or Angels, as S. Paule tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vs by an
impoſſible ſuppoſition, to express the matter home. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat 1.8. 
<q rend="margQuotes">Although we, or an Angel from Heauen
euangelize to you, beſide that which we haue euangelized to you, be he
anathema.</q> This admonition or denuntiation of S. Paule, muſt needs
ſuppoſe Chriſtian Faith to be aboue all probability. For it is euidently
againſt reaſon, to joyne togeather theſe two judgments, or
Aſſertions: This doctrine is only probable, and grounded only in probable
and credible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet; That it is reaſonable, or neceſſary,
òr euen poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to aſſent to it in ſuch manner, as neuer to
belieue the contrary, though reaſons, ſeeming, vpon the beſt examination
a man can make, better than the former, ſhould offer themſelues againſt
it; ſeing it is certaine that he cannot be certaine, that better reaſons
cannot poſſibly be offered. For if he be certaine that better reaſons for
the contrary are not poſſible; his aſſent is not probable, but
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Therfor ſince we are not to forſake Chriſtian Religion for
whatſoeuer poſſible motiue, or Reaſon, or Authority of Men, or Angels,
we muſt giue it abſolute certainty, and not only proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
            <p n="22">22. And becauſe this kind of Argument, is of greater
moment than perhaps appeares at firſt ſight, I will dilate it by ſaying
further; that <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59214:35"/>according to his Aſſertion about the
probability of faith, no Chriſtian, yea no man can be ſetled in any
Religion; ſince he muſt be ready to chang whenſoeuer better reaſons
ſhalbe preſented againſt it; neither can he be certaine that he may not
ſooner, or later fynd ſome ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For, a faith only probable is
a perpetuall Temptation to it ſelfe; and we may truly ſay, <hi>Accedens
tentator dicit,</hi> in the preſent Tenſe, ſeing Probability doth not
exclude ſome feare that the contrary may be true. Nay euery conſideration
about Faith, to ſuch men as <hi>Chill.,</hi> who loue to be eſteemed
conſidering and diſcourſing men, is more than a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; it is a
yeelding, or conſent againſt Faith, inuoluing this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Perhaps that
which I belieue, is falſe, and the contrary true.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Yea this vaſt abſurdity doth not only flow from
this doctrine, but it is in effect acknowledged by him in express words [Pag.
380. N. 72.] Where he deeply taxes all Catholiques, becauſe they <hi>eyther
out of idleness refuſe the trouble of a ſcuere tryall of their Religion, or
out of ſuperſtition feare the euent of ſuch a triall, that they may be
ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and ſtaggered, and diſquieted by it; and therfor for the
moſt part doe it not at all; or if they doe it, they doe it without
indifference, without liberty of judgment, without a reſolution to leaue it
if it proue apparentily falſe. My owne experience aſſures me, that in
this imputation I doe you [Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques] no injury: but it is very apparent to
all men from your ranking doubting of any part of your Doctrine among mortall
ſinnes. For from hence it followes, that ſeing euery man muſt reſolue
he will neuer commit mortall ſinne, that he muſt neuer examine the grounds
of it at all, for ſtare he should be moued to doubt: or if he doe, he muſt
reſolue that no motiues, be they neuer ſo ſtrong, shall moue him to
doubt, but that with his will and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution he will vphold himſelfe in
affirme belief of your religion.</hi> Doth not it appeare by theſe words,
that he muſt haue no ſuch reſolution as he reprehends in vs, but muſt
be ready to doubt, or to leaue his, and all Chriſtian Religion? [And Pag.
326. N. 4.] he endeauours to proue, that Faith cannot be abſolutely certaine,
becauſe if it were ſo, any leaſt doubting would deſtroy it; which
ſhewes, that doubting may well conſiſt with his kind of probable faith;
which is that very abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity which we inferrd, as impious againſt true
Religion, of which we muſt reſolue neuer to doubt, though <hi>per
jmposſible</hi> an Apoſtle, or Angel ſhould moue vs therto, (as we haue
heard out of S. Paule) and yet the Authority of an Apoſtle, or perſwaſion
of an Angell ſhould in all reaſon be preferrd before Faith, if it be only
probable.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59214:36"/>
            <p n="24">24. This inconſtancy in Religion appeares further by what
he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes of himſelfe (Pag. 389. N. 7.) where ſpeaking of a command
of obedience to the Roman Church, he hath theſe words: <hi>ſure I am, for
my part, that I haue done my true endeauour to find it true, and am ſtill
willing to doe ſo, but the more I ſeeke, the further I am from findinge
&amp;c.</hi> Behold, how after ſo long tyme, ſo much deliberation, ſo
many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Religion, euen after the writing of his Booke, he is ſtill
willing to find and embrace a Religion different and contrary to that which he
profeſſed. Alſo (P. 184. N. 90.) he ſayth: <hi>Shew vs any way, and do
not ſay but proue it to haue come frrm Chriſt and his Apoſtles down to
vs, and we are ready to followit. Neither do we expect Demonſtration herof,
but ſuch reaſons as may make this more probable than the contrary.</hi>
Agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this is his profeſſing, (Preface N. 2.) that he had a
<hi>trauellers indifferency, moſt apt and moſt willing to be led by
reaſon to any way, or from it.</hi> And (N. 5.) he profeſſes, that his
conſtancy in Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted <hi>in following that way to Heauen
which for the preſent ſeemed to him the moſt probable.</hi> A poore
comfort and miſerable faith, only probable, and of no longer continuance than
for the tyme preſent! I willingly omitt, that his deeds were agreeable to his
words, changing, firſt from Proteſtants to Catholike, then from Catholike
to Proteſtant, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout againe to Catholike, till at laſt he became
neyther Preciſian, nor Subſcriber to the (39. Articles,) nor confeſſed
Socinian, nor any thing vnless that mhich S. Bernard ſayth of Abailardus,
(Ep: 193.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Homo ſibi diſſimilis eſt, totus
ambiguus.</q> He is a man who diſagrees euen from himſelfe, wholy
compounded of doubts. 
<q rend="margQuotes">I willingly leaue out his middle words,
Intus Herodes, for is Ioannes; inwatdly a Herode out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly a Iohn.</q> If the
Apoſtles be to be belieued only in that which they deliuered conſtantly as
a certaine diuine truth, as he teaches (Pag. 144. N. 31.) ſurely this man,
and his fellow Socinians, ought not to be belieued in any thing, ſeing
according to their doctrine that faith is fallible, and but probable, they
neither are, nor can be conſtant in any poynt they deliuer: and ſo we
cannot ſay ſo much of them as of the Scribes and Phariſees (Matt: 23.2.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">whatſoeuer they ſhall ſay vnto you,
doe, but according to their works, doe not: but, doe neither what they ſhall
ſay, nor according to their works.</q> And heere I beſeech, and euen begg
of the Reader, if he haue any care to ſaue his ſoule, that he will
conſider how far the faith of this man, and his Aſſociates, is from true
Chriſtian Faith, of which we haue heard S. Paule ſaying: 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59214:36"/>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Although we, or an Angell from Heauen
euangelize to you beſide that which we haue euangelized, be he an
Anathema.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="25">25. But this is not all that ſtrongly offers it ſelfe
in this poynt. For, not only his Faith cannot affoard any reſt or
ſatisfaction, wherby a man may ceaſe from further inquiry, but leaues him
with a ſtrict obligation to be inceſſantly examining his Religion, and
ſeeking whether he can fynd ſome more probable, and better grounded. This
ſequele ſeems cleare. Becauſe the true Faith and Religion being
abſolutely neceſſary to ſaluation, charity towards ones ſelf obliges
euery man, to ſeeke the ſafer way, and the moſt certaine Religion. And
ſeeing he is not certaine, that the Religion, or <hi>way to Heauen which for
the preſent ſeemes to him moſt probable</hi> (as we haue heard him
ſpeake) is indeed the right way; what remaynes, but that men are obliged to
be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally buſied, and perplexed in the ſearch of the true Faith
neceſſary to ſaluation? This my inference ſeemes to be acknowledged by
him. For beſide what hath beene already cited, he ſayes of himſelfe, P.
278. N. 61.] <hi>If I did not put away idleness, and prejudice, and worldly
affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo examine to the bottome all my opinions of diuine matters,
being prepard in mynd to fellow God, and God only, which way ſceuer he shall
lead me; if I did not hope, that I eyther doe, or endeauour to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e theſe things, certainly I
should haue little hope of obtaining ſaluation.</hi> Loe heere little hope of
ſaluation, vnless a man be ſtill <hi>examining to the bottome his opinions,
and be prepard in mynd to follow, &amp;c.</hi> But in Vaine it is to ſeeke
that reſt, which will neuer be found, except in a Faith, and Religion,

liberty of life? Seing his belief of Heauen and Hell, is but an opinion
concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things of an other world; wheras worldly pleaſures are in

wherwith all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hitherto haue belieued their Faith to abound, hath
not bene able to ſtop the courſe of mens licentiouſness; what can we now
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but that they who before did runne, will now fly after the Idols of
whatſoeuer may appeare to their ſoules or bodyes, objects of profit, or
delight? (Pag. 326. N. 4.) he teaches, that, if faith be infallible, no
Chriſtian could <hi>committ any deliberate ſinne,</hi> yea and muſt be
<hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Charity;</hi> becauſe <hi>Faith is the victorie which

let vs now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to ſome other kind of Argument.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Hitherto Chriſtians haue belieued, that true
Chriſtian <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>Theologicall vertue,</hi> that is, it hath
for its Formall object and Motiue God, as he is infinitly Wiſe, and True; as
<hi>Hope</hi> reſpects Him, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly Powerfull; and <hi>Charity,</hi> as
infinitly Good. But the Faith of theſe men cannot be a <hi>Theologicall</hi>
vertue: Therfore their faith is no true Chriſtian Faith. The <hi>Minor</hi>
cannot be denyed in the grounds of this man. For, although they will pretend to
belieue the Articles of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Religion, becauſe God hath reuealed them;
yet the <hi>Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</hi> of Credibility, or <hi>humane teſtimonyes</hi> are
the only <hi>formall object</hi> or <hi>Motiue</hi> of this Aſſent, God
hath reuealed the Myſteryes of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They are, I ſay,
Premiſes from which the ſayed Concluſion or act and aſſent of Faith
is deduced, and according to which it is to be meaſured, and not only
Preparations or Diſpoſitions to it, (as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Diuines teach) ſo that
the infallible Diuine Reuelation comes to be only a <hi>materiall object,</hi>
belieued for another fallible <hi>Motiue,</hi> or <hi>Formall Object,</hi>
infinitly beneath the Teſtimony of God, which alone is able to conſtitute a
<hi>Theologicall</hi> vertue. Thus he plainly ſaith (Pag: 36. N. 8.) <hi>God
deſires only that we belieue the Concluſion as much as the Premiſes
deſerue, that the ſtrength of our faith be equall or proportionable to the
credibility of the Motiues to it.</hi> and moſt expresly he ſaith in the
ſame place: <hi>Our faith is an aſſent to this Concluſion, that the
Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of Chriſtianity is true, which being deduced from a Theſis, which
is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſically <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59214:38"/>certaine, and from an Hypotheſis,
wherof we can haue but a morall certainty, we cannot posſibly by naturall
meanes be more certaine of it then of the weaker of the Premiſes.</hi> You
ſee he holds the Aſſent of Faith to be a <hi>Concluſion,</hi> not
proportioned to Diuine Reuelation, which is moſt infallible and ſtrong, but
meaſured by the <hi>weaker</hi> of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, grounded vpon humane
inducements, which cannot giue <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> or nature and eſſence to a
<hi>Theologicall</hi> vertue: and ſo his probable Faith, is no more than an
<hi>humane Opinion.</hi> For, euen as he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth out of Mathematicall
Principles knowne only probably, hath not knowledg but opinion; ſo he that
belieues out of Principles not certaine, a Reuelation of its nature certaine,
hath not certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but only opinion. And therfor his ſaying (Pag:
35. N. 7.) that <hi>he conveyues Faith to be an aſſent to Diuine
Reuelations vpon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Renealer,</hi> will in no wiſe free him
from the juſt imputation of turning Diuine Faith into Opinion; ſince his
aſſent to Diuine Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is grounded, and meaſured, and receyues its
eſſence, from teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonyes and Principles only probable and humane, and
not from the Diuine Reuelation, without which, euen <hi>Dr. Potter</hi> (Pag.
143.) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſayes: <hi>Faith is but Opinion, or perſwaſion, or at
the moſt, an acquired humane belief.</hi> And it is to be obſerued, that
the Doctour ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akes expresly of the Authority of the Church, which he
ſayth can beget only an Opinion, and yet <hi>Chillingworth</hi> reſolues
our belief of the Scripture into the Tradition and teaching of the Church, and

Good Chriſtians can correct naturall Reaſon, in poynts which to
Philoſophers ſeemed euident truths and Principles, as in the Creation,
againſt that Axiom (Ex nihilo nihil fit, of nothing nothing is made) In the

back to the former Being;) In the incarnation, againſt (A ſubſtance is

Principles therof. And this, <hi>Chilling:</hi> muſt either grant, and ſo
yield faith to be infallible; or els muſt be content to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg a plaine
contradiction to himſelfe. This appeares by theſe words, [Pag. 376. N. 56.]
<hi>Propoſe me any thing out of this booke,</hi> (the Bible) <hi>and require
whether I belieue it or no, and ſeeme it neuer ſo incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

Booke (§ <hi>And wheras</hi>) he profeſſeth that he will not belieue
any thing contrary to <hi>any Verity reuealed in the Word of God, though neuer
ſo improhable or incomprehenſible to Naturall Reaſon.</hi> For if his
Faith be, to his vnderſtanding, only probable, how can he in prudence prefer
it before the contrary therof, which to his vnderſtanding ſeemes euident,
and certaine? Or how can an aſſent, which I judge to be <hi>only
probable,</hi> enable me to belieue that which I judg to be euidently
improbable? And it is in vayne for him to tell vs of the certainty of Gods
Reuelation, ſince we do not compare <hi>Naturall</hi> Reaſon with Gods
Reuelation, but with thoſe Motiues, for which we belieue the diuine
Reuelation; which being to him only probable, and eſteemed ſuch, and no
more, muſt yeald to appearance of certainty of the contrary: and therfor he
muſt either confess that he contradicts him ſelfe, or yield that Faith is
infallible a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more certaine tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> naturall reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p n="30">30. To ſpeake truth, if we conſider well, this
<hi>Socinian</hi> Faith, can haue no other vſe or effect, except only to
damne men by contenting themſelues with a faith of probability, when they
may, and ought to attaine a certainty. He himſelfe, [Pag. 36. N. 9.] doubts
not but that <hi>the ſpirit of God being implored by deuout and humble
prayer, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience, may and will by degrees aduance his
ſeruants higher, and giue them a certainty of adherence, beyond theyr
certainty of euidence.</hi> And <hi>thoſe that belieue and liue according to
their faith, he giues by degree the ſpirit of obſignation and confirmation,
which makes them know (though how, they know not) what, they did but belieue:
And to be as fully and reſolutely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the Goſpell of Chriſt,
as thoſe which heard it from Chriſt himſelfe with their eares, which

obſerue the lawes of charity, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which doing, you ſay, they
ſhall arriue to a full and reſolute aſſurance, euen aboue that which
you call faith? You ſay (Pag. 227. N. 61.) <hi>Gods asſiſtance is alwayes
ready to promote the Church farther; on condition she does implore it.</hi>
And, (Pag. 175. N. 75.) You grant the ſpirit of truth ſhall be giuen, and
will abide with thoſe <hi>that loue God and keepe his Commandements.</hi> Yea
ſince true Faith is alwayes the Gift of God, rayſing vs vp by Grace aboue
the ſtrength of nature: And that <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59214:40"/>euery one is obliged ro
haue true Chriſtian Faith, it is conſequent, that de facto all are bound to
beleiue with a Faith, produced by Grace, aboue the forces of nature, and
conſequently infallibly certaine. For heere that excellent ſaying of S. Leo
(Serm. 16. de Pass. Domini) hath place: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Iuſtè Deus inſtat praecepto,
quia praecurrit auxilio.</q> He may well exact of vs, an infallible Act of
Faith, ſeing he giues vs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Grace to performe what he exacts. And
(Pag. 34. N, 6.) you ſay, <hi>The eſſentiall character of Charity is to
judg and hope the best,</hi> by which you are obliged to judg and hope (vnless
the contrary be manifeſt) that euery one liues according to his belief, by
obſeruing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and ſo in fact is arriued to a certaine and
infallible Faith. Since therfore you grant, that the faith of thoſe who liue
according to their Belief, is not to be regulated by the Lawes of Logicke, and
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Syllogiſmes; with what ſhaddow of reaſon would you make men
belieue, that the Faith of all Chriſtians, neceſſary to ſaluation,
which is a ſpeciall infuſed Gift of God, muſt be ſubject to ſuch
Rules; as if it were a meere Concluſion, following only the weaker of the
Premiſes, and not meaſured by the ſpeciall Grace and Motion of the Holy
Ghoſt, aboue all Logick. Thus all your Objections againſt the infallible
Faith of Chriſtians, muſt be anſwered by your ſelf, as falſe and
ſophiſticall, and conſequently all Chriſtians may, and ought in
deſpight of ſuch paralogiſmes, to aſſert and belieue the
neceſſity of an infallible Faith. And, as I ſayd, the contrary doctrine
can ſerue only to delude, and damne thoſe vnhappy ſoules, who will be
harkninge to ſuch noueltyes; I ſay, to damne ſoules, euen though it were
falſely ſuppoſed, that his doctrine were true. For, all Chriſtians,
beſide this man and ſuch as hee, ſirmely belieuing, Chriſtian Faith
neceſſary to ſaluation to be infallibly true, and he acknowledging all
poynts of Chriſtian Faith to be but probable, (and ſurely he will not be
ſo ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as to ſay, he belieues this particular fancy, wherin he
diſagrees both from Catholiques and Proteſtants, to be more certaine than
all other Articles of Faith) it cannot be denyed, but that men are bound to
belieue with an infallible Aſſent; becauſe, as I ſayd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in matters abſolutely
neceſſary to ſaluation, we are bound by the Law of God, and Charity to
our ſelues, to embrace the ſafer way by meanes of an infallible Faith,
which he confeſſes may be obtained, by prayer, and obedience to Gods
commandements. And ſo vpon one account or other, all are obliged vnder payne

fooliſh ſinne, than the ſinne of Deſperation, irreuocably bringing
damnation, which might haue been auoided by Hope, for which Gods Grace is neuer

no more than probable.</p>
            <p n="32">32. For, Firſt I would for diſputation ſake, aske of
him, whether he meane, that the Concluſion doth ſo follow the weaker of the
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that it receyues no ſtrength or perfection from the fellowſhip
of a better Premiſe than it ſelfe is; If he anſwer, that it receyues no
ſtrength; then one will infer, that one Premiſe contayning the
Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or Reuelation of God, an other the teſtimony of men, could
produce no ſtronger concluſion, than if both Premiſes did containe only
the teſtimony of men; and ſo he muſt confess, that de facto he belieues
the Articles of Chriſtian Faith, no more than if by probable arguments, they
were proued to be teſtifyed by men alone. If he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, that rhe
ſtronger Premiſe, may eleuate the weaker, to produce a Concluſion
ſtronger than it ſelfe, he ſhould not haue ſpoken ſo raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if one
ſtrong and another weaker premiſe had no greater influe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into the
Concluſion, than if both the premiſes were weake.</p>
            <p n="33">33. But to omitt this; he ſhould haue declared, whether a

al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though preciſely and formally and <hi>Reduplicatiue</hi> as it is a
concluſion can beget only a probable aſſent, yet, I ſay, whether ſuch
a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion taken materially, and <hi>Specificatinè,</hi> may not be
ſufficient to bring our vnderſtanding to an infallible Act of Faith, not by
it ſelfe, but by applying the Diuine Reuelation, which growing by that meanes
and application, to be the immediate and formall Object of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59214:41"/>may moue it to an Aſſent proportionable to ſuch an
Object and Authority, that is, abſolutely certaine and infallible; as he who
applyes fire to a combuſtible ſubject, is occaſion that heat is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the fire immediately applyed, and not by him who applyed it; or as a
Preacher, or Paſtour, whoſe teſtimonyes are humane and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, when
they declare to their hearers, or ſubjects, that ſome Truth is
witneſſed by Gods word, are occaſion that thoſe people may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a

applyed by the ſayd meanes. This if he had declared, (as he ſhould haue
done not to deceaue his Reader) his mayne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the concluſion
followes the weaker premiſe, had bene anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, and confuted by
himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="34">34. And this ſame ground and conſideration, wholy
euacuates the examples which he alledgeth (pag. 36. N, 8.) That <hi>a man
cannot goe or ſtand</hi> ſtrongly, if either of his leggs be weake. That
<hi>a building can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſtable, if any one of the neceſſary pillars
therof be infirme and inſtable:</hi> That, <hi>if a meſſage be brought me
from a man of abſolute credit with me, but by a meſſenger that is not
ſo, my conſidence of the truth of the Reuelation, cannot but be rebated and
leſſened by my diffidence in the Relatour.</hi> For in our Caſe, humane
teſtimonyes are not the leggs on which Faith ſtands: nor the pillars which
vphold it; nor the meſſage or meſſenger for which we belieue; but it is
only the Diuine Reuelation on which the Act of Faith relyes, and from which it
receyueth perfection, nature, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and which alone is ſtrong
enough for that end.</p>
            <p n="35">35. If you object, that perhaps, that humane authority is
falſe, and propoſes to my vnderſtanding, Diuine Reuelation when God doth
not reueale; Therfor I cannot vpon humane teſtimony, repreſenting or
applying Diuine Reuelation, exerciſe an infallible Act of Faith. I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer:
it is one thing, whether by a reflex Act I am abſolutly certaine, that I
exerciſe an infallible act of Faith; and an other, whether indeed and in
<hi>actu exercito</hi> I produce ſuch an Act. Of the former I haue ſayd
nothing, neither makes it to our preſent purpoſe. Of the latter, I affirme
that when indeed humane teſtimony is true, and ſo, applyes a diuine
reuelation which really exiſts; in ſuch caſe, I may belieue by a true
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Aſſent of Chriſtian Faith. The reaſon of this ſeemes
cleare, becauſe although a truth which I know only by a probable aſſent,
is not certaine to me; yet in it ſelfe it is moſt immoueable and certaine,
in regard that while a thing is, it cannot but be for that tyme in which 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59214:41"/>it is, and ſo it implyes contradiction that, Diuine
reuelation should not exiſt, when by a true judgment I affirme it to exiſt;
which certaine exiſtance once ſuppoſed, it is able to tansfuſe
certainty and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to that Act of which it alone, and not any
precedent thing is the Formall Object and Motiue; Neither will God be wanting
to concurre on the belieuers part, with his ſpeciall Grace, neceſſary for
produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a ſupernaturall Act of Chriſtian Faith. And ſo his argument,
(ibidem) <hi>that a riuer will not riſe higher than the fountaine from whence
it flowes,</hi> turnes againſt himſelfe; and proues, that our Aſſent
flowing from Diuine and infallible cauſes, Will riſe as high, as thoſe
fountaines; to a ſupernaturall infallible Aſſent. This is ſufficient to
ſhew, how the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of a Concluſion taken ſpecificatiue doth not
hinder, but that by meanes therof, I may come afterward to an infalliblity in
my Aſſent deriued, not immediately from that Concluſion, but from the
Diuine Reuelation: Wherby his chiefeſt Ground is ouerthrowne, That it is
vniuerſally impoſſible, to exerciſe an infallible Act of Faith, vnless
the exiſtence of Diuine Reuelation, be certainly foreknowne in one of the
Premiſes.</p>
            <p n="36">36. But yet further; if we conſider all the other
Cauſes of Chriſtian Faith, they do euince that it is certaine and
infallible, as I haue touched before: For beſide the object of infinite
Authority on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuers part, God doth infuſe the Habit of Faith: He
giues a particular Actuall Motion of Grace for exerciſing the Act therof; He
effectually moues the will by a Pious aſſection and Command, to determine
the vnderſtanding to a firme aſſent of Faith, aboue the precedent
Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Credibility. If a better vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding conceiue the ſame
Object, with more perfection than another of leſſe capacity, what ſtint
can we put to that vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, which is directed and ſtrengthned by
rayes from the light <hi>quae illuminat omnem hominem? Which enlightneth euery

Faith, I add this <pb n="66" facs="tcp:59214:42"/>conſideration. If Faith require not
abſolute certainty, it were ſufficient to belieue, that the authority of
Scripture is only probable, or that it is on ly probable that God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither
deceyue, nor be deceued. For, this were ſufficient to ground a probable
aſſent, that Chriſtian Faith is true: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe according to his

Faith, is as it were the naturall ſenſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſince he who
ſo much impugnes it, cannot chuſe but make aſhew of defending it. (Pag.

belieue it vpon this Motiue, becauſe I conceyue it ſufficiently,

this Objection I haue anſwered at large, and turned it vpon himſelfe in

demonſtratiue refutation of this vaine fancy, prouing that Faith, euen true
and ſauing Faith, is not a thing conſiſting in ſuch an indiuiſible
point of perfection as you make it, but capable of augmentation and diminution:
Euery prayer to God to increaſe your Faith (or if you conceyue ſuch a
prayer derogatory from the perfection of your Faith) the Apoſtles praying to
Chriſt to increaſe their Faith, is a conuincing argument of the ſame
concluſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="44">44. Anſwer: Not to take notice of his improper ſpeach
of augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and diminution in Faith, which are appropriated to Quantity,
as intenſion and remiſſion are propertyes of Quality: the grouud and
ſuppoſition on which this whole objection goes, is manifeſtly vntrue,
namely, that we make Faith to be a thing conſiſting in an indiuiſible
point of perfection, wheras all Catholike Diuines teach that it hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of perfection and intenſion, no less then Hope, and Charity, and that de

juſtifying Grace. The Holy Councell of Trent (<hi>Seſſ.</hi> 6.

otherwiſe it were <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59214:43"/>not <hi>intenſion,</hi> but the

not the ſame truth knowne with more <hi>euidence</hi> (and conſequently

degrees of perfection, euen in certaine and infallible acts of our

infallible? And his objection, that according to vs, all true Faith muſt be
<hi>moſt certaine, and the moſt perfect that is, cannot be more than moſt
certaine,</hi> hath no more ſtrength than it receyues from ignorance. For,
when Faith is ſayd to be <hi>moſt certaine</hi> the compariſon goes not
betweene different degrees of graduall perfection in Faith it ſelfe, but
betweene Faith, and naturall knowledg: Or els Faith is ſayd to be <hi>moſt
certaine</hi> for its <hi>eſſence;</hi> becauſe with euery degree of true
Faith, we muſt belieue articles reuealed, with an aſſent <hi>ſuper

ſuch articles; as Hope relyes Vpon God <hi>ſuper omnia, aboue all,</hi> and

Charity eſſentially loues God aboue all things <hi>appretiatine,</hi>
chooſing to looſe all things, rather than to offend God, and therfor
effectually moueing vs not to conſent vnto any deadly ſinne. In theſe
eſſentiall perfections there is an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibility, and a <hi>moſt</hi>
or <hi>greateſt</hi> perfection, which being taken away, the Vertue is
deſtroyed; but it paſſeth not ſo in Graduall perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Faith,
Hope, Charity, and other Vertues, either infuſed, or acquired.</p>
            <p n="45">45. What knowledg is ſo certaine, euident, and perfect,
as the Beatificall Viſion? which may truly be called <hi>moſt perfect:</hi>
but how? In reſpect of other knowledg, terminated only to created Objects:
but in reſpect to it ſelfe, in order to Graduall perfection, it
conſiſts not in an indiuiſible poynt, becauſe one Angell, or Saint
beholds God <hi>intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuè,</hi> with more perfection, than another.
Thus euen <hi>your</hi> probable <pb n="70" facs="tcp:59214:44"/>Faith, muſt
<hi>eſſentially</hi> exclude all Doubt. Taken in the moſt proper
ſenſe, that is, not as it ſignifyes <hi>formidinem oppoſiti, ſome
feare leaſt the contrary be true;</hi> but as it is taken for a
<hi>ſuſpenſion of our aſſent</hi> to either ſide, which cannot
poſſibly conſiſt with a <hi>probable posſitiue aſſent</hi> to one
part; and in this eſſentiall notion of excluding all ſuch Doubt, all
probable judgments muſt agree, and yet you will not deny but there are
different Graduall degrees in probable aſſents, and in particular in your
probable Faith, which you proue to be but probable, that ſo you may, as you
pretend, agree with Scripture, mentioning different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Faith.</p>
            <p n="46">46. Not in this inſtance only, but in others alſo, I

which is directly for vs againſt your ſelfe. For, [Pag. 329. N. 7.] you

but that one <hi>might</hi> belieue with more certainty than an other Surely
you will be content that <hi>S. Paule</hi> enter into the number of thoſe who

<q rend="margQuotes">I am euen <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59214:44"/>now to be

and this you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to proue by ſome arguments which you ſtile
<hi>certaine,</hi> and then conclude <hi>from all theſe premiſes, this

degrees of certainty or perfection, both in different perſons at the ſame

encreaſe their Faith, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Domine adauge nobis Fidem.</q> [Luc.
17.5.] Lord, encreaſe faith in vs, makes nothing to the purpoſe, of prouing
any thing at all touching Faith neceſſary to ſaluation; becauſe that
prayer of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les did concerne <hi>fides miraculorum,</hi> the Faith of

compared with <hi>S. Matthew</hi> [C. 17. V. 19.] Where to the Diſciples
asking why they could not caſt out the diuell, our Saujour anſwered:
<hi>Propter incrednatatem Veſtram,</hi> By reaſon of your incredulity; and
yet it were impious to thinke, that the Apoſtles vnder ſuch a Maiſter,
were ignorant of Articles neceſſary to ſaluation in thoſe tymes, and
therfor their want was only of Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to work miracles: and
accordingly our Sauiour in both thoſe <hi>Euangeitſts</hi> tooke that
occaſion to ſpeake of the faith of miracles, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they would be able to
remooue mountaynes: Therfore this your proofe, taken from the prayers of the
Apoſtles for increaſe of their faith, is manifeſtly nothing to the
purpoſe: as neither is the Argument which you bring [Pag: 37. N. 9.] out of
thoſe words, <hi>Lord I belieue, helpe my vnbelief,</hi> which concernes only
faith of miracles, of deliuering that mans ſonne from a deafe and dumbe
diuell. [Marc: 9.23.] Woe be to Proteſtants if faith of working miracles, be

is made of a weake and little faith, he had proued, ſuch a weak faith to be
ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for Saluation; or that ſuch a faith, though ſtrong in it

teach, Faith to be <hi>obſcure</hi> compared with ſome more euident
naturall, or ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall knowledg, though it ſelfe be a great light,
according to that; 
<q rend="margQuotes">To a candel ſhining in a darke place

vertues is in it ſelfe very great and ſtrong, as I explicated aboue. I

which cannot be eſteemed a <hi>thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> but of ſome other
matter, as indeed he doth; namely, of a <hi>doubt</hi> amongſt Chriſtians
at that tyme, about eating certaine meates, once forbidden to the jewes, which
ſome made a ſcruple to doe, others not; and ſo <hi>weakness in faith</hi>
ſignifyes only a ſcruple, or tenderness of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for this
particular caſe; and therfor the Apoſtle in the next verſe mentions the
contrary perſwaſion of others: <hi>One belieueth that he may eate all
things,</hi> that is, is not troubled with ſcruple of conſcience in this
matter. What is this to our queſtion, about faith, and belief, of Articles
neceſſary to be belieued by all Chriſtians? Or how doth this proue, that,
Faith common to all Chriſtians, is ſufficient to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though it be
but probable, and not certaine? I beſeech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what you ſay. In
the matter of which the Apoſtle ſpeakes, the compariſon was not, betweene
a ſtrong and weake faith, or belief of the ſame thing, as our caſe goes,
but the queſtion was of contrary perſwaſions, one part judging that to be
lawfull, which the other held to be vnlawfull. And therfor if you will haue
your Objection rightly applyed, or not to be clearly impertinent, a man weake
in Faith muſt be he, who belieues Chriſtian Faith not to be true, nor the
practiſe of it lawfull: And doe you belieue ſuch a weake Faith to be
ſufficient to ſaluation? or that the Apoſtle will haue vs receyue them
who are <hi>weake in Faith</hi> in that ſenſe, that is, who belieue errours
contrary to Chriſtian Faith? Your paſſing from Faith <hi>neceſſary to

follow, that euery leaſt doubting in the rehearſed truthes (all which

euen according to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Socinians, there can be no actuall

            </p>
            <p n="53">53. But this is not all. It muſt follow by your argument,
that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doubt taken properly, though <hi>reſisted and involuntary,</hi>
is <hi>a damnable ſinne, abſolutely deſtructiue, ſo long as it
laſts,</hi> euen of the Probability of Chriſtian Faith, which being
deſtroyed, there remaynes no belief at all (either certaine, or probable) of
Chriſtian Religion. I ſayd, <hi>every doubt taken properly,</hi> which is,
when our vnderſtanding finding not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon to belieue one
ſide, more than another, can only doubt of both, without a poſitive
aſſent to either, as contrarily it happens in a probableact, which
aſſents determinatly to one part, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare that the
contrary is true. For, it is cleare, that ſuch a doubt which abſtracts from
a poſitiue aſſent to either part, is abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſſible with
a probable perſwaſion, which poſitiuely determines to one ſide, (it
being a manifeſt contradiction, for the ſame act to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from both
parts, and yet to determine vs to one) and ſo every ſuch Doubt, muſt be,
as you ſayd againſt vs, a Deadly ſinne. But why do I ſeeke after other
inſtances, than this moſt obvious and common to <pb n="76" facs="tcp:59214:47"/>all
Chriſtians, euen to Socinians? You pretend to belieue that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion is true, and conſequently cannot judg, at the ſame tyme, that it
is falſe: Therfor this judgment, Chriſtian Religion is falſe, <hi>though
reſiſted and involuntary, is a damnable ſinne, abſolutely
deſtructiue, ſo long as it laſts, of all faith</hi> where by you belieue
Chriſtian Religion to be true. And ſo in vaine you ſayd, no leaſt Doubt
could conſiſt with the contrary certainty, as if your objection did touch
only our infallibility of Faith, wheras it ouerthrowes euen your belief that
Chriſtian Faith is true. I do therfore end as I began, and ſay, you (yea
all Chriſtians) muſt anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer your objection.</p>
            <p n="54">54. Secondly; directly to your Objection of a doubt
reſiſted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary, and yet deſtructiue of infallible Faith,
becauſe any the leaſt Doubting ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not conſiſt with certainty: I
anſwer: If he who doubts, conceiue his doubt to be againſt that which he
belieues by Faith, and yet doth not reſiſt, ſuch a doubt is voluntary,
and deſtroyes true Faith, but makes nothing for your purpoſe, who ſpeake
of a doubt reſiſted, and not voluntary. If he reſiſt, then he rejects
the Doubt, and ſo doubts not, but retaines his former vndoubted aſſent,
with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a new victory againſt the temptation to doubt; and it is
non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, or <hi>implicatio in adjecto,</hi> to talke of doubting, and
reſiſting, at the ſame tyme. For if it be reſiſted, it is not
accepted, nor is it a doubtfull aſſent, or ſecunda operatio intellectus,
which affirmes or denyes by way of judgment, but is a meere apprehenſio, or
prima operatio of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, repreſenting to our mynd a doubt,
which by reſiſtance is ſtopt from paſſing to a judgment; as when
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſayd [Pſalm. 52.1.] <hi>The foolish man ſayd in his hart;
there is no God;</hi> theſe words, there is no God, affirmed by the fooliſh
man, were in reſpect of the Prophet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented only by way of
apprehenſion, and not of judgment, or affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that it was ſo: And
Ariſtotle teaches, that men may perhaps think they belieue express
contradictions, when indeed they only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them without any aſſent,
or belief. How eaſy then is it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, that a doubt offered, but
reſiſted, neither is, nor can be deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of infallible Faith,
ſeing the reſiſtance is cauſe that we do not doubt? But now, if we
ſuppoſe that ſuch a doubt is not perceyved to be repugnant to our Faith,
one may aſſent to it, becauſe one may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue contradictions, not
vnderſtood to be ſuch, as dayly experience teaches; but then that doubt is
not voluntary as it ſtands in oppoſition with Faith, (in regard that no
ſuch oppoſition is repreſended to our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59214:47"/>and ſo it is no way deſtructive of Faith.</p>
            <p n="55">55. I need not ſay any more for confutation of this
Objection. Yet I deeme not this an vnprofitable Demand; vpon what ground you
ſay, Euery leaſt doubting in any matter of Faith (if it be infallible)
<hi>though reſiſted and inuoluntary,</hi> is a damnable ſinne,
<hi>abſolutely deſtructiue, ſo long as it laſts, of true and ſaving
Faith?</hi> For, one act formally excludes only that which is naturally
oppoſite to it; and therfor why ſhould <hi>One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary and
inculpable</hi> Act be deſtructiue of all ſauing Faith? If the Doubt be
voluntary and culpable, it deſtroyes, I grant, all true Faith, both
Habituall, and actuall: though euen in this caſe of ſinfull errour you
muſt ſay the contrary, and ſo ouerthrow your owne argument: you, I ſay,
who [Pag. 368. N. 49.] teach, that a voluntary and ſinfull errour againſt
one Article of Faith may ſtand with true Faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of other Poynts,
and the contrary doctrine you tearme <hi>a vaine and groundless fancy;</hi> and
therfor in your Principles one may belieue with abſolute certainty ſome
Poynts, (V. G. that there is a God, or that Chriſtian Religion is probable,
which you pretend to belieue with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; or the other examples which I
ſpecifyd aboue out of your owne doctrine) and yet doubt of euidency in ſome
other poynt of Faith; and ſo you muſt grant, that euery inuoluntary doubt
is not deſtructiue of all infallible and certaine Faith, as you aſſumed
in your Objection, which now your ſelfe muſt anſwer.</p>
            <p n="56">56. Beſide, you ſpeake very confuſedly in affirming,
that euery leaſt doubting, though reſiſted, would be deſtructiue ſo
long as it laſteth, of all true and ſauing Faith, without declaring,
whether you ſpeake of Habituall or actuall Faith, or of both. Acts, if we
ſpeake naturally, and Philoſophically, do not directly and immediatly
deſtroy the contrary Habit, and therfor there is no reaſon why an
involuntary doubt, ſhould deſtroy the Habit of Faith. But you will ſay;
At leaſt euery Doubt is deſtructiue of the Act of Faith. becauſe we
cannot at the ſame tyme doubt of that thing which we belieue with Certainty,
whether ſuch a doubt be voluntary, or inuoluntary. I Anſwer: I haue ſayd
already, that an inuoluntary doubt, or a doubt reſiſted, is not receyued in
our vnderſtanding, and therfor cannot exclude the contrary certaine Act of
Faith. Yet if for declaring the matter, we will make an impoſſile
ſuppoſition, that an errour inuoluntary, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d conſequently no ſinne, is
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in our vnderſtanding, I ſay, in that caſe it will not deſtroy
the act of Diuine Faith, morally; but only phyſically (by a naturall in
compoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, <pb n="78" facs="tcp:59214:48"/>or incompatibility in the ſame
ſubject, or vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding) it hinders the exerciſe therof; which may
happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not only by ſuch a doubt as we ſpeake of, but alſo by other
lawfull occaſions, as sleepe, ſerious appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to ſome buſiness
requiring a perfect attention, or by a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to exerciſe an Act
of Faith in ſome circumſtances, wherin one knowes he is not obliged therto;
and yet theſe thinges, and the like, which for the tyme exclude an Act of
faith, muſt according to your Objection, be damnable ſinnes, as
deſtructiue of all both <hi>infallible</hi> and <hi>probable</hi> Faith,
becauſe they are incompatible with the actuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of any either
<hi>certaine,</hi> or only <hi>probable</hi> Aſſent. In how many
reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects is your Objection proued to be weake, and contradictory to your
ſelfe?</p>
            <p n="57">57. Object: 4. In the ſame Pag. 326. N. 4. you ſay:
<hi>The ſame is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly confirmed by euery deliberate ſinne that any
Chriſtian committs; by any progress in charity that he makes. For, ſeing as
S. Iohn aſſures vs, our faith is the victory which ouercomes the world,
certainly if the faith of all true belieuers were perfect, (and if true faith
be canable of no imperfection, if all faith be a knowledge moſt certaine and
infallible, all faith muſt be perfect; for, the moſt imperfect that is,
according to your doctrine, if it be true, muſt be moſt certaine, and
ſure the moſt perfect that is, cannot be more than moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) then
certainly their victory over the world, and therfor over the fleſh, and
therfor over ſinne, muſt of necesſity be perfect; and ſo it should be
imposſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any true believer to committ any deliberate ſinne; and
therfore he that committs any ſinne, muſt not thinke himſelfe a true
believer. Beſides, ſeing faith worketh by Charity, and Charity is the
effect of faith: Certainly if the cauſe were perfect, the effect would be
perfect, and conſequently as you make no degrees in faith, ſo there would
be none in Charity, and ſo no man could posſibly make any progress in it,
but all true believers should be equally in Charity, as in faith you make them
equall: and from thence it would follow vnavoidably, that whoſoever finds in
himſelfe any true faith, muſt preſently perſwade himſelfe that he is
perfect in Charity: and whoſoever diſcovers in his Charity any
imperfection, muſt not believe that he hath any true faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="58">58. Anſwer: I haue had the patience to ſet downe your
Objection at large, (though the full ſubſtance therof might haue bene
expreſt in very few words) notwithſtanding your repetitions, inferences,
and inuolutions, which I will indeauour to vnfold by degrees, and lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the
weakness of your Argument, in theſe following reflections.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, In conformity to your owne
Argument, you muſt grant, that your <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59214:48"/>victorie ouer the
world, the fleſh, and ſinne, as alſo your Charity, cannot be perfect,
becauſe your faith being acknowledged to be only probable, is ſuppoſed by
your ſelfe to be imperfect, ſince you ſay, we muſt hold that our faith
is perfect, becauſe we belieue it to be certaine. And who would not deteſt
ſuch an imperfect faith, if it were but for this cauſe, that your Charity
cannot be perfect with it, if your owne Argument be good? And heere you put me
vpon a neceſſity to add a new Argument for the infallibility of Faith, to
all the reaſons alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged aboue. For, ſeing men may by Gods
aſſiſtance ouercome the world, and be perfect in Charity, both which
according to you, are meaſured by Faith, it followes that they may haue
perfect faith; and if you can ſay, as you doe; <hi>If the cauſe were
perfect, the effect would be perfect,</hi> much more I may ſay; if the
cauſe be imperfect, the effect (which neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the perfection of the
cauſe) muſt be imperfect; and ſo if your faith, which you ſay is
cauſe of our victory, and of Charity, be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the effect muſt be
imperfect. And therfore, ſeing the effect of victory, and Charity in
Chriſtians, may be, and in many de facto is perfect, it followes clearly,
that they haue not a meere probable, but an infallible perfect faith.</p>
            <p n="59">59. Secondly, your Objection ſtill goes vpon that ground,
that there are no Degrees of perfection in Faith; which I haue demonſtrated
to be euidently falſe, and that all Faith is of the ſame kind, but not of
the ſame Degree; beſides that it hath the imperfection of obſeurity, and
for that cauſe doth not ſo conuince the vnderſtanding, but that it may be
reſiſted, and the contrary belieued: And therfor you cannot inferr vpon
equality of faith in all true Belieuers, that our victory of the world muſt
be equally perfect in all.</p>
            <p n="60">60. Thirdly, if you had cited the teſtimony of S. Iohn as
you ought, the weakness and impertinency of your Argument would haue clearly
appeared. His words are; [1. Ioan: 5. V. 3.4.5.] 
<q rend="margQuotes">This is the Charity of God, that yee
keepe his commandements, and his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not heauy. Becauſe all
that is borne of God, ouercomes the world: and this is the victory that
ouercomes the world, our faith. Who is it that ouercomes the world, but he that
belieues that Ieſus is the ſon of God?</q> Where it is cleare, that S. Iohn
ſpeakes of faith with Charity, which is called by Diuines Fides formata,
faith infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Charity, by which we keepe the commamdements, as he
ſayth [V. 3.] 
<q rend="margQuotes">This is the Charity of God, that yee
keepe his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</q> 
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59214:49"/>And [V. 4.] 
<q rend="margQuotes">All that is borne of God, ouercomes the
world:</q> Now we are borne or regenerated to a new life, or Being, by
juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace, and the Gifts which are giuen with it, of Faith, Hope, and
Charity; and therfor he adds; 
<q rend="margQuotes">This is the victory which ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes the
world,</q> our faith, that is, ſuch a faith as the Regenerate, or they who
receyue a new life, haue, or a liuing faith working by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p n="61">61. Fourthly, according to this true ſenſe, your
Objection is wholy impertinent, as ſpeaking of a naked faith taken alone as
it goes before Charity; as like wiſe it doth not proue that ſuch a naked
faith doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily bring with it Charity, and ſo is the victory ouer
the world. For, what conſequence is it to ſay? Faith as informed with
Charity, cannot be without Charity, or is the victory ouer the world. Therfor
Faith ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by it ſelfe, and conſidered only according to its owne nature
and eſſence, and abſtracting from Charity, is inſeparable from Charity,
and the victory ouer the world. An Argument, no better than this: The Body with
the ſoule, liues and makes a man: Therfor the Body of it ſelfe liues and
makes a man; which is directly againſt S. Iames [C. 2. V. 26.] ſaying: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Euen as the body without the ſpirit, is
dead; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo faith without workes, is dead. This appeares alſo by what
S. Iohn ſayth (V. 5.) Who is he that ouercometh the world, but he that
belieueth that Ieſus is the ſon of God?</q> Which muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of him who ſo belieues in our Sauiour, as that he loues him, and keepes his
comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements. For, meerly to belieue Chriſt is the ſon of God, is but that
Faith, which Proteſtants call Hiſtoricall, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously teach that it
doth not juſtify, nor is inſeparable from Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor is the victory ouer
the world. And therfor interpreters vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this Text of a liuing Faith,
or joyned with Charity. And ſo this place makes againſt you, and proues
that Faith of it ſelfe (though neuer ſo infallible) is not the victory ouer
the world. But the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this mans Socinian probable Faith forces him to
reele from faith to faith; From Hiſtoricall, to Faith of working Miracles;
From juſtifying faith to Hiſtoricall; From both to a No-faith, that is, to
a faith ſo weake, that by it a man may belieue Chriſtian Faith not to be
true, as we noted againſt you by occaſion of the text of S. Paule about
receyuing him who is Weake in faith.</p>
            <p n="62">62. Fiſtly, the whole force of your Argument muſt rely
vpon the truth of this Propoſition; Whatſoeuer the vnderſtanding
propoſes to <pb n="81" facs="tcp:59214:49"/>the will with abſolute certainty, as a
thing to be done, the will cannot but follow the preſcript of the
vnderſtanding; and therfor if Chriſtian Faith be infallible certaine, our
will muſt embrace what it propoſes, and ſo ouercome the world and
ſinne, and be perfect in Charity, which Principle to be palpably falſe, is
euident by Reaſon, Experience, Faith, and by the Doctrine of all
Proteſtants, at leaſt for as much as concernes that kind of Faith wherof we
ſpeake, that is, Hiſtoricall Faith. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dictates, that
notwithſtanding the certainty of Faith, the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may propoſe
profitable, and delightfull objects. For theſe thinges haue no repugnance,
but do conſiſt togeather: It is certaine that this object is honeſt, and
that the ſame object is vnpleaſant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to ſence, honour, profit,
&amp;c: and therfore the will placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe different motiues, the
vnderſtanding, which propoſeth them all, hath no power to neceſſitate
the will to any of them, it being repreſented with as great certainty, that
ſuch an object is difficult, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, or vnprofitable, as it appeares
honeſt and Vertuous. Neither doth certainty in the vnderſtanding,
neceſſitate vs more to embrace it as honeſt, than the like certainty doth
neceſſitate vs to fly from it as vnpleaſant; eſpecially conſidering
that Faith is obſcure, and alluring objects are cleare, euen to ſenſe;
Faith reſpects things to come, or els aboue the reach of our vnderſtanding;
humane objections and objects are of things preſent, or not farr of. Befides,
if certainty did impoſe a neceſſity, it muſt follow, that at the ſame
tyme we muſt effectually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſame object as honeſt, and fly from
it as vnpleaſant, which is impoſſible. We muſt therfor ſay, that it
remaynes in the will, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it ſelfe to which part it pleaſeth,
hauing ſufficient direction from the vnderſtanding for either ſide.
Sinnes were wont to be diuided into ſinnes of Ignorance, and of Knowledg,
that is, committed by Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or with knowledge: but now if certaine
knowledg of good neceſſitate our will to embrace it, no ſinne can
conſiſt with certaine Knowledg of good, and ſo all ſinnes are ſinnes
of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: and that old diſtinction of Philoſophers, and Diuines, muſt
be corrected by this your new Philoſophy and Diuinity.</p>
            <p n="63">63. As for Experience, who knowes not, or rather who teeles
not, that vulgar ſaying: Video meliora, proboque; Deteriora ſequor. I ſee
that which is better, and like it well, but follow that which is worſe.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Laſtly, Faith teaches, that we are indued with
Free-will, which may embrace, or reject, what is propoſed by the
vnderſtanding: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59214:50"/>all Proteſtants, for our
preſent purpoſe, agree with Catholikes, both in regard that they yeald
Freedom of will to Angels, and Adam before their fall, who yet belieued by an

Therfor it doth not neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate our will. Yea euen thoſe Proteſtants
who deny Free-will, hold not that the will is neceſſitated by the Act of
Faith which directs, but by the effectuall particular motion of Grace, which

Theſe things, I ſay, you belieue, or know with certainty: and yet I hope

ouercome the world; that you cannot but keepe all the morall commandements;
that you cannot but auoyde all ſinne; that you cannot but obſerue what is

Hereſyes you here ioyne togeather, though contrary one to an other, and euen
to your ſelfe. For example, of Pelagianiſme, that the will may performe
whatſoeuer the vnderſtanding certainly iudgeth ought to be done, which
takes away the neceſſity of Grace, or motion of the Holy Ghoſt. I ſayd,
that the will may performe; but wheras you teach further, that it muſt of
neceſſity do ſo, you fall from Pelagianiſme to a contrary extreme, by
taking away Freewill (which the very Socinians defend ſo farr, that, to make
men free, they make themſelues ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious, in denying that God can ſee
the future free Acts of our will)

               </gap> you take it away in a
worſe manner than Caluiniſts doe, who <pb n="83" facs="tcp:59214:50"/>conceaue it to be
taken away by ſupernaturall efficacious Grace, or by infuſed juſtifying
Faith: but your doctrine muſt take it away, by euery certaine knowledg,
though it be but naturall, or by Hiſtoricall fallible Faith, and
hiſtoricall Faith according to Caluiniſts, is common to all Chriſtians.
And yet in another reſpect, you fall into the very quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of
Caluiniſme, and puritaniſme, that. Faith once had, can neuer be loſt:
which is againſt moderate Proteſtants, and yourſelfe; with Socinians.

which, I feare, is too much againſt experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. You muſt alſo agree with
Calviniſts in their Doctrine, that only Faith juſtifyes, ſeing as they,
ſo you, teach, that it neceſſarily brings with it charity, and good
works. And to this ſame purpoſe, I ſtill vrge your owne aſſertio,
concerning thoſe to whom you granta Certainty in Faith, and I ſuppoſe you
will not grant that ſuch men are juſtifyed by faith only, and other
Chriſtians by ſome other meanes, V. g. juſtifyng inherent Grace, or with
Faith, Hope, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and therfor you muſt deny, that perfect Charity
muſt neceſſarily flow from an fallible Faith.</p>
            <p n="67">67. Sixtly you ſpeake very imperfectly in ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Charing is the effect of Faith, if</hi> therfor <hi>the cauſe Were
terfect, the effect would be perfect.</hi> For, the Habit of Charity, being
infuſed immediatly by the Holy Ghoſt, is not the effect of Faith, or of any
Acts of our will, no nor of the Acts of Charity it ſelfe. But if you ſpeake
of the Acts of Charity, they proceede from the Habit of Charity; from the
particular helpe and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt and from our will
eleuated by ſuch aſſiſtance, which is freely offered by God, and freely
accepted by the will, but in no wiſe proceeds neceſſarily from Faith,
whoſe office is only to direct and <pb n="84" facs="tcp:59214:51"/>ſhew the object,
without any neceſſitating influence. S. Paule ſayth [1. Cor: 13.13.] The
greater of theſe is Charity, and who euer heard that the effect can be more
perfect than the cauſe? Or if you ſay, that Faith is not the totall, but
only a partiall cauſe of Charity, which therfor may be more noble than Faith
it ſelfe, then, by what logike can you infer, that Charity muſt be perfect
becauſe it is the effect of a partiall cauſe, leſſe perfect than it
ſelfe? Rather according to your diſcourſe, joyned with the words of S.
Paule, that, Faith is less perfect than Chatity, we muſt ſay thus: Charity
is the effect of Faith, and therfor feing the cauſe is imperfect, the effect
muſt be imperfect; which is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to your inference, and
intent. Beſides, from what Philoſophy can you learne, that when ſome
cauſe, or condition, concurrs to the production of an effect, not by it
ſelfe, but neceſſarily requires the company and cooperation of other
cauſes, that ſuch a cauſe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, can by it ſelfe alone produce
ſuch an effect? But let vs ſuppoſe Faith to be the cauſe of Charity,
and by it ſelfe alone ſufficient for mouing our will to Acts of Charity,
doth it follow, that it muſt do ſo irreſiſtibly, and in ſuch manner
as that it remaine not in the power of our will either to exerciſe no act at
all, or to produce a more or leſſe perfect one? Remember your owne

            </p>
            <p n="68">68. Now I retort this Argument, and aske, why a man may not
fall into ſome errour contrary to the truth which he was taught, and which
once he belieued, and committ ſome ſinne which Faith dictates not to be
committed, if Faith teach him only ſufficiently and not <hi>irreſiſtibly;
and who can aſſertaine me, that the direction of Faith is not of this

            <p n="69">69. Seuenthly, you ſay Pag: 329. N. 7.] that, the
Apoſtles belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with certainty, and [P. 37. N. 9.] you grant that they who
liue as <pb n="85" facs="tcp:59214:51"/>they belieue, will be advanced to as great a
certainty, <hi>as thoſe which heard</hi> the Goſpell <hi>from Chriſt
himſelfe, which ſaw with their eyes &amp;c:</hi> and yet I ſuppoſe you
will not deny, but that the Apoſtles, and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, might encreaſe in
Charity, and that, Faith in their vnderſtaning did not impeach the freedom of
their will, without which there can be no obedience, which as your ſelfe
teach [Pag. 329. N. 7.] <hi>can hardly haue place where there is not
posſibility of diſboedience, as there is not when the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandin? does
all, and the will nothing:</hi> Therfor certainty of belief, ſtands well with
freedom to exerciſe Acts of Charity with great or little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or to
committ deliberate ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="70">70. But let vs ſuppoſe, that Certainty in Faith, brings
with it a neceſſity of Charity: what will follow, but that ſuch
neceſſitated acts ſhall not be capable of prayſe, or reprehenſion,
which can only belong to free Actions: and then how can Charity heere be
perfect, if vpon juſt account, and due conſideration, it be not ſo much
as laudable? Or how can any be commended for not committing a deliberate
ſinne, which he cannot committ; I ſind in holy Scripture prayſe giuen, 
<q rend="margQuotes">and eternall glory aſſured to him,
who could tranſgress, and did not tranſgress; doe euill, and did it
not.</q> [Eccli: 31. V. 9.10.] but who will commend one, qui non potuit
tranſgredi &amp; non eſt tranſgreſſus, non potuit facere mala, &amp;
non fecit; Who could not tranſgress, and did not tranſgress, could not
committ evill, and did not committ it? From whence followes, that your
Aſſertion (if faith were infallible, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt needs be perfect) is
ſo farr from being true, that it ſhould not be ſo much as laudable, that
is, the Habit of Charity, could not produce any Actions capable of prayſe: or
if ſuch Actions be free, then it is in the power of the will to exerciſe
perfect, or remiſſe ones, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Gods Grace, and abſtayne from all
ſuch Acts, and ſo Charity ſhall not neceſſarily be perfect. Thus your
Principles, and ſequels, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy themſelues.</p>
            <p n="71">71. Eightly, you teach, That, <hi>if faith were infallible,
it should be imposſible for any true be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Charity muſt be perfect, and <hi>as we make no degrees in faith, ſo there
would be none in Charity,</hi> and <hi>ſo none could posſibly make any
progress in it, but all true belieuer's should be equally in Charity.</hi> In
which words I find ſuch a connection, as in true language ſhould be called
a manifold contradiction. Firſt, in ſaying that ſuch a man could not
committ any deliberate ſinne, you ſeeme to ſuppoſe that he may committ
indelibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <pb n="86" facs="tcp:59214:52"/>ſinnes, which being ſinnes, muſt be
voluntary and free, (though not always ſo perfectly voluntary, as thoſe
which are commited with full deliberation or reflection) and worthly of blame,
and puniſhment, and he who committs, them in that reſpect, loues God with
leſſe perfection than an other, who is more vigilant, and committs ſuch
ſinnes more ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſo all true belieuers ſhould not be equall in
Charity. 2. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible faith take away freewill, it depriues men of power
or poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to committ any ſinne at all, though neuer ſo
indeliberate: Or if it leaue them with freewill, they may committ deliberate
ſinnes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the difference, in this place, of deliberate and
indeliberate ſinnes, is deſtructiue of it ſelfe. 3. Wheras you ſay,
that <hi>as we make no degrees in faith, ſo there would be none in
Charity:</hi> I anſwer; you ſhould haue ſayd the direct contrary; namely,
that ſeing you are not ignorant of our Doctrine, that there be degrees in
Charity, it muſt follow that we alſo belieue that there are degrees in
faith, the Habit wherof is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by euery Act of of Charity; as you
alſo [Pag: 37. N. 9. teach, that faith is encreaſed by <hi>devout and
humble prayer, and ſincere obedience.</hi> But this poynt puts me vpon a
demonſtratiue Argument againſt you, in this manner. You teach, that <hi>if
one liue as he belieues, the ſpirit of God will advance him to a certainty in
faith.</hi> Now let vs propoſe two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one indued with infallible
Faith, who according to your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, muſt therfore be ſo perfect in
Charity, that he can make no progress therin, nor committ any deliberate
ſinne: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>other with your
probable fallible faith, who yet by humble and <hi>deuout prayers, and
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience,</hi> makes continuall progress in Faith and Charity, and
therfor will at length arriue to a degree of Faith, and Charity, equall to him,
whom we at firſt ſuppoſed to be indued with infallible Faith, and perfect
Charity, which being not inſinite, the other by dayly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement of faith,
and Charity, may and muſt at length arriue to the ſame degree of
perfection; And then all your Objections againſt vs for our infallible Faith,
do inſtantly fall heauy vpon your ſelfe, who will be demanded, whether
ſuch a man can committ any deliberate ſinne, or make any progress in
Charity? If he cannot do either of theſe, why do you infer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as abſured in vs, the very
ſame ſequele which your ſelf muſt grant? If he can do both theſe
things, that is, committ delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinnes, and make progress in Charity,
why do you ſay that he cannot doe ſo? I do not ſee, how you can auoyd
this Dilemma, and contradiction with your ſelfe.</p>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:59214:52"/>
            <p n="72">72. Ninthly, you ſay: <hi>Whoſoeuer fynds in himſelfe
any true faith, muſt preſently perſwade himſelfe that he is perfect in
Charity: and whoſoeuer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers in his Charity any imperfection, muſt
not belieue that he hath any true faith.</hi> But theſe or like ſequeles,
follow from your owne, not from any doctrine of ours. For, ſeing on the one
ſide you teach, that by Prayer, progress in Charity, and obedience, men will
arriue to the ſpirit of obſignation and perfect faith; and on the other,
that, faith is the cauſe and meaſure of Charity, it followes, that
whoſoeuer fynds in himſelfe ſuch a perfect faith, (which he muſt haue,
becauſe he is obliged to liue as he belieues) muſt preſently perſwade
himſelfe, that he is perfect in Charity: and whoſoeuer diſcouers in his
Charity any imperfection, muſt not belieue that he hath ſuch a faith, as he
ſhould haue. Euery one therfor is obliged to haue a perfect faith, both
becauſe he is obliged to liue as he belieues, and to make progreſſe in
Charity, which will be the cauſe of a perfect faith; as alſo becauſe
Faith, according to you, is the cauſe of Charity, and ſo becauſe we are
bound to keepe the commandements, and to haue Charity, which is the effect, we
muſt haue faith, which is the cauſe: and ſo vpon a double account, we are
obliged to a perfect faith, both as Charity, or liuing as we ought, is the
cauſe of faith, and as faith is the cauſe of Charity, to which all being
obliged, they are by conſequence obliged to procure the cauſe therof, which
you ſay is faith. Wherfor vpon the whole matter, your probable faith,
remaines only to ſuch, as keepe not the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor liue as they
belieue; which if they did, God would rayſe them higher to a certainty. For,
thus you ſay, [Pag: 37. N. 9.] <hi>God will accept of the weakeſt and
loweſt degree of faith, if it be truing, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to true
obedience;</hi> and; rhat for <hi>ſincere obedience God may and will rayſe
men</hi> higher to a Certainty. Therfor a primo ad vltimum, the weakeſt
Faith, if it be effectuall to obedience, will bring men to certainty: Therfore
none de facto want ſuch a certainty, except they whoſe faith is not liuing
nor effectuall to obedience. And further; ſeing you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess yours not to be
certaine, it muſt follow, that it is not effectuall to true obedience;
otherwiſe it would be improued to a Certainty.</p>
            <p n="73">73. But this is not all, that occurrs to be ſayd in this
poynt. Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>member your doctrine [Pag: 379. N. 70.] and elſwhere, that
repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance neceſſary to ſaluation, requires <hi>effectuall dereliction
and mortification of all vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

performes, exerciſes very perfect obedience, and ſhall not fayle of 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59214:53"/>being rayſed higher to a Certainty of faith. Therfor your
fallible faith will remaine only in ſinners. For, if one either giue
himſelfe to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience, and ſo fall not into great ſinne, or
truly repent by your kind of repentance, he muſt paſſe to a certainty of
Faith, and ſo all in ſtate of ſaluation, both Saints, that is, who haue
not ſinned mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, and repentant ſinners, cannot want the ſpirit of
Obſignation, as you call it, and certaine Faith. Why then do you deceiue the
world, and delude poore ſoules, with a fallible faith, or perſwaſion, and
not abſolutely proclaime to the world, that infallible Faith is
neceſſary, ſince euen according to your grounds, it is neceſſary for
all ſorts of people;</p>
            <p n="74">74. Now all your Objections, and my Anſwers, being
vnpartially conſidered, let any man judge whether your Arguments deſerue
ſuch epithetons as you giue them, of demonſtratiue, conuincing,

repugnant not only to Truth, but euen to all Religion and Piety, ſit for

And therfor I muſt intreat and adjure you, either to diſcouer vnto me

Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, than Picteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who profess Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Religion to be
infallible, and, I belieue, will not belieue your bare word, that theſe
conſequences are cleare: Chriſtian Hiſtoricall Faith is infallibly true:
Therfor it muſt be loſt by any leaſt doubting, though reſiſted, (that
is, by a no-doubt, as I haue ſhewed) it muſt be incompatible with any
deliberate ſinne: it muſt bring with it Charity ſo perfect, that we can
make no progress therin. For my part, I do in no wiſe vnderſtand ſuch
deductions, nor how any man of vnderſtanding ſhould take them for good, as
I haue <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59214:53"/>ſhewed more than ſufficiently; though yet I
muſt add, that though the conſequences which you pretend to deduce from our
doctrine, be ſtrange and portentuous in themſelues, yet to you they ought
not to ſeeme ſo or at leaſt ought not to be publikly avouched by you for
ſuch. For, beſides that the very ſame conſequences, which you deduce
from our doctrine, follow from your owne aſſertions, (as I haue proued)
anſwer, I beſeech you theſe few Demands. 1. Whether it be more
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that true Diuine Faith ſhould be inconſiſtent with an
involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Doubt, (which you inferr againſt vs as a great abſurdity) or,
that it ſhould be compatible with a voluntary, ſinfull, damnable, not only
Doubt, but poſitiue aſſertive Errour; as you teach (Pag. 368. N. 49.) and
call the contrary doctrine <hi>a vaine and groundless fancy,</hi> as I
obſerved aboue; or that it may ſtand with an aſſent, that probably it
may be falſe; or, with a preparation of mynd to forſake it, if ſeeming
better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons offer themſelves againſt it, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you conceive your
ſelfe to haue for it, which, for ought you know, may happen, as I ſhewed
above. 2. Whether it be worſe, that all ſhould of neceſſity be perfect
in charity, by an Infallible Faith, or that none can be perfect; as it
ineuitably followes out of your Tenets put togeather; That, Faith is only
probable and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and yet that the meaſure of our victory over the
world, and of our charity, muſt be taken from Faith, which you ſay is the
cauſe of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the effect cannot be more perfect than the cauſe.
Beſides, your brethren the Calviniſts believe, that men are juſtifyed by
a ſirme and certaine Faith that they are juſt, and that charity and good
works are inſeparable from ſuch a Faith: and then ſeing according to your
owne words, if the cauſe be perfect, the effect muſt be perfect, and that
the cauſe of charity is (in their opinion) perfect, that is a ſirme and
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Faith, it followes, that their charity muſt of neceſſity be
perfect, and that no juſt man can make any progress therin. 3. Whether it be
more abſurd, to hold an impoſſibility of committing any deliberate
ſinne; or to belieue that all our beſt actions are deadly ſinnes. Or
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be worſe to teach, that one cannot breake the commandements,
which you, againſt all truth, impute to vs, Or, that he cannot keepe them,
euen with the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, which is the common doctrine of
Proteſtants. Thus then, it is not our doctrine, but the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of you and
your brethren, that muſt in many reſpects make men negligent of making any
progress in Faith or charity. And what a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxe is this? A weake and
fallible Faith makes men diligent in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59214:54"/>Progress in
charity, and a ſtrong infallible Faith is <hi>fit for nothing but to make men
negligent of making any progress in Faith or Charity,</hi> as yon are pleaſed
ſtrangly to ſpeake, directly againſt the admonition of S. Peter, (1. Pet:
5.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">cui reſiſtite fortes in Fide, whom
reſiſt, ſtrong in Faith:</q> Not weake in Faith, as he ſhould haue
ſpoken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your portentuous Divinity. Morover, ſince you object
againſt vs, that, if Faith be infallible, men cannot increaſe in charity,
and yet yourſelfe, (Pag. 36. N, 9.) Teach, that <hi>the ſpirit of God being
implored by devout and humble prayer and ſincere obedience, may and will by
degrees advance his ſervants higher, and give them a certainty of adherence
beyond their certainty of evidence, and make them know what they did but
believe,</hi> (Which certainty, according to your Objection againſt vs,
muſt be cauſe that they cannot increaſe in charity) what will follow, but
that, men will be not only careless, but fearfull to pray, to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and
exerciſe acts of charity, leaſt by degrees they be advanced to a certainty
of knowledg, and loſſe of freewill, and a period in charity, and be as it
were ſettled in termino, while they are in via, or without poſſibility to
grow better by any endeavour of their owne, or exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations or others; And
thus their obedience and charity being cauſe of ſuch a certainty in Faith,
and this certainty hindring all progress in charity, we muſt inferr a primo
ad vltimum, that charity is moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall and pernicious to charity
itſelfe. Theſe are the fruites of your Doctrine, and conſequences of your
Objections againſt vs.</p>
            <p n="76">76. Object 5. To prove that Faith cannot be certaine, if it
be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, you ſpend many words (Pag. 329. N. 7.) but bring no reaſon
beſides a meere reſolute aſſirmation, that it is ſo. And (Pag 330 N
7.) you ſay, <hi>Looke what degree of aſſent is infuſed into the
vnderſtanding, at leaſt the ſame degree of evidence muſt be infuſed
into the object. And for you to require a ſtrength of credit beyond the
appearance of the objectes credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is all one as if you should require me
to goe ten myles an houre vpon a horſe that will goe but five; to diſcerne
a man certainty through a miſt or cloud that makes him not certainly

And; <hi>That I should believe the truth of any thing, the truth wherof cannot
be made evident with an evidence proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the degree of Faith
requirea of me, this, I ſay, far any man to be <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59214:54"/>bound to,
is vnjuſt, and vnreaſonable, becauſe to doe it is imposſible.</hi> And
N. 8. <hi>I deny that it is required of vs to be certaine in the higheſt
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, infallibly certaine of the truth of the things which we believe; for
this were to know, and not believe, neither is it tesſible vnless our
evidence of it, be it naturall, or ſupernaturall, were of the higheſt

vnderſtanding.</hi> Heere you ſee what he affirmes, without ſo much as
offering to giue any reaſon or proofe And therfor.</p>
            <p n="77">77. I Anſwer: as you object by meerly affirming, ſo I
might anſwer, by ſimply denying. But I will alledge a proofe aboue all
exception; which is, your owne doctrine delivered more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once. (Pag: 36. 37.
N. 9. <hi>The ſpirit of God may and will advance his ſervants higher, and
giue them a certainty of adherence beyond their certainty of evidence.</hi>
And: P. 112 N. 154. <hi>Gods ſpirit, if he pleaſe, may worke more, a
certainty of adherence beyond a certainty of euidence.</hi> Behold a certainty
of adherence beyond the certainty of evidence. (And, Pag. 37. N. 9.) <hi>To
thoſe that believe, and liue according to their Faith, God gives by degrees
the ſpirit of obſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confirmation, which makes them know (though
how, they know not) what they did but belieue.</hi> If theſe men know,
(though how, they know not,) why do you impugne divine Faith, which is the Gift
of Gods Spirit, and all good Chriſtians believe, and in a manner feele to be
infallible, becauſe you do not vnderſtand or know the how, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
therof? Why do you not ſay: I believe infallibly; and though I know not how,
yet it is ſufficient that I know my Faith is from God, who by his particular
Grace, can doe more than I can comprehend? Why are you not as reaſonable to
the old infallible Faith, taught, and believed by all Chriſtians, as you are
to your new proſelytes, who, you ſay, will be advanced to a certainty above
evidence? And wheras you ſay, that this were to require you, to goe ten miles
vpon a horſe that will goe but ſive; to heare a ſound more clearly then
it is audible; to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a thing more fully than it is intelligible, in
ſtead of proving, you do but begg the queſtion, and ſuppoſe that
nothing is certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible or credible, vnless it be evident, which is
the very poynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, and we affirme, that our vnderſtanding, may in
this ſenſe go ten miles, though in darke; may intellectually heare a found
which is audible, and vnderſtand a thing intelligible, though not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
And in this manner your ſelfe muſt ſay, and anſwer for thoſe who 
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59214:55"/>you believe may attaine a certainty beyond euidence; and
yet you will not yield that they vnderſtand a thing more fully, than it is
intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And then you muſt retract what you ſayd, that, <hi>to
believe a thing, the truth wherof cannot be made evident with an evidence
proportionable to the degree of Faith required of me, is vnjuſt, becauſe to
do it is imposſible.</hi> S. Paule defines Faith to be 
<q rend="margQuotes">Argumentum non apparentium,</q> an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of things which
appeare not: Therfor thinges not evident, muſt be believed: and to ſay,
that they cannot be believed with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, though they do not appeare with
evidence, is injurious to Gods Power, as if he could not by his ſpeciall
ſupernaturall Grace and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is required to every Act of Faith,
ſupply the want of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Neither can there be ſhewed, any ſuch
eſſentiall conjunction, betweene evidence, and certainty, that this may not
conſiſt without that. There may at firſt ſight appeare ſome ſhew of
repugnance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene evidence and obſcurity; certainty, (which ſeemes to
exclude all poſſibility of feare that the contrary be true) and probability
(which of it ſelfe excludes not ſuch feare) and yet your ſelfe ſay
(pag: 25. N. 29.) <hi>whether knowledg and Opinion touching the ſame thinge,
may ſtand together, is made a Queſtion in the ſchooles:</hi> and it is
very commonly held, that they may ſtand togeather, in the ſame
vnderſtanding: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are there wanting very learned men who thinke they
may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent in the ſame Act. If then evidence and obſcurity,
certainty and probability, may ſtand togeather, what ground can you bring to
prove an incompatibility between Certainty, and Obſcurity, which carry no
ſhew of repugnance, in any kind of thoſe Oppoſitions, which Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
haue ſet downe? Perhaps you have an erroncous imagination, as if the
obſcurity of Faith ought to be compared with the evidence of ſcience, or
Demonſtration, as a privation with the oppoſite forme, as darknees with
light, or as ignorance or Errour with knowledg; and ſo conceive it
impoſſible, that ſuch obſcurity can ſland with certainty, which
muſt needs bring with it ſome intellectuall light. Which imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation you
ſeeme to diſcover (Pag: 325. N. 2.) where you ſay, <hi>That Science and

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nke
are things ſo plaine, that you will not require any proofe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> In
which words you muſt ſuppoſe, that the objects of faith are abſolutely
vnknowne, as if Faith were a privation of all light or knowledg: and yet with
little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to your owne words, (Pag: 25. N. 29. you ſay:)
<hi>whether know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and <pb n="93" facs="tcp:59214:55"/>Opinyon touching the ſame thing, may
ſtand togeather, is made a Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Schooles:</hi> which according to
you, could be no queſtion, if opinion had no knowledg or light at all,
becauſe <hi>the knowledg of a thing abſolutely vnknowne, is,</hi> ſay
you, a plaine implicancy. Which words, as I ſayd of Faith, ſeeme to
ſuppoſe, that Opinion is a privation, or negation of knowledg, or evidence.
But in this, you are much miſtaken. For the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of Faith, ought not
to be compared with the light of ſcience, as a privation which the forme
oppoſite to it: But as a thing less perfect, with an other more perfect, or
as a ſmall light with a greater. Every Act of our vnderſtanding, which is
the eye of our ſoule, muſt involve ſome light, or clearness, as every,
even imperfect ſight of our corporall eye, is endued with ſome evidence,
which, in compariſon of a more perfect ſight, or act of ſeeing, may be
tearmed obſcure, though in it ſelfe, it hath both ſome clearness, and an
abſolute certainty, that it ſees that object which it ſees, though dimly,
and as it were through a miſt, or in ſome darkiſh place. As S. Peter (Ep:
2. C. 1.19.) compares Faith to 
<q rend="margQuotes">a candel ſhining in a dark place.</q> Which words do
excellently express, both the ſhining or light, and alſo the obſcurity of
Faith. Since then Faith is endued with ſome light, or evidence, no reaſon
can be given, why ſuch a light may not be joyned with certainty by the moſt
prudent command of the will, which keepes our vnderſtanding ſtedfaſt to
the Object, and the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, which elevates, and enables it
to an Act proportionable to the Divine Revelation, and Teſtimony. Nay rather,
abſtracting from that which we fynd by vſuall, and naturall courſe of
thinges, or experience, (which ought not to be put in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with Gods
Omnipotency, it is harder, to give a reaſon, why they may not ſtand
togeather naturally, than to imagine with any colour of reaſon, that they are
incompoſſible, by a ſupernaturall aſſiſtance, and grace of the holy
Ghoſt. And therfor Divines with the Angelicall Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour S. Thomas only ſay,
that our vnderſtanding without evidence, is like to a ſtone out of its
center, but not that it cannot poſſibly be made ſure of any truth without
it.</p>
            <p n="78">78. But, you ſay, [P. 330. N. 7.] <hi>Whatſoever effect
is wrought meerly by meanes, muſt be are proportion to, and cannot exceed the
vertue of the meanes by which it is whrought: as nothing by water can be made
more cold than water, nor by fire more hot than fire, nor by honey more ſweet
than honey, nor by gall, more bitter than gall,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="79">79. The Anſwer to this Objection is very eaſy, by
granting all that <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59214:56"/>you inferr, if you meane that the
Aſſent which we giue meerly for the Arguments of Credibility, conſidered
in themſelues, is no ſtronger than thoſe Arguments can make it. This we
willingly grant, but abſolutely deny, that Diuine Faith is meaſured by
thoſe Arguments, and not by Diuine Reuelation, and Gods ſupernaturall
Grace. And ſo your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſire, water, honey, and gall proue only,
that Chriſtian Faith cannot be ſtronger than Gods Teſtimony, and Grace,
which are the cauſes of Faith; which no man denyes. This Anſwer is eaſy
and cleare; but yet by way of ſupererogation, I will add theſe
conſiderations, which will ſhew that your examples make againſt your
ſelfe. Firſt: A thing by water may be made more cold than water &amp;c: if
water, or fire be eleuated by Diuine Power, to worke above their owne naturall
forces, and produce in an other ſubject, more intenſe cold or heate, than
they haue in themſelues. For, as by miracle fire may be hindered from
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any heate, or other naturall effect, ſo it may be enabled to
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more perfect effects, than it could haue done by its owne power. Thus
all your inſtances may be applyed againſt your ſelfe; That as fire may be
eleuated to effects aboue it ſelfe, ſo our vnderſtanding may be raiſed
aboue the aſſent, which it can receiue from the Arguments of Credibility,
by a pious and prudent command of the will, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion of the Holy
Ghoſt. 2. Although the heate of fire, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of water &amp;c: conſidered
in themſelues, cannot make any thing more cold, or hot, than themſelues,
yet if they be taken as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of water or fire, ordayned to make way to
introduce the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of fire and water in to other ſubjects, they
concurr as diſpoſitions to the production of thinges more perfect than
themſelues, that is, the ſubſtantiall formes of water and ſire, in
ſuch ſort as thoſe formes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but follow thoſe diſpoſitions:
and in this ſence, a thing by heate may be made more hot than the heate it
ſelfe, in regard that ſuch a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, neceſſarily introduceth fire which
is the fountaine, and eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more hot, than any particular heate proceeding
from it. Now in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to this your example. I ſay, that, as ſuch
Accidents as are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to a ſubſtantiall forme, concurr to an
effect more noble than themſelves; ſo Arguments of Credibility, as they
poynt at Diuine Revelation (as S. Iohn ſhewed a greater Authority than his
owne, by bearing witness of our Saviour) may diſpoſe vs to an Aſſent of
Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, wherby they may truly be ſayd to exceed themſelves, as
they are meerly conſidered in themſelves, without further relation to a
more <pb n="95" facs="tcp:59214:56"/>noble Forme, or Aſſent, to which they prepare vs;
becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our vnderſtanding, that there is good reaſon, and
obligation, to belieue ſome Truths as witneſſed by God, the will is
obliged, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der payne of damnation, effectually to move the vnderſtanding, to
the belief of ſuch Articles, with an Aſſent proportionable to that
ſupreme Authority, which the vnderſtanding not being able to doe by its
owne forces, and God commanding nothing impoſſible, there cannot be wanting
the neceſſary concurrence and ſpeciall Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, for
producing an Act of Divine, ſupernaturall, infallible Faith.</p>
            <p n="80">80. Your ſelfe ſay, [Pag: 331. N. 9.] <hi>There is
abundance of Arguments exceedingly credible, inducing men to belieue the truth
of Chriſtianity: I ſay, ſo credible, that though they cannot make vs
evidently ſee what we belieue, yet they evidently convince that in true
wiſdome and prudence, the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of it deſerue credit, and ought to be
accepted as things revealed by God,</hi> and therfor, ſay I, with an
Aſſent more certaine than can proceed from humane Authority, or meere
Arguments of Credibility. 3. Divers great Philoſophers hold, that Accidents
are not only diſpoſitions to the ſubſtantiall Forme, but reall cauſes
therof, immediatly producing it, as they are inſtruments of the Principall
ſubſtantiall Agents, and make vp as it were one totall Cauſe with them.
According to this Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, your inſtances make againſt your ſelfe,
and do confirme the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of ſome grave Diuines, that if we conſider
the Arguments of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, not as they are mere inducements, precedent, and
diſpoſing to Faith, only ſhewing the object therof, but as they integrate
the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall object, or Divine Revelation, we muſt ſay, that they are
eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and raiſed vp to be part of the object, and immediately cauſes of
the Aſſent of Faith, not of their owne force or taken alone, but joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with, and conveying to our vnderſtanding the Divine Revelation, wherby they
grow to be the voyce and teſtimony, or as it were reall letters of God
ſpeaking to men by them. For which cauſe, S. Paule [Heb: 2.4.] affirmes
miracles to be a certaine ſpeach of God, ſaying: 
<q rend="margQuotes">God withall witneſſing by ſignes
and wonders:</q> where Theodoretus ſayth, that God by miracles giues a
teſtimony to preaching Miracles therfor are in ſome manner the very voyce
of God. Whence, S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine [Ep: 49. Quaeſt. 6.] abſolutely ſayeth: 
<q rend="margQuotes">God ſpeakes by won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workes. And
[Marc: vlt:] it is God cooperating, and by ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes confirming what they
ſpoke. And [Ioan 10.] Chriſt our Lord ſayd concerning his owne workes;
They give teſtimony of me.</q> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, <pb n="96" facs="tcp:59214:57"/>ſay theſe
Divines, Arguments of Credibility, may be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove themſelues; And
ſo your examples, and inſtances make nothing againſt vs, but do confute
your ſelfe. Which contradicting of your ſelfe, as in many other
occaſions, ſo heere alſo forces me to ſtay yet a little, in obſerving
a couple of your contraryetyes, or contradictions.</p>
            <p n="81">81. The one is in theſe words, [Pag: 329. and 330.]
<hi>If you ſpeake of an acquired, rationall, diſcurſive faith, theſe
Reaſons which make the object ſeeme credible, muſt be the cauſe of it.
If you ſpeake of a ſupernaturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed faith, then you either
ſuppoſe it infuſed by the former meanes, and then that which was ſayd,
muſt be ſayd againe, &amp;c:</hi> Do not theſe words diſtroy
themſelues? Or what ſenſe can they beare? An acquired, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
diſcurſive faith cauſed by Reaſons which make the object cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and
a ſupernaturall infuſed faith, infuſed by the former meanes, that is, by
the Reaſons which make the object ſeeme credible? If an acquired,
rationall, diſcurſive faith be cauſed by the Reaſons which make the
Object credible, and a ſupernaturall infuſed faith be cauſed by the
ſame meanes and Reaſons, how do you diſtinguiſh a faith ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
from a faith in the ſame manner infuſed? Or rather, how can it be a
ſupernaturall infuſed Faith, if it be cauſed by the ſame meanes, by
which an acquired diſcurſive faith is cauſed? In a word how is the ſame
faith acquired, and ſupernaturally infuſed.</p>
            <p n="82">82. Your other contradiction, I fynd (Pag: 36. and 37. N.
9.) And (Pag: 112. N. 154.) in both which places, you grant to ſome <hi>a
certainty of adherence beyond a certainty of evidence,</hi> and yet in the
former places you ſay of ſuch men, that <hi>the ſpirit of obſignation
or confirmation makes them know what they did but believe.</hi> Now if they
know that they did but believe, how is their certainty of adherence beyond
their certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of evidence, ſeing you put ſuch a knowledg as is more than
Faith, which implyes obſcurity, and conſequently ſuch a knowledg is
indued with evidence; and yourſelfe (Pag: 325. N. 2.) ſaie: He that
<hi>doth ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely and meerly believe, doth never know,</hi> and that
<hi>ſcience and knowledg are ſynonymous termes.</hi> Therfor you ſpeak of
an evident knowledg; and then I ſay how comes their certainty of adheſion
to be beyond their certainty of evidence; Or how can you ſpeake of a
certainty of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion beyond the certainty of evidence. Who (Pag: 330. N.
7.) ſay, <hi>That power which infuſeth into the vnderſtanding aſsent,
muſt alſo infuſe Evidence into the object: and looke what degree of
aſſent is infuſed into the vnderſtanding at leaſt the ſame degree
of evidence, muſt be infuſed into the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> 
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:59214:57"/>If
at leaſt the ſame degree of evidence muſt be infuſed into the object
which is in the Aſſent, how can the Aſſent be beyond the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of
the object?</p>
            <p n="83">83. To theſe your contradictions, I add your ſaying
[Pag: 37. N. 9.] <hi>What God gives as a reward to believers, is one thing: and
what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of all men, as their duty is an other: and what he will
accept of, out of grace and favour, is yet an other. To thoſe that believe,
and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their faith, he gives by degrees the ſpirit of

to believe, and live according to their faith; to have a faith effectuall to
obedience, and working by love, is required of <hi>all as their duty;</hi>
ſuch a faith, I ſay, is required, and will be accepted by the law which God

and the will nothing.</hi> And yet that it is Neceſſitated, is a cleare
truth; ſince <pb n="98" facs="tcp:59214:58"/>you profeſſe to believe with no more
certainty, than is evidently dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from evident Premiſes, and the
vnderſtanding is no less neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to give aſſent to a probable
concluſion, drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en probable Premiſes, than it is

demonſtratiue Premiſes. (Pag: 331. N. 8.) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſett downe ſome
Principles, which you judg to be evident and certaine, you conclude thus;
<hi>From all theſe Premiſes, this Concluſion evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows, that it
is infallibly certaine that we are firmly to believe the truth of Chriſtian
Religion.</hi> And in the ſame (Pag. 331. N. 9.) <hi>There is an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Arguments exceedingly credible, inducing men to believe the truth of
Chriſtianity: I ſay, ſo credible, that though they cannot make vs
evidently ſee what we believe, yet they evidently convince that in true
wiſdome and prudence the Articles of it deſerue credit, and ought so be
accepted as things revealed by God.</hi> therfor there is convincing evidence
for the truth of Chriſtian Articles, as farr as you believe them. And (Pag:
36. N. 9.) you affirme that <hi>God requires of all, that their Faith should be
proportionable to the motiues and Reaſons enforcing to it.</hi> If the
Reaſons enforce to the Concluſion, how is it not neceſſitated; Therfor
your Faith is both free according to your owne words, and neceſſitated
according to truth in your grounds; which is alſo convinced by your ſaying,
that certainty cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out evidence: And therfor the Faith of your
choiſe elevated people, which you ſay is certaine, muſt be evident, and
conſequently not free. But our Faith rayſing vs above the evident Arguments
of Credibility, remaines free, and is in no ſenſe neceſſitated.</p>
            <p n="86">86. II. For your epithetons, of being certaine and
vncertaine: we profess and believe nothing more certainly, than that our Faith
is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and not capable either of falſhood, or vncertainty. But your
Booke is Chiefly imployed to prove your Faith not to be certaine, and we are
well content it be ſo. Yet if you remember what you ſay of your
choyſeſt perſons and beſt Believers, that they have a certainty beyond
evidence, and yet expressly teach, that certainty cannot be greater than the
evidence of the Object, (as I ſhewed above) it followes clearly, that you
give them a certainty which your ſelf hold impoſſible fot any to have,
and ſo you give them certainty and not certainty, that is a meere
contradiction, or nothing.</p>
            <p n="87">87. III. For the denominations of Evident; Obſcure; They
agree not to our Faith, which we believe to be Obſcure, not evident, as I
have explicated elſwhere. But for your Faith, according to your grounds 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59214:58"/>it muſt be both evident and obſcure, Evident, becauſe
you believe with no greater aſſent than you receyve by evident Arguments;
and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly you ſay (Pag: 329. N. 7.) <hi>Nothing is more repugnant,
than that a man should be required to give moſt certaine credit vnto that
which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made appeare moſt certainly credible: And if it appeare to
him to be ſo, then it is not obſcure that it is ſo.</hi> According to
which, we muſt ſay, that nothing is more vnreaſonable, than that a man
ſhould be required to give probable credit, vnto that which cannot be made
appeare proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly credible; and if <hi>it appeare to him to be ſo, then it is
not obſcure that it is ſo.</hi> Therfore in your grounds, you muſt
believe nothing to be true, but according to the evidence which you have
therof; And therfor (Pag. 330. N. 7.) you ſay in express termes: <hi>That I
should believe the truth of any thing, the truth wherof cannot be made evident
with an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence proportionable to the degree of Faith required of me, this, I
ſay, for any man to be bound to, is vnjuſt and vnreaſonable, becauſe to
do it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posſible.</hi> Therfor your Faith is evident in reſpect of the
truth which you believe, according to the meaſure of your belief therof. If
you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with certainty, a truth for which you haue only probable
argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuch a truth I grant were not evident in proportion to your
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but ſince you believe the truth of Chriſtian Religion, only
with a probable aſſent, and that you have evidence of thoſe Reaſons,
which cauſe your aſſent to ſuch a truth, it is cleare that your Faith
is evident to you as farr as your belief goes. And yet you muſt hold it to be
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; otherwiſe it could not be capable of obedience; as you pretend it
to be; becauſe you ſay there can be no obedience where the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
doe all, and the will nothing.</p>
            <p n="88">88 Fourthly: You ſay, our Faith is prudent and fooliſh.
That our Faith is prudent, and yours imprudent, Charity Maintayned hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

remayne imprudent indeed, and prudent in your words. And indeed none but an
enemy to Chriſtianity, can affirme our Faith and Religion to be imprudent, if
he conſider well, what a deadly wound he gives to Chriſtian Religion, by
ſaying ſo. For, take from vs the Marks of a true Religion which are

eſsentiall to it, and part of the definition of it, and did as if one being
to ſay what a man is, should define him a reaſonable creature that hath
skill in Aſtronomy. For as all Aſtronomers are men, but all men are not

Aſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy ought not to be put into the definition of men, where nothing
should have place but what agrees to all men: So though all that are truly
wiſe, (that is, wiſe for eternity) will believe aright, yet many may
beleeve aright which are not wiſe.</hi> By which words you give vs to
vnderſtand, that it would not be very much prejudicall to your Faith to be
imprude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; as it is nothing againſt the difinition of a man, that he is not
an Aſtronomer. And who would be of that Religion, and Faith, which
confeſſedly may be imprudent and fooliſh, wheras true Chriſtian Faith
muſt needs be prudent. And you were too forward [to ſay no worſe] in
ſaying ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Charit: Maintayned</hi> was miſtaken therin.
For, if Prudence be required to every true act of morall vertue, ſhall we
ſay, that true Faith may be imprudent? But you ſpeake according to your
ſkill in Socinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Pelagian Hereſy, which denyes that every act of true
Faith is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially ſupernaturall, and requires the ſupernaturall
motion of the Holy Ghoſt, for the production therof. For how can an act
ſupernaturall in eſſence, be imprudent, ſince this is alwayes a defect
only of man, and can never be a ſpeciall effect of God, as all things

<q rend="margQuotes">He who ſoone believes, is light of

belief (all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) imprudent, ſhould be indeed a true act of
Faith, produced by the Habit of Faith, and particular impulſion of the Holy
Ghoſt, you have not prooved, notwithſtanding your confident avouching that
queſtionless your Adverſary was miſtaken; wheras yourſelf was much
miſtaken in your example of having skill in Aſtronomy, which is a quality
wholy impertinent and vnneceſſary to a man, as prudence is not to the acts
of our Faith: Though yet indeed you will find, that Char: Maintayned [Part. 1.
Chap: 6. N. 8.) Where he gives the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Faith, doth not ſo much as
mention Prudence.</p>
            <p n="89">89. But what do you anſwer to the argument of Char:
Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, (Chap: .6 N. 32.) That the Faith of Proteſtants being
<hi>imprudent and rash, cannot proceed from Divine motion and grace.</hi>
Nothing, but that <hi>by this reaſon all they that believe our Religion, and
cannot give a wiſe and ſufficient reaſon for it, muſt be condemned to
have no ſupernaturall Faith.</hi> Thus you, (Pag 381. N. 74.) which is
nothing to our purpoſe. For we ſpeak not of ability, to explicate or
declare to others the reaſon of our belief, which belongs to gratias gratis
datas, but of gratia gratum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciente, or prudence in order to the accepting
Faith for ourſelves, which hath a great latitude, and that which to one may
be prudent, would not be ſo to another, indued with more knowledg naturall,
or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, God judging of every one according to his particular
diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and readiness to embrace the object of Faith in the meaſure
of vnderſtanding communicated to him. But if indeed, all thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
we ſuppoſe him to proceed imprudently, his aſſent ſhall not be a true
Act of Faith, for the reaſons I a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>edgd, though ſuch an aſſent, wherby the ice is as it were
broken in order to ſuch an object, may Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate towards a true act of
Faith, when circumſtances being altered, a prudent judgment may take vp the
place of the former imprudent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and ſo God concurr with his
Grace to a true aſſent of Faith. Neither doth it import, that he who
proceeds imprudently, cannot diſcover in himſelf any difference between a
prudent, and imprudent aſſent; becauſe in theſe hidden intellectuall
acts, we muſt proceed by Reaſon, not by experience; as when a Paſtor or
Prelate propoſes to his ſubject two objects as matters of Faith, wherof one
is indeed revealed, the other not; the ſubject with equall prudence
aſſents to both, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out experiencing any difference in thoſe
aſſents, and yet that which <pb n="102" facs="tcp:59214:60"/>reſpects the object not
truly revealed, cannot be an act of Faith, but the other may be ſuch. And by
this is anſwerd what you have (Pag: 331. N. 10.) of this ſame poynt.</p>
            <p n="90">90. But now, that the Faith, even of your moſt ſelect
believers is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, appeares by your owne Principle, that, certainty in
aſſent cannot be without proportionable evidence in the Object. and yet you
ſay, they have certainty beyond evidence. Therfor they have a Faith in an
impoſſible manner, and ſo are imprudent in an eminent degree.</p>
            <p n="91">91. Your common probable Faith to be imprudent, I have
proved hertofore, becauſe it being only probable, yet you prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to preferr
it be fore any reaſon to the contrary, though ſeeming never ſo certain
and convincinge, which certaine is againſt all reaſon. Therfor your Faith
is imprudent; and ſeing you hold it to be prudent the concluſion muſt be,
that it is prudent, imprudent.</p>
            <p n="92">92. Before I leave this poynt, I muſt aske you two little
queſtions or Doubts. Firſt; what you meane in theſe words: <hi>Though all
that are truly wiſe,) that is, wiſe for eternity) will believe aright, yet
many may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve aright which are not wiſe.</hi> If they be truly wiſe who
are wiſe for eternity, and whoſoever believe aright, are wiſe for
eternity, (for as much as concernes their belief) we muſt conclude, that all
who believe aright, are truly wiſe; How ſay you then that many who believe
aright, are not wiſe. Secondly, I reflect a little on your words (Pag: 381.
N. 74.) <hi>I have proved the Faith of Proteſtants as certaine and as prudent
as the Faith of Papiſts; and therfore if theſe be certain groundes of
ſupernaturality, our Faith may have it as well as yours.</hi> But I beſeech
you, where did <hi>Cha: Maintayned</hi> ſay, that certainty and prudence are
grounds of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality? He ſayd only, that, if Faith be <hi>imprudent
and rash, it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Divine Motion and grace.</hi> Is it all one
to ſay, if an Action be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it muſt be ſupernaturall [which if it
be taken in generall, is falſe, ſince an action may be prudent, and not
ſupernaturall] and; it cannot be ſupernaturall if it be not prudent? What
Logick teaches an vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Affirmative Propoſition to be ſimply
converted, and from this, All ſupernaturall Acts are prudent, to inferr;
Therfor all prudent Acts are ſupernaturall: juſt as we have heard you
ſaying. (Pag: 331. N. 10.) <hi>All Aſtronomers are men, but all men are not
Aſtronomers.</hi> But it is more than tyme that I goe forward.</p>
            <p n="93">93. Fiftly: you calumniate our Faith, as a naturall and
ſupernaturall vnnaturall Aſſent. I anſwer, Our Faith is
ſupernaturall, not naturall <pb n="103" facs="tcp:59214:60"/>or vnnaturall (though I
wiſh you had explicated what you meane by vnnaturall) becauſe we acknowledg
it to be Donum Dei, the Gift of God. But your faith is indeed naturall, being
but a probable Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion evidently deduced from evident probable
Premiſes, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared hertofore; and yet in words you pretend that it
is ſupernaturall, [Pag. 409. §] <hi>And though;</hi> where you ſeeke
to vindicate yourſelf from being guilty of taking away ſupernaturall Faith;
and (Pag: 325. N. 2.) where you will ſeeme to admitt the neceſſity of a
ſupernaturall belief; though in truth you do not, but with Socinians deny
that our Sauiour hath merited any thing for mankind, and ſo we receive no
Grace by Chriſt; which was that which the Holy Fathers, and Generall
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles did deteſt and condemne in wicked Pelagians Wherby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
that your Faith is indeed naturall and yet being pretended to be
ſupernaturall, comes to be naturall, and ſupernaturall. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I
pray you remember, what I obſerved above, concerning an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Faith of
yours. (Pag: 329, and 330. N. 7.) acquired and infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which is in effect
naturall, and ſupernaturall. I muſt therfor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that not our, but
your Faith is a free, neceſſitated; certain, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine; evident,
obſcure; prudent and foliſh; naturall, and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall aſſent.</p>
            <p n="94">94. Object: 6. [Pag: 37. N. 9.] <hi>As nothing availes with
God but faith which worketh by loue: ſo any faith, if it be but as a graine
of muſt araſeed, if it worke by love, shall certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y availe with him, and be accepted of him.</hi>
Therfor a faith abſolutely certaine is not neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="95">95. Anſwer. Firſt: To worke by love, is to keepe Gods
Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, of which one is, that we believe as we ought. And for you to
ſuppoſe, that we believe as we ought, by a faith only probable, is a meer
begging of the Queſtion which you ſhould prove. For, although we ſhould
ſuppoſe that God had commanded no works at all, (as we diſtinguiſh
works from Faith) yet there would remayne a moſt ſtrict command, vnder
payne of damnation, to believe whatſoever is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed as a
truth revealed by God, with an Aſſent proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the Supreme
Authority, and above all other Aſſents, that is, with an infallible and
immoveable Aſſent. And indeed of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Faith, we may truly
ſay; 
<q rend="margQuotes">This is the firſt Commandement;</q> the
performance wherof is the firſt ſtep to all merit, Obedience, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
And as in the eating of the forbidden Apple, though the matter in it ſelf
might ſeeme ſmall, yet the tranſgreſſion was a grievous ſinne, 
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59214:61"/>becauſe that command was impoſed by God to teſtify
his Supreme Dominion over man; ſo this Precept of Faith, exacting the
Obedience of our vnderſtanding, which is the firſt Power of our ſoule,
doth of it ſelfe oblige in a moſt ſevere manner, even abſtracting from
all further works proceeding from the will by direction of the vnderſtanding
by Faith. For, God is Lord of our vnderſtanding, and exacts obedience of it,
no less than of our will.</p>
            <p n="96">96. Secondly, what you ſay of faith, if it be but as a
grain of muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardſeed; is both impertinent, and againſt yourſelf. For,
as I noted already, thoſe Texts of Holy Scripture clearly ſpeake of Faith
of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as of removing a mountaine into the ſea; and not of
Chriſtian Faith neceſſary to ſalvation. Neither by a faith like to a
graine of muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardſeed, is vnderſtood a weake, probable, and fallible
faith, like yours, but rather a very great and effectuall belief, able to
remove mountaynes, and trees, as appeares [Matt: 17.20. Luc: 17.6.] And S.
Paule [1. Cor: 13.] ſhewes, that this faith of Miracles is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
ſaying, 
<q rend="margQuotes">If I ſhould have all faith, ſo that I
could remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines &amp;c:</q> And our Saviour declares that it is firme
and certaine, (Matth: 21. V. 21.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">If you ſhall have faith, and ſtagger
not, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of the figtree ſhall you doe, but and if you ſhall
ſay to this mountaine, Take vp and throw thy ſelf into the ſea, it
ſhall be done. And (Matt: 13. V. 31.32.) The Kingdome of Heaven is like to a
muſtardſeed, which a man tooke and ſowed in his field. Which is the
leaſt ſurely of all ſeeds: but when it is growen, it is greater then all
hearbs, and is made a tree, ſo that the foules of the aire come, and dwell in
the branches therof.</q> Where, learned interpreters ſay, that, A muſtard
ſeed, eſpecially in Syria, growes to be a tree, ſo that the birds of the
ayre do dwell in the branches therof. This ſhewes, that as faith is compared
to a graine of muſtardſeed, becauſe it is little to ſight, ſo alſo
it is compared to it for Vigour, Vertue, Acrimony and Strength, and in no
wiſe for Weakness, or any ſimilitude with your fallible belief. Which yet
appeares more cleare, by the demand of the Apoſtles, (Matth: 17. V. 8.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Why could we not caſt him out?</q> And
our Saviours anſwer N. 19. by reaſon of your incredulity; and then brings
that ſimilitude of a muſtardſeed, as contrapoſed to their faith which
was but little: and ſo the Arabicus hath, propter parvitatem ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei
veſtrae, by reaſon of the littleness of your faith. But it cannot be
doubted that the Apoſtles had ſome faith, as you pretend to have, 
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59214:61"/>otherwiſe they would not have attempted to caſt out
the Divel; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the Faith which our Saviour compareth to a muſtardſeed,
and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to theirs, muſt be great and ſtrong in it ſelfe, though
ſmall in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, or litle in compariſon of ſome higher degree of
Faith. All which confutes your fallible faith, and ſhews not only that you
bring this example of a graine of muſtardſeed impertinently, but alſo
that it makes clearly againſt yourſelf, even though it were vnderſtood of
Faith neceſſary to ſalvation; in as much as it ſignifyes a great
ſtrength of Faith, as farr different from your Faith, as Certainty is
diſtinguiſhed from meer Probability. Beſides I pray you conſider, that
Faith of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rakles, is not that Faith which workes by love, and ſo according
to your owne words, cannot avayle with God, and can avayle with Men only to

Arguments are, wherby you would proue, that a weake Faith is ſufficient for

inſufficient. This Anſwer ſerves for your other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Him that
cryed, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Lord I believe, help my incredulity.</q> [Mar. 9.24.] Where it

by Loue, and fulfill other commandements; which you cannot deny, who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
Charity by Faith, as the effect is meaſured by the cauſe, and as you ſay,
(Pag. 326. Nꝰ 4.) <hi>Seing, as S. Iohn aſſures vs, our Faith is the
victory which overcomes the world, if the Faith of all true believers were
perfect, then their victory over the world and over ſinne, muſt of
necesſity be perfect:</hi> Much more we muſt ſay, according to your
ground; ſeing Faith is the victory which overcomes the world, if your Faith
be not ſufficient for ſalvation, your victory over the world and ſinne
cannot be ſufficient for that end. This according to your principles.</p>
            <p n="98">98. But in true Divinity, I ſay; ſeing God hath ſo
ordained, that Faith ſhould be the roote and beginning of all Obedience, and
Merit, if it ſelf be not a Faith ſufficient for ſalvation, how ſhall it
be the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Obedience or keeping all the other Commandements? God
proceeds with order, and gives not Charity, where he finds not Faith. I proved
in the Introduction, that the Commandements are not kept without Gods
particular efficacious Grace, which will not conſtantly be given to him who
wants true Chriſtian Faith. Nay, if juſtifying <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59214:62"/>Grace
be neceſſary for keeping the Commandements for long tyme (as I proved
there) much more true Faith muſt be required to doe it. Morover, beſides
our obligation to keepe the morall law, or of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there are precepts
binding vs to the exerciſe of ſupernaturall Acts of infuſed vertues; for
example, Hope, and Charity: and how ſhall our will exerciſe ſupernaturall
Acts, without a proportionable ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall direction in our
vnderſtanding? And if the direction be ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall it cannot be
erroneous, but infallibly true, and eſſentially different from your
fallible aſſent, as I have bene forced often to repeate. But why do I
endeavour to prove this poynt? I cannot doubt but if you did believe that
Chriſtian Faith neceſſary to ſalvation, muſt be in it ſelfe
infallible, by the particular precept of faith, you would not ſay, a Faith
only probable could be ſufficient to worke by Love, and keepe the other
Commandements. For, if it be ſuppoſed; not, be a true Faith, how can it
worke by Love, or live, it ſelfe being more than dead, that is, an Aſſent
which never lived the life, or nature, or eſſence of divine Faith. Surely,
if a Faith believed to be infallible, doth not reſtrayne the wills and
Paſſions of men, what liberty would they take, if their thoughts could tell
them, that Chriſtian Religion may prove not true, as in your doctrine it
may?</p>
            <p n="99">99. Object: 7. (Pag. 37. N. 9.) <hi>Some experience makes

            <p n="101">101. But above all, who can indure your ſaying, that

to prove, that ſuch a faith is ſufficient to ſalvation? I appeale to the
conſcience of every Chriſtian, whether he fynds not in his ſoule, an
aſſent to what he reads in Holy Scripture, farr different, and of another
kind, and higher nature, and greater ſtrength, than the credit he gives to
other ſtoryes. If your <hi>conſidering and diſcourſing men,</hi> have
not ſuch a feeling of Scripture, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, they are no
Chriſtians; nor ought we to forbeare, the declaring how neceſſary
infallible Faith is, for any panicall feare of this Phariſaicall ſcandall.
Rather, we are obliged to declare the truth, leaſt we become acceſſary to
their perdition, which none can avoyd who deny the certainty of Chriſtian
Faith and Religion, and reſt in the falſe confidence of fallible probable
faith, of the ſame kind with the <hi>belief</hi> which <hi>they give to the

Concluſion followes the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Premiſe, but I did not imagine (as I
touched hertofore) you would ſo farr betray yourſelfe, as to hold, that, If
one have probable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to believe that ſome Man did teſtify a truth,
and have equall Motives that God reveales, or witneſſerh the ſame thing,
his aſſent to that truth, as it is witneſſed by God, is not greater
than his belief therof, as it is witneſſed by man, if the Reaſons for
which I believe it is witneſſed by God, and by Man, be of equall
ſtrength; and yet you muſt ſay ſo, if with your conſidering men, you
believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Goſpell of Chriſt with the ſame kind of belief
which they give to the truth of other ſtoryes. Wherin I confess you would 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59214:63"/>doe, as all Heretiques are wont, pass from ill, to
worſe. For, [Pag: 141. N. 27.] you ſay: <hi>For the incorruption of
Scripture, I know no other rationall aſſurance we can have of it, then
ſuch as we have of the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of other ancient Bookes, that is, the
conſent of ancient Copyes: ſuch I meane for the kind, though it be farr
greater for the degree of it.</hi> And [Pag: 62. N. 24.] ſpeaking alſo of
the incorruption of Scripture, you ſay: <hi>I know no other meanes to be
aſſured herof, than I have that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Book is incorrupted. For, though
I have a greater degree of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall and humane Aſsurance of that than this,
in regard of divers conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations which make it more credible, That the
Scripture hath bene preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from any materiall alteration; yet my

aſſurances, and neither Phyſicall or Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall.</hi> But now you are
very carefull, that the faith of conſidering men, be not crackt by too much
ſtraining, but be left to believe the Goſpell of Chriſt with ſuch a
kind of aſſent as they yeald to other matters of tradition, and is
vndiſcernable from the belief they give to the truth of other ſtoryes.
Vnhappy men, who relying on their conſidering, and diſcourſing, forget,
that Chriſtian Faith is a Gift in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by the Holy Ghoſt, and not to be
meaſured by meere humane Motives, or Rules of logick. I will not looſe tyme
in telling you, that a thing may be crack't by too much ſtrayning, not only
by excess, (as you vnjuſtly accuſe vs) but alſo by way of Defect, ſuch
as your weake faith is in order to the true ſaving Faith of Chriſtians,
which being reduced to probability, looſeth its very Eſſence and

Belief; and ſo be able to beare downe all gay probabilityes of humane

millions in the world forgoe many tymes their preſent eaſe and pleaſure,
vndergoe great and toyiſome labours, encounter <pb n="110" facs="tcp:59214:64"/>great

and that not infinite and eternall, but finite and temporall? Who ſees not,
that many men abſtaine from many things they exceedingly deſire, not vpon
any certaine aſsurance, but a probable feare of danger that may come after?
What man ever was there ſo madly in love with a preſent pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that he
would willingly ſpend it vpon a little hope that by doing ſo be might gaine
a hundred thouſand pound! and I would faine know what gay probabilityes you

deviſe none, what reaſon then or ſence is there, but that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
hope of infinite and eternall happyness provided for all thoſe that obey
Chriſt Ieſus, and much more a firme faith, though not ſo certain, in
ſome fort, as ſenſe or ſcience, may be able to ſway our will to
obedience, and encounter with all thoſe temptations which Fleſh and Bloud
can ſuggeſt to avert vs from it? Men may therfor talke their pleaſure of

that obedience to Chriſt were the only way to preſent and eternall

            <p n="103">103. Anſwer. Firſt; when <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi>
wrote againſt <hi>D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who, with other Proteſtants, and

dreamed of any neceſſity to proue ſuch an infallibility; and therfor he
touched that point incident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not of purpoſe, as a thing
preſuppoſed, not to be proved. And therfor what you object againſt vs, is
to be anſwered by thoſe whom you call Brethren.</p>
            <p n="104">104. Secondly; I might ſpeedily and eaſily anſwer in
one word; That, your Objection doth not ſo much as touch the Argument of 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59214:64"/>
               <hi>Char: Maintayned,</hi> which was, that vnless Faith

may be ſufficient to ſway our will to obedience, in reſpect of other
Precepts concerning Workes or Manners: all which though we did grant, yet
ſuch a faith could not be ſufficient to ſalvation, which cannot be
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned without performance of the Precepts, both of living well, and
believing aright.</p>
            <p n="105">105. Thirdly; that a probable belief is not ſuch a faith
as we are commanded to haue, I haue proved already; and it is cleare enough of
it ſelf; if it be remembred, that we are obliged to belieue the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of
Chriſtian Faith, by an Aſſent immoveable, notwithſtanding whatſoever
temptations, impulſions, or reaſons to the contrary, which cannot
poſſibly agree to a probable aſſent. For, nothing but Certainty, can
produce an immobility in the vnderſtanding, and a prudent ſettled
reſolution never to alter for what reaſon ſoever: and to ſay the
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is to turne meere probability into abſolute certainty. What is
more vulgarly knowne than that Probability is eſſentially the roote of
feare leaſt the contrary may be true, and involves an aptitude to be
chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if better reaſon preſent it ſelfe. We may well compare
Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the vnderſtanding, with Paſſions in the Appetite, which
are a ſource of prepetuall motion. Actiue and Paſſiue, to moue, and to be
moved. Or it is like the humours in our body, which deſtroy it, and
themſelves. For, Probability by the feare it hath adjoyned, is ſtill in
actu primo, in a diſpoſition, and readness to deſtroy it ſelfe. And we
may ſay: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Qui ſibi nequam eſt cui bonus erit?
He that is wicked to himſelfe, to what other man will he be good?</q> If
Probability cannot conſerue it ſelfe, being left to it ſelfe; how will it
encounter with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall temptations, ariſing from the Divell, World,
Fleſh, Paſſions, feares, Hope, Loue, Averſion, Obſtinacy,
Animoſity, Puſillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Education, and the like? If you were to giue a
reaſon, of your ſo many changes in Religion, you muſt referr it to the
nature of Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which in reaſon muſt yield to better reaſon; and
ſo Preface [N. 5.] you profess that your conſtancy in Religion
conſiſted in <hi>following that way to Heaven which for the preſent
ſeemed moſt probable.</hi> And Pag: 303.] you ſay of yourſelf, that, of
<hi>a moderate Proteſtant you turned <pb n="102" facs="tcp:59214:65"/>Papiſt, and the
day that you did ſo, you were convicted in conſcience that your
yeſterdayes opinion was an errour: That afterward vpon better
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, you became a doubting Papiſt, and of a doubting Papiſt a

al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in Religion, than heer you ſpecify: as, that you paſſed the
ſecond tyme from Proteſtancy to vs; and how then were you a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
Proteſtant?) And in the ſame [N. 103. Pag: 304.] That you do not <hi>yield
your weakness altogeather without apology, ſeeing your deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were
rationall.</hi> Behold the ground of your alterations Rationall and probable

certainty. A fearfull ſtate, wherin one may, yea ought, at the houre of death
to chang his Religion, if ſeeming better reaſons, do then preſent
themſelves againſt, than he hath, for, it! wherby he may come to dy of no
Religion at all. Socinians are wont to talk much of Reaſon, of conſidering
and diſcourſing men. But alas, what elſe is Reaſon, or conſideration,
or Diſcourſe, deſtitute of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to God by an infallible
Aſſent, except a perpetuall and inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant offer, or a temptation, to
alter their faith, and pull downe their former Religion, before they haue tyme
to build, or reſolue of a new one. Beſides, Chriſtian Faith being
obſcure, and evidence the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall center of our vnderſtanding (without
which, it is like a ſtone vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently held from falling) no wonder if the
ſtrength of Certainty be neceſſary, to beare vs vp, aboue the inclination
we haue to be placed in the center and light of Evidence; wherby it falls out,
that humane reaſons againſt Faith, being connaturall, and as it were levell
with our vnderſtanding, are eaſily and eagerly accepted; eſpecially
ſince the Myſteryes of Chriſtian Faith ſeeme contrary to Reaſon,
becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are aboue it.</p>

of your probable faith, which I haue proved to be only ſtrength of nature,
how weake and changeable muſt it be? If Holy Iob could ſay of Man, 
<q rend="margQuotes">nunquam in eodem ſtatu permanet, he
neuer remaynes in the ſame ſtate:</q> Iob 14. V. 2.] much more may we ſay
the ſame of the weakeſt belief in the ſoule of man, which is meere
probability, produced by the only forces of him who never remaines in the
ſame ſtate, Lamentable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath taught vs, how many of great witts,
yea of zeale, and piety, who ſtood as Cedars of Libanus, and ſhined like
beacons to enlighten others, haue fallen into damnable, and ſomtymes, even 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59214:65"/>fooliſh Hereſyes, though once they believed the
contrary Truths, and Articles of our Faith, with abſolute certainty: Such is
the imbecillity of nature; And then what can be expected of a belief, which
expreſly tells it ſelf, that it is not certaine; and which believes no
poynt of faith with certainty, except that Faith it ſelf is not certaine?
Holy Scripture aſſures vs, that, 
<q rend="margQuotes">he who loves danger, ſhall periſh
therin.</q> [Eccli: 3. V. 27.] It is in every mans power by Divine
aſſiſtance, to arrive to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine true belief, as I ſhewed even out
of <hi>Chillingworth</hi> himſelf; and this he is obliged to doe by the
immediate Precept of Faith, and by the obligation of Charity to ones ſelf,
which bindes vs to chooſe the ſafer part in a matter of ſo great moment;
and therfor let no man pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a probable Faith, and put
himſelf, not only in danger, but in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of periſhing by ſuch a
weake, probable, and changeable Aſſent.</p>
            <p n="107">107. And now I hope it appeares, that the Reaſon which
<hi>Chari: Maintayned</hi> gaue for the infallibility of Chriſtian Faith,
remaines very good, and ſolide, though delivered by him incidently, not
imagining that any would call in queſtion the certainty of Chriſtian Faith
againſt <hi>D. Potter,</hi> who expreſſly avouches it, and againſt all
Proteſtants. As well might it haue beene expected of <hi>Char:

ſinners in Hell, or any other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Chriſtian belief, common to
Catholiques and Proteſtants, as this truth, that Chriſtian Faith is
certainly true. The truth is, that <hi>Chill:</hi> doth ſo farr diſſent
from Proteſtants, that I cannot be thought to write againſt him, or to
confute any defenſe he makes for <hi>Potter,</hi> but to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a new

other Proteſtants will profess to deteſt: and it were no wonder, arguments
ſhould chance not to hitt that mark, at which they never ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, nor confute
thoſe, againſt whom they were never intended. Yet in fact this argument
which heer you impugne, doth rightly proue the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of an infallible
certaine Faith, as I haue ſhewed; as alſo that your Objection and endeavour
to proue, that a fallible Faith is ſufficient for the exerciſe of good
workes, is nothing to the purpoſe, ſince <hi>Char: Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> ſpoke
of ſufficiency to obſerue the precepts of Faith, and if you belieue S. Iohn
Chryſoſtome cited aboue, that according to S. Paule it is a harder matter
to belieue the high myſteries of our Faith, than to exerciſe good workes,
you will eaſily inferr, that although you could <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59214:66"/>proue a
probable Faith to be ſufficient in order to Obedience, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of good
workes, yet it would not therfor remaine proved to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for
believing, as we ought. And S. Chryſoſtome ſaying, that it is ſo hard a

            <p n="108">108. Fourthly, I ſay, That although the words of
<hi>Char: Maintayned,</hi> be taken in the ſenſe, which you would put vpon
them, yet your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of no force to confute them, or to prove that a
fallible Faith is able to overcome our will, 
<q rend="margQuotes">a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d encounter with humane probabilityes,
backed with the ſtrength of fleſh and bloud.</q> And; Firſt I muſt
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, not to coſen your Reader as a Miniſter foold his Auditours,
who after he had ſpoken much of Gods Commandements, in the cloſe of his
diſcourſe, deſired not to be miſtaken, as if he belieued that thoſe
Commandements, of which he had ſpoken, could be kept; for, it was very
certaine they could not: which if he had told them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he might
haue ſpared his owne paynes, and the exerciſe of their patience in hearing
his prating, and prayſing an impoſſible thing. Our Saviour ſayd; if
thou wilt enter into life, keepe the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: (Matth: 19.17.) Theſe men
tell vs; if thou wilt enter into life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue firmily as a matter of Faith,
that thou canſt not keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. But to our purpoſe: leaſt
<hi>Mr Chilling,</hi> looſe his labour, and deceaue his Hearers, I muſt
beſeech him to deale plainly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he goes about to moue their wills,
he would in forme their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings by letting them know; that he is to
ſpeake of infinite and eternall happyness, provided for all thoſe that obey
Chriſt Ieſus: and of vnſpeakeable, eternall torments to be inflicted on
all ſuch as break his commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; but withall he muſt aſſure them,
that although both Papiſts and Proteſtants teach, that all muſt belieue
with abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, there is a Heauen, a Hell, Eternall rewards, and
puniſhments; a Sauiour, a Reſurection, working of miracles, and the like,
yet that with men conſidering, diſcourſing, and vſing <hi>rationall
deductions, according to the never failing rules of Logick</hi> (which are his
words in ſeverall parts of his Booke) ſuch as He, and his fellowes are; the
matter paſſeth farr otherwiſe. For they belieue, that the teaching a
neceſſity of ſuch a certaine Faith, is a <hi>Doctrine moſt
preſumptuous and vncharitable.</hi> (Pag. 328. N. 6.) <hi>and a greate
errour, and of dangerous and pernicious conſequence</hi> (Pag. 325. N. 3) And
that indeed the Articles which all Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue. may (for ought they
know Certainly to the contrary) in the end <pb n="115" facs="tcp:59214:66"/>proue falſe,
and no better than dreames. Thus I muſt intreate him to prepare his
Auditours, and then let vs heare how he will goe about to perſwade, yea
oblige them vnder payne of eternall damnation, to the obſervance of things
moſt difficult, and repugnant to humane princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, naturall inclinations,
fleſh and bloud, ſelf-loue, and in a word, which are 
<q rend="margQuotes">To the Gentils, fooliſhness; to the

Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare him, preaching rather, than prouing in the words which I

would giue dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent anſwers. Perhaps ſome, hearing from others your ſo
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny changes of Religion, and from your ſelf, that your preſent belief is
but probable; they would take tyme for tryall, how long you would perſever in
your ſect, of a late Date for tyme, and ſtrange for the nouelty, as being
contrary both to Proteſtans, with whom you liued ſo long tyme, and
againſt Catholiques, to whom you joynd your ſelfe, not by any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, (for
who, or what, except evidence of truth, could force you to a Religion, lying
vnder the burthen of a long, and cruell perſecution?) but vpon due
conſideration of Reaſons on all ſides, and not taking things at a
ſecond hand, or vpon credit, but by examination made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly by your
ſelfe, or by conference with others, who gaue you all freedom, and
encouragement to propoſe your difficultyes. And for this their delay in
reſolvinge, they might perhaps make vſe of a ſaying of your owne, Pag:
(330. N. 7. <hi>He who requires, that I should ſee things farther than they
are viſible, requires I should ſee ſomething inviſible,</hi> and apply
it to this ſenſe: That you, who flitted from a Faith, which you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
then to be certaine, to a belief confeſſedly not certaine, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
others to do the ſame, may in tyme paſſe from a non-certainty, to a
non-entity, or non-exiſtence of all Faith, and ſo by degrees bring your
proſelytes to plaine infidelity.</p>
            <p n="110">110. Others will anſwer; That indeed if men were once
infaliibly certaine, of the great promiſes, and threats you mention, of
Heaven, Hell, Reſurrection from death &amp;c. They could excogitate no
ſatisfying reaſon, to avoide Obedience, and keeping the commandements: Yet
while we ſuppoſe them to be deliberating about the election of their Faith,
and actually enjoying, or in a way, or poſſibility, and freedom to enjoy
things of profit, and pleaſure in this world, which are preſent 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59214:67"/>and certaine, and proportionable to their naturall
inclinations, and powers of Body a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſoule, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare you telling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that no Religion is certaine, and talking of things to come; a farr of; and in
another world which to humane reaſon, not aſſiſted by certainty of
Faith, looke like the <hi>ſpatia imaginaria</hi> before the world was
created; you ought not to wonder, if (notwithſtanding all the fayre words in
your Objection) men would be apt to pleade, the poſſeſſion of their
Freedom, and liberty, which they will not eaſily bring vnder ſo ſtrict
obligation, and ſeeming heauy yoke, meerly vpon a belief, concerning which
your ſelfe profess to have only this certainty, that it is not certaine.
Chriſtians firmely belieue by Faith, know evidently by reaſon, ſee dayly
by experience, that dye they muſt, they heare all men ſay, and themſelves
belieue, Death to be Omnium terribilium terribiliſſimum, the moſt
dreadfull of all dreadfull things, and yet we ſee, they more apprehend the
danger of wetting their cloathes, by a gentle ſhower threatned inſtantly to
fall, than death it ſelfe. And why? becauſe the one is apprehended as
almoſt preſent, the other is looked on as farr of for ſpace of tyme, as
the vaſt body of the ſun ſeemes to be a ſmall thing, by the great
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of place. Beſides, divine and ſupernaturall Objects, hold ſo
great disproportion with humane Reaſon, and contrariety with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
inclinations, that they appeare either hard, or impoſſible, and no more
apprehenſible by poſſeſſion, than comprehenſible by reaſon. I
beſeech you, tell me ſincerely, what you thinke would haue been the Success
of S. Paules preaching, to the Athenians againſt their falſe Gods, and for
the true Meſſias, and Reſurrection of the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he had told them
clearly, that they could haue no certainty of thoſe, or any other Myſteryes
of Chriſtianity?</p>
            <p n="111">111. Vpon theſe grounds it appeares, that your
Objections are of no force; and in particular that which you did propoſe as
vnanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>What man</hi> ſay you, <hi>was there ever ſo madly in
loue with a preſent penny, but that he would willingly ſpend it vpon any
litle hope that by doyng ſo, he might gaine an hundred thouſand
pround?</hi> This, I ſay, proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, becauſe as you nakedly
deliver it, it proves too much, and yourſelf, and all Proteſtants, and all
Chriſtians muſt anſwer it, as being manifeſtly repugnant to the
experience of all men, who ſurely find greater difficulty (naturally
ſpeaking) to keepe the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to forgive, and do good to their
deadly enemyes, to ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, to beare their Cross, to deny
themſelves &amp;c. then they could <pb n="117" facs="tcp:59214:67"/>even poſſibly
find in ſpending a ſingle penny, in the caſe you propoſe, deveſted of
any accidentall difficulty, or aggravating circumſtance, only conſidering
the diſproportion betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a penny, and ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, which is
ſo vaſt and evident to ſenſe and reaſon, that the will remaynes
determined, and in a manner neceſſitated to giue ſo litle, for ſo much;
and a man greedy of gaine, would in ſome ſort find as great difficulty in
ſuch a caſe, not to giue a penny for ſo many pounds, as to giue ſo many
pounds for a penny, which, in reſpect of thoſe thouſands, lookes like
nothing compared to ſomething. But the difference betweene earthly, and
heavenly things, though it be in it ſelfe incomparably greater, than any
diſproportion can be conceyved betweene worldly objects compared amongſt
themſelves, yet to vs it appeares not with evidence to be ſo, and therfore
our vnderſtanding and will, need the ſupport, and certainty of a high, and
Divine ranke, to ſupply the evidence of reaſon, or ſenſe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
reſiſt all kind of temptations. For which cauſe, Faith is called the
ſubſtance of things hoped for, and an Argument of things not ſeene: which
therfor in order to vs, who by nature are ſtrangers to myſteryes ſo
ſublime, muſt receyue being, exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and ſubſiſtence, from a
firme and certaine belief And now Sir, is it indeed as eaſy to keepe the
commandements (which many of thoſe whom you call Brethren, hold impoſſble
to be kept, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes belieue it cannot be done, without Gods ſpeciall
Grace) as it is to ſpend a penny for gayning ſo many pounds becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe our
Saviour hath ſo revealed, that to giue a cup of could water [which is not
worth a penny for his ſake, ſhall not want a reward i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater, not only than millions of
pounds, but of millions of worlds, and yet we ſee, men are not ſo liberall
to the poore, as they muſt needs be, if your objection were of force, and
that there were the ſame proportion, betweene earthly and heavenly things, as
there is between earthly things, compared with one another. If keeping the
Commandements be as eaſy as to ſpend a penny for gaining thouſands of
pounds, how comes it, that ſo few keepe, and ſo many breake them, which
ſcarcely any Chriſtian would, yea in ſome ſenſe, could do, if your
caſe did hold no less in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>earthly? How could the
ſpeciall Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, be neceſſary for keeping the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements (as in the introduction we ſhewed, if it be as eaſy to keepe
them, as to ſpend a penny, for gayning thousands of pounds? How co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes that
pious woman in the Goſpell to be ſo highly commended by God incarnate, for
offering a mite, if it be ſo very eaſy to forgoe things 
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59214:68"/>preſent, vpon hope of a reward after this life?.</p>
            <p n="112">112, But let vs alter your caſe a litle, and veſt it
with ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumſtances; For example, that you had but one, or
very few pence, and apprehended them to be neceſſary for preſent
expences, [as worldly men conceyue all they haue, to be too litle for their
occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions] that your life, or health depended on it, as <hi>Eſau</hi>
apprehended of the meaſe of potage, for which he ſold his inheritance; that
it muſt not be given once only, but every day and hower, as it happens in our
endeavour to keepe the Commandements: 
<q rend="margQuotes">For, The life of man vpon earth is a
warfare,</q> [Iob, 7.1.] let vs, I ſay, confider your caſe, with theſe or
the like, circumſtances, and then anſwer whether it would appeare ſo
eaſy as you made it? Or can you proue by it ſo ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that any faith,
or any hope will ſerue to keepe the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are hard to fleſh
and bloud; which muſt continually be kept; and therfore require an
inceſſant Vigilancy and ſolicitude; which oblige vs to looſe fortunes,
health, and life rather then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt any one ſin? You cannot but ſee the
weakness of your Argument, and the neceſſity yourſelfe, and all
Chriſtians haue to anſwer it.</p>
            <p n="113">113. But there remaynes yet an Argument of higher
conſideration, againſt you who diſcourſe like yourſelfe, that is, a
Socinian and Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian, as if the Commandements could be kept by the
ſtrength, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of reaſon alone; or, as if the will could of it
ſelfe performe, or avoyde whatſoever the vnderſtanding dictates to be
performed or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded, without particular Grace, conferred for the ſacred
Merits of our Bleſſed Saviour; which is a Luciferian pride evacuating the
fruite of his life and Death: Wheras all Orthodox Chriſtians, who belieue the
ſpeciall Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, to be neceſſary for true Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
are therby aſſured, that the will hath not of it ſelfe force to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
or fly whatſoever the vnderſtanding propoſes to be embraced, or avoyded;
and conſequently it is no good Argument: The vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding directs vs to
do this, Therfor our will may do it without the particular Grace of God; which
if it be neceſſary to the will for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, it muſt alſo be
neceſſary in the vnderſtanding for Believing with a ſupernaturall
Divine Aſſent, without which, God doth not giue Grace to the will, for
keeping the Commandements; which holds particularly in your Principle, that
Faith is the cauſe of Charity, and then if the effect be aboue the force of
nature, much more the cauſe muſt be ſo. Morover, if Faith be but
probable, and conſequently only <pb n="119" facs="tcp:59214:68"/>naturall (which
ſequele I haue proved aboue) it cannot be a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable meanes to
ſupernaturall Eternall Happyneſſe; and ſo you muſt hold, that even
the Beatificall Viſion is but naturall: which if it be; how will you moue men
with your ſpecious, but empty, words, to keepe hard wayes, [Pſam: 16. V.
4.] for an End meerly naturall and proportioned to a probable and changeable
faith, which may proue falſe, and the Beatude which it propoſe, a Fiction,
and Nothing.</p>
            <p n="114">114. Wheras you ſay: who ſees not, that many millyons
in the world <hi>forgoe many tymes their preſent eaſe and pleaſure,
vndergoe great and toyleſome labours &amp;c: vpon a probable hope of ſome
future gaine and commodity?</hi> I anſwer, as aboue, that ſuch gaines are
of the ſame kind with the labours and paynes: I meane, they are all naturall
thinges, and neither aboue the forces of our vnderſtanding to apprehended,
nor of our will to deſire and embrace, but connaturall, and in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
vſe amongſt men, who haue not much difficulty to doe what they ſee done
by others, and done by inſtinct, and command of nature. For, if we ſift
into the roote of ſuch toyles, labours, and adventures as you ſpeake of, we
ſhall find it to be that innate and inbred deſire, which every creature
hath to conſerue it ſelfe in Being, actuated by ſuch meanes and
induſtryes, as it is beſt able to lay hold on. If <hi>to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe eaſe and
pleaſure; and vndergoe great and toyleſome labours, and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon
great dangers,</hi> be apprehended neceſſary for the ſayd end, it is no
wonder, if they be embraced as less evills; which is no more than we ſee in
irrationall creatures. And, to affirme, that it is as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to keepe the
Commandements, and obey the Goſpell of Chriſt our Lord, as to performe
Actions proceeding from the common inſtinct of Nature, is moſt injurious to
the Grace, and Merits of our Bleſſed Saviour. And yet, even in this, your
Objection, vpon due reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, makes for vs againſt yourſelf: becauſe
the common inſtinct of Nature to preſerue it ſelfe, is a thing Certaine
and invariable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God the Author of nature, and is the ground of
that moſt reaſonable and certaine Axiome, that it is lawfull to reſiſt
force with force. In which Reſpect, he is not guilty of murther who did no
more, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was neceſſary for his owne defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe: according to which
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, your Argument proves, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith neceſſary for all
Chriſtians, and which is the Roote of all Piety, Iuſtice, and Salvation,
muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, certaine, and invariable, as is the common Inſtinct of
nature, or Roote of all endeavours of creatures to preſerue their being.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59214:69"/>
            <p n="115">115. I hope your Objection is fully anſwered by the
former conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. Now I muſt aske with what ingenuity can you ſay
of your Adverſary: <hi>He that requires to true Faith an abſolute certainty
for this only Reaſon, becauſe any less degree could not be able to overcome
our will,</hi> &amp;c. Since he ſayes no ſuch thing, as, that that was the
only Reaſon, which might be given to proue the ſayd Truth; for he gaue that
only incidently, not excluding others, and you ſee I haue given many more,
and amongſt the reſt, that there is an obligation to belieue with an
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſupernaturall Aſſent, abſtracting from any relation to good
works, or victory ouer our will and affections: And therfore that only, is only
your owne fiction.</p>
            <p n="116">116. I need not anſwer your examples, of believing,
there is ſuch a Citty as Conſtantinople, of giving credit to Caeſars
Commentaries, or Saluſts Hiſtory; which, beſide the impiety, are
impertinent; ſince I haue proued, that true Divine Faith being of a higher
ranke, is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, ſupernaturall, and not producible but by Gods Speciall
Grace. which Epithetons do not agree to the ſayd Examples; to omitt other
Reaſons alleadged hertofore. In the meane tyme, what a miſerable thing do
you make the Faith of Chriſtians, in being less ſtrong and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall,
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the belief of prophane ſtoryes. Wheras if the neceſſity of an
infallible Faith be once believed, men will ſeeke it, and by degrees of
Obedience ſhall by ſure to fynd it, even according to your owne
Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="117">117. Laſtly I will add; That, although it were
ſuppoſed, (but in no wiſe granted) that ſome particular perſon, in
ſome extraordinary circumſtances, might performe by a probable faith, all
that, of which you haue preached; yet ſince that would be but a rare, and
extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Caſe, and that the generality of mankind, would periſh for
want of an infallible, ſtedfaſt Faith; it were injurious to Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Providence, to imagine, that he gives not to the generality of men, Grace
ſufficient for ſuch a Belief. And this being once ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I ſay
further, that I muſt de facto take away the ſuppoſition which I made, and
affirme, that ſufficient Grace being denyed to none, and every one being
obliged to chooſe the ſafer part, in matters of this nature, the

               </gap>,
that every one is obliged vnder payne of damnation, to belieue the Articles of

            <p n="118">118. Which having been proved, by Scripture; Fathers; the

Hereſy; the neceſſity of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge all Faith and Religion, if Faith be
not infallible; the nature of Divine Chriſtian Faith; the Obedience it
implyes; the neceſſity of Gods ſpeciall Grace to produce it; the

his Arguments againſt it; the turning his owne Objections and Reaſons
againſt himſelf; his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and in a manner continuall contradictions;
his multiplyed changes of Religion, cauſed by this his Doctrine; the
infallibility of Faith, I ſay, having bene proved by theſe and other
convincing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; the next Demand will be, what meanes, Rule, or judge,
our Bleſſed Saviour hath left vs, on which this infallibility of Faith
muſt be grounded. And becauſe Proteſtants pretend to agree in no point,
more, than that Scripture alone is the ſole Rule of Faith, as contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
evidently all thinges neceſſary to be believed, the next Chapter ſhall be
imployed, in confutation of that aſſertion; that ſo, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, we may

ſeverall obligations, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Dutyes, as for Biſhops, Paſtours, Prieſts;
&amp;c: who, for example, are obliged to teach others, Ordaine Prieſts,
conficere, and adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sacraments &amp;c:</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, for every particular Perſon, or member of
the Church, ſome things are abſolutely neceſſary, in the judgment both
of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and Proteſtants; as v. g. Faith, True and Divine for
eſſence, and ſufficient for Extenſion for all points abſolutely
neceſſary to be expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed; and Repentance after deadly ſin
committed; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Catholiks, Baptiſme in Re for children, and in
Re, or Voto for Adulti; as alſo the Sacrament of Pennance, after the
committing of Actuall ſinne, if it be deadly; and finally the keeping, and
conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowing of the Commandements.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For explication of the word evident; I note, that, to
be contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned evidently in Scripture, may be vnderſtood in three manner of
wayes. Firſt, that ſome Poynt be contayned in particular, and ſo
evidently, that no man, who vnderſtands the language, can doubt what it
ſignifyes according to the vſuall ſignification of the word, and that in
ſuch a Text it is taken in ſuch a common ſignification, and not in ſome
figurative, or myſticall, or morall ſenſe, as divers tymes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens.
For if it be capable of ſuch a ſenſe, I muſt haue ſome certainty,
that it is not taken ſo, before I can ground vpon it an infallible Aſſent
of Faith; and therfor I muſt haue more than only probable (that is, ſome
certaine and infallible) meanes to know whether it be taken in the common
ſignification, or, if it haue more vſuall or common ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications than
one, in which of them it is taken. Which depending <pb n="124" facs="tcp:59214:71"/>on the
Free will of God, can be knowne only by Revelation, that is, according to
Proteſtants, by ſome other evident Text of Scripture, and ſo without end,
vnless they can find ſome Text, neceſſarily determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one only
ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Secondly: evident may ſignify, that ſome poynt be
indeed contayned in Scripture in it ſelfe, or in particular, but not ſo, as
to be vnderſtood clearly, and certainly by Vertue of the words taken alone,
without the help of ſome interpreter, to whom, if antecedently we giue
credit, that will become evident to vs by his interpretation, which before was
obſcure: as the words of the Prophet Iſay became evident to the Eunuch by
the Declaration of S. Philip, whom he tooke for a true interpreter. Act. 8. V.
35.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thirdly; A thing may be evident in Holy Scripture, not
in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or in it ſelfe; but in ſome generall Meanes, or Authority,
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly and clearly delivered, and recommended to vs by Scripture; which
being once believed, and accepted with a firme Aſſent, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſuch
a Meanes, or Authority, doth evidently propoſe, may be ſayd to be evidently
contayned in Scripture, not in it ſelfe, but in that generall Meanes,
expreſſly recommended by Scripture. In this manner S. Auguſtine
ſpeaking of Rebaptization of ſuch as were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Heretiques, ſayth
De vnitate Eccle: Cap: 22. 
<q rend="margQuotes">This is neither openly nor evidently
read, neither by you, nor by me: Yet if there were any wiſe man of whom our
Saviour had given teſtimony, and that he ſhould be conſulted in this
queſtion, we ſhould make no doubt to performe what he ſhould ſay,
leaſt we might ſeeme to gainſay not him ſo much as Chriſt, by whoſe
teſtimony he was recommended. Now Chriſt beareth witnes to his Church. And
a little after: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever refuſeth to follow the practiſe of the Church,
doth reſiſt our Saviour himſelfe, who, by his teſtimony, recommends the
Church. And Lib 1. cont. Creſcon: Cap: 32. &amp; 33. We follow indeed, in
this matter, even the moſt certaine authority of Canonicall Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. But
how? Conſider his words: Although verily there be brought no example for this
point out of Canonicall Scriptures, yet even in this point the truth of the
ſame Scriptures is held by vs, while we do that, which the authority of
Scriptures doth recommend, that ſo, becauſe the Holy Scripture cannot
deceiue vs, whoſoever is afrayd to be deceived by the obſcurity of this
queſtion, muſt haue recourſe to the ſame Church concerning it, which
without any ambiguity <pb n="125" facs="tcp:59214:71"/>the Holy Scripture doth
demonſtrate to vs.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. In one of theſe two latter ſenſes, Catholike
Authors may truly affirme, all things neceſſary to be evidently contaynd in
Scripture. But Proteſtants, who reject the infallibility of the Church,
muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it in the firſt ſenſe only, according to which, they
remayne obliged to a very hard taske of proving, Firſt; in generall, out of
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Scripture, that all things neceſſary to be believed, are evident
in Scripture; 2. of proving every particular Point of Faith out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
immediatly, or by certaine and cleare deductions from it, and not by topicall
Arguments of their owne fancy, which they will needs be calling or rather
miſcalling, Reaſon; 3. of proving every Point out of evident Scripture, and
ſo evident, that it be certaine the words de facto are not taken in ſome
ſenſe of which they are capable, different from their vſuall, common,
obvious, and, as I may ſay, moſt litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſignification, (as
Proteſtants interpret the words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.) For, ſince the
words concerning which the Queſtion ariſes, are ſtill the ſame, their
meaning muſt be taken from ſome other evident Text, as I ſayd aboue, and
ſo without end, vnleſſe they can alledge ſome words, which certainly
cannot be taken in any ſenſe but one, though of themſelves they be
capable of more; and though even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers chief learned Proteſtants teach,
that one Text of Scripture may haue diverſe litterall ſenſes. Nay, here
is not an end of their labours. For, ſince the word Evident, may be fitly
taken in three ſenſes, of which that only which I put in the firſt place,
is accepted by Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, they muſt proue by ſome Evident Text, that
all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary are evidently contayned in Scripture in that firſt
ſenſe, and by an evidence of the Text alone, without dependance, or
relation to any other thing, (for example, the Church, or Tradition) which
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, ſurely the Scripture never expreſſes. I beſeech the
Reader to conſider this, and mark to what an impoſſible taske
Proteſtants are engaged. Yet this is not all. It will ſtill remayne
doubtfull whether that Text which did ſay, that all things are evidently
contayned in Scripture, be vnderſtood vniverſally of all things
neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or only of things neceſſary to be believed,
and written: which if you wil needs haue to be all one, or of the ſame
extent, you begg the Queſtion, in ſuppoſing, that all things
neceſſary to be believed, are neceſſarily to be written in the Holy
Scripture.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Theſe reflections being premiſed about the
Meaning of the <pb n="126" facs="tcp:59214:72"/>words Neceſſary and Evident, I belieue,
any man who, as I ſayd, ſhall thinke well before he ſpeake, and then
ſpeak as he thinks, will hold it a very impoſſible thing to proue
evidently out of Scripture all things neceſſary, for the Church, as one
Myſticall Body; For every Degree; and for every particular Member therof,
according to the firſt Meaning of Evidence, and other preſcriptions which I
haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Let vs therfor looke backe a litle vpon thoſe three different
ſorts of Perſons.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Firſt: for Government and Governours of the Church,
if we abſtract from the Authority, Practiſe, Tradition, and interpretation
of Gods Church, I wonder who will goe about to proue with certainty out of
evident Scripture, what Epiſcopus muſt ſignify in Scripture; a Biſhop,
Superintendent, or Overſeer, or any who hath a charge or ſuperiority,
according to the faſhion of Proteſtants, who loue to take words according
to Grammaticall derivation, not according to the Eccleſiaſticall Ancient
vſe of them. Even Proteſtants grant that the words Presbyter and
Epiſcopus are in Scripture taken for the ſame: and Dr: Jer: Taylor in his
Defence of Epiſcopacy, [§. 23. Pag: 128.] ſaith expreſſly: <hi>The
firſt thing done in Chriſtendome, vpon the death of the Apoſtles in this
matter of Epiſcopacy, is the diſtinguiſhing of Names which before were
common.</hi> If they will tranſlate Presbyter to ſignify an Elder, what
Certainty can they receyve from that word, whether it ought to be taken for
elder in Age, or greater in Dignity? And it is no better than ridiculous, that
Proteſtants ſhould firſt deny vnwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Authority of the
Church for interpreting Scriptures, and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Controverſyes in Faith; and
then take great paynes to proue out of evident Scripture alone, that Biſhops
are de Jure Divino: and the ſame I ſay of any other particular Forme of
Eccleſiaſticall Government, and of the Quality, and Extent of Authority in
any ſuch Forme; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can inflict Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures, and
of what kind: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, and other ſuch Poynts neceſſary to be
knowne in the Church, Proteſtants in vayne and without end, will be
ſighting for an impoſſibility, till they acknowledge ſome other Rule or
judge of Controverſyes, than Scripture alone.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Beſides, how will they learne out of Scripture
alone, the Forme of Ordination of Prieſtes, and other Orders; the Matter and
Forme of other Sacraments, which ſome in the Church are to adminiſter by
Office, and others to receyue, (of which I ſhall ſpeake more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly 
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59214:72"/>hereafter) with diverſe other ſuch Poynts
neceſſary for the Church in generall?</p>
               <p n="13">13. Secondly: For diverſe Degrees or States in the
Church; no man can chuſe but ſee how hard it is to learne evidently out of
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone, what in particular belongs to every one both for Belief and
Practiſe.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Thirdly: For every particular Perſon: How can a
Proteſtant proue evidently out of Scripture the Nature of Faith, ſince one
Sect of them denyes Chriſtian Faith to be infallibly true, againſt the
reſt of their fellowes; and an other affirmes, that juſtifying Faith is
that wherby one firmly believes that he is juſt, which kind of Faith others
deny: or the neceſſary Extent of their Faith, ſeing <hi>Chilling:</hi>
holds that there cannot be given a Catalogue of Points neceſſary to be
believed explicitly by all, and therfor every one, muſt either remayne
vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, whether he believe all that is abſolutely neceſſary, or
elſe be obliged vnder damnation, to know explicitly all cleare paſſages
of Scripture (which are innumerable) leaſt otherwiſe he put himſelf in
danger, of wanting what is indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation;
which is a burthen, no leſſe vnreaſonable than intolerable, even to men
not vnlearned, and much more to vulgar Perſons.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Neither is there less diſſiculty concerning
Pennance or true Repentance, than Faith; ſince Proteſtants do not agree in
what Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance conſiſt, and <hi>Chilling:</hi> hath a conceypt different
from the reſt, that true Repentance requires the <hi>effectuall mortification
of the Habits of all vices, which being a worke of difficulty and tyme, cannot
be performed in an inſtant,</hi> as he writes [Pag. 392. N. 8.] and therfor
even that moſt perfect kind of ſorrow, which Divines call Contrition, and
is concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt ſin for the loue of God, will not ſerue at the
howre of ones death, becauſe, ſaith he, Repentance is a work of difficulty
and tyme.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Morover, it is impoſſible for Proteſtants to
proue evidently out of Scripture, that the Sacraments of Baptiſme, and
Pennance are not neceſſary for ſalvation. For where fynd they any ſuch
Text? If they ſay we muſt hold them not neceſſary, becauſe we find no
ſuch neceſſity evidently expreſt in Scripture, they do but begg the
Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuppoſe that all things neceſſary are contayned in
Scripture; beſides, that we haue Scripture for both <hi>Niſi quis
renatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fuerit &amp;c:
vntess one ſhall be borne againe, &amp;c:</hi> [Ioan: 3.5.] <hi>And, whoſe
ſinnes you retayne, they are retayned:</hi> [Ioan. 20.23.] and it is
impoſſible for any <pb n="128" facs="tcp:59214:73"/>man to ſhew evidently out of
Scripture, that thoſe Texts are not de facto vnderſtood as we vnderſtand
them, ſince it is moſt evident, that the words are capable of ſuch a
ſenſe; and conſequently we cannot be certaine but that ſuch is their
meaning, vnless they can bring ſome evident Text to the contrary;
eſpecially ſince that even divers chief learned Proteſtants teach the
neceſſity of Baptiſme for children of the Faithfull, as I ſhew
herafter. And certainly if Scripture were evident againſt this Doctrine of
Catholiques, ſo many learned Proteſtants could not but haue ſeene it.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The ſame I ſay of the Sacrament of Pennance,
which divers lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants hold to be ſo neceſſary, as ſome
ſay that; <hi>It is a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thing to take away private Abſolution:</hi>
And that, <hi>They who contemne it, do not vnderſtand what is Remisſion of
ſinnes, or the power of the keyes:</hi> And, that it is an <hi>Errour to
affirme, that Confesſion made before God,</hi> doth ſuffice: And that,
<hi>Private Confesſion being taken away, Chriſt gave the keyes in
vaine</hi> (vide <hi>Triple Cord,</hi> Chap. 24. Pag. 613.) And, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae
<hi>Lutheri Autore Gaſparo Vienbergio Lippienſi,</hi> [Cap. 30.] it is
ſayd: <hi>Oſiander primus ex miniſtris Norinbergae Confesſionem
privatam vrgebat ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut neceſſariam. Oſiander was the firſt Miniſter
at Norinberg, who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red private Confesſion as a thing
neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. Now I argue in this manner. Some poyntes in the
Opinion, both of Catholiques, and Proteſtants are neceſſary to
ſalvation for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Perſon: for example, Faith; and Repentance
after deadly ſin; And yet we ſee that, Proteſtants differ both from
Catholikes, and diſagree amongſt themſelves, about the nature of Faith,
and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and diſagree ſo, as that both ſydes cannot have true
Faith, and Repentance. For, if true Faith muſt be infallible;
<hi>Chilling:</hi> and his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, cannot be ſaved, both becauſe
they believe and teach ſo capitall an Errour, and becauſe they practiſe
it, being ſatiſfyed with a probable fallible Faith. The like I ſay of
that juſtifiyng Faith which Calviniſts hold neceſſary for
juſtification, and ſalvation, againſt Catholikes and all other
Proteſtants, even Socinians who believe it to be a meer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
preſumptuous fancy. As alſo the ſame may be ſayd of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and
the ſacrament of Pennance, which according to all Catholikes and diuers
Proteſtants, are neceſſary to ſalvation, againſt many other
Proteſtants. Therfor Proteſtants muſt confess that all things
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, are not evident in Scripture, vnless they will
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an inevitable ſentence of damnation againſt thoſe, whom they 
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59214:73"/>call Brethren, as Teaching an Errour in matters
neceſſary to ſalvation, and practiſing in conformity to their errour,
either by omitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or being cauſe by their Doctrine, that
others Neglect, or ommit things abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation:
which judgment, I belieue, they will not be haſty to frame againſt their
Brethren, but rather will pretend to conceyve of theſe particular poynts of
which we ſpeake, as <hi>Chilling:</hi> (Pag: 41. N. 13.) ſpeakes in
generall of perſons contrary in belief, which <hi>may be concerning poynts
wherin Scripture may with ſogreat probability be alledged on both ſides
(which is a ſure note of a point not neceſſary) that men of honeſt and
vpright harts, true lovers of God and truth, ſuch as deſire, above all
things, to know Gods will and to doe it, may without any fault at all, ſome
goe one way, and ſome another:</hi> which kind of opinion if they thinke fitt
to frame of their brethren, as being <hi>men of honeſt and vpright harts,
true lovers of God and truth</hi> &amp;c: they muſt give me leave to infer,
that ſcripture is not evident in all poynts, even where there is queſtion
of Articles abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Which reaſon taken from their mutuall
diſagreements in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary matters, doth prove that they are not evident
in ſcripture, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Chilling:</hi> ſaying (Pag, 61. N. 24.)
<hi>The thing is not evident of it ſelfe; which is evident, becauſe many do
not believe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Nay, further I muſt inferr, that, ſeing in points
abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, Charitas propria, the vertue of
Charity as it reſpects our ſelves, obligeth every one to chuſe the
ſafer part, and that Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants cannot fynd any evident ſcripture that
the Sacraments of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and pennance are not neceſſary for
ſalvation, (not only all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, but divers chief Proteſtants holding
them to be neceſſary) it followes, that proreſtants are obliged to
believe them to be neceſſary, and accordingly to frame their practiſe.
Neither can they be excuſed by <hi>Chilling worths</hi> ſayinge that <hi>it
is a ſure note of a point not neceſſary,</hi> that ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may with
great <hi>probability be alledged on both ſides;</hi> becauſe this
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe implies a begging of the Queſtion, as if there were no meanes, to
be aſſured of what is neceſſary to ſalvation, except ſcripture
alone; yea rather he ought, from the difficulty which he apprehends in
ſcripture for theſe matters of ſo great moment, neceſſarily to infer,
that the written word taken alone, contaynes not evidently all neceſſary
points.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Thus even in this firſt entrance it appeares, how
not only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, but vnreaſonable alſo, this common Tenet of Proteſtants
is.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:59214:74"/>
               <p n="22">22. Which will yet be more manifeſt, if we conſider,
that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is neceſſary for the Curch immediatly, as it is one
community, or body, the ſame muſt be mediatè neceſſary for every
particular member: as in a naturall body, whatſoever is neceſſary for
preſerving the whole, is conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly neceſſary for every part, which
would be deſtroyed by the deſtruction of the whole, as alſo the
deſtruction of all the parts collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves is the diſtruction of the whole.
And ſo if the ſcripture be nor evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in poynts neceſſary to
ſalvation for every part immediatè, it would follow mediatè,
that it is not evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for all poynts neceſſary for the whole, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though
it wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted nothing immediatly neceſſary forthe whole, as gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours &amp;c:
and there is in this, a neceſſary connectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> between theſe
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of the whole a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d every part. It is true, every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not
obliged to be Biſhop, or a Clergy man; to abſolue from ſins, to
conſecrate the Euchariſt; jnflict conſurs; to Gouerne; make Lawes;
Adminiſter Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſet downe a Liturgy, or publike worſhip of God,
and the like; yet it is neceſſary for every one to be a member of the true
Church, in which all theſe advantages muſt be found; it being the firſt
principle a mongſt Chriſtians, that remiſſion of ſins, and
ſalvation, cannot be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, out of thetrue church, nor many grievous
ſins avoyded if one be a member of a body governed by vnlawfull ſuperiours,
guyded by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Lawes, deſtitute of power to puniſh offenders, fed with
falſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memts, tyed to a ſuperſtitious or ſacrilegious Liturgi
&amp;c: And therfore as it is impoſſible to prove out of evident
ſcripture, all the poynts which concerne immediatly the whole body of the
Church, ſo we muſt even for that ſame reaſon infer, that it is not
poſſible to prove out of evident Scripture, whatſoever is neceſſary
for every particular perſon.</p>
               <p n="23">23. I have ſtayed longer in this entrance, than I
intented; yet I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, not vnprofitably; ſince I have already proved, as it
were by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall view, the improbability and impoſſibility, that all
things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſhould be contayned evidently in ſcripture taken
alone. Which by Gods holy aſſiſtance I hope to evince more in particular
by the reaſons following.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Firſt: ſeeing proteſtants will haue nothing
believed as matter of Faith, which is not evident in ſcripture; this very
principle of theirs, <hi>That all things neceſſary are evidently contayned
in Scripture,</hi> muſt be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proved out of ſcriptures, as the
foundation of all their Faith: it muſt, I ſay, be proved by ſome Text,
evidently affirming, not only that all poynts of Faith are contained in
ſcripture, but that they are contayned <pb n="131" facs="tcp:59214:74"/>evidently.
Othetwiſe, if it be but obſcure, we cannot haue that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is
neceſſary to Faith. For, this being a poynt not evident to naturall
Reaſon, but depending on Gods free Determination, we muſt only know it by
Revelation, or the Teſtimony, and word of God, that is [according to
proteſtants] only by ſcripture. Now they are not able to produce any ſuch
evident Text. Which will appeare by anſwering, and evidently confuting their
objections out of ſcripture. And therfor they cannot with certainty believe
the ſayd principle. Your ſelf ſay Pag 61. N. 23.] <hi>If our Saviour had
intended that all Controverſyes in Religion ſhould be by ſome viſible
judg finally determined, who can doubt but in playne termes he would have
expreſſed himſelf about this matter?</hi> And may not we turne the ſame
argument againſt you, and ſay; <hi>If our Saviour had intended,</hi> that
all poynts of Faith and religion ſhould be evident in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without
relation to any viſible judg, church, or vnwrtiten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>who can
doubt but in plaine termes he would have expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this
matter?</hi> And my retortion is ſtronger than your Argument can be;
becauſe true Catholique Doctrine belieues not only ſcripture, or the
written word of God, but tradition alſo, or the word of God not written,
which all grant to haue bene before ſcripture, and from which you confess we
receiue ſcripture it ſelf. And ſo although nothing were ſayd in
ſcripture, of a viſibſe judg to determine controverſyes in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
yet vniuerſall tradition; ſenſe of all Chriſtians; and practiſe of
Gods church, in determining and defining matters of Faith, were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to aſſure vs therof. But Proteſtants muſt either alledg evident
ſcripture, or nothing at all. This I ſay, not as if we wanted evident
ſcripture, for the neceſſity of a viſible judg of controverſyes, but
only to ſhew, that we haue not that neceſſity of alledging ſcripture,
for this, and every other particular poynt, which Proteſtants haue.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Secondly: I proue our aſſertion thus: we are to
ſuppoſe, that Allmighty God, having ordayned Man to a ſupernaturall End,
cannot faile to provide, on his part, meanes ſufficient for attaining therof.
Since then Faith is neceſſary for ariving to that End, if it cannot be
learned except by ſcripture alone, no doubt but he would have obliged the
Apoſtles to write, as he obliged them to preach, and Chriſtians to heare
the Goſpell. For if he left it to their freedom, it is cleare that he did not
eſteeme writing to be neceſſary; which yet muſt be moſt
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary if we can attaine Faith, and ſalvation only by ſcripture.
But Proteſtants, even for this cauſe, that they are to belieue nothing
which <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59214:75"/>is not expreſſed in ſcripture, cannot affirme
that our Saviour gaue any ſuch command to his Apoſtles, ſeing it is
evident no ſuch thing is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in ſcripture. Therfor they cannot
avouch any ſuch command. But, for preaching, we read, (Marc: 16. V. 15.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Going into the whole world, preach yee
the Goſpell to all creatures. And in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to this command, it is
recorded (V. 20.) But they going forth, preached every where.</q> And our
Saviour living on earth, ſent his Apoſtles abroad with this injunction,
(Matth: 10.7.) Euntes praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, Goe preach. The Apoſtle ſaith: (Rom:
10.17.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Faith is by hearing. And (V. 18.) have
they not heard? And certes into all the earth hath the ſound of them gone
forth: and vnto the ends of the whole earth the words of them:</q> where we
heare, of hearing and ſpeaking, but not of writing or reading: of a ſound
conveyed to the eares of the whole world, not of any booke or writing, ſet
before their eyes. Thus we ſee, that only two of the Apoſtles haue alſo
made themſelves Evangeliſts by writing the Goſpell, though all were
Evangeliſts by preaching it. <hi>Chill:</hi> and his fellowes thinke, they
can demonſtrate out of S. Luke more clearly than out of any other
Evangeliſt, that his Goſpell contaynes all poynts neceſſary to
ſalvation, and yet He is ſo farr from producing any command he had to
write, [which had bene the moſt cleare, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, and neceſſary
cauſe that could haue bene alledged] that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily he ſhewes that it was
done by free election, ſaying, (Luc: 1.1. &amp; 3.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">becauſe many haue gone about,
&amp;c.</q> It ſeemed good alſo to me to write, &amp;c. Neither doth any
one of all the Canonicall writers alledg a command for writing. S. Paule
ſaith (1. Cor: 9.16) 
<q rend="margQuotes">If I evangelize, it is no glory to me:
for neceſſity lyeth vpon me: for woe is to me if I evangelize not.</q> But
he ſayes not, woe to me if I write not; and accordingly we ſee ſome of
the canonicall writers differred writing a long tyme after our B. Sauiours
Aſcenſion, and did not write but on ſeverall incident occaſions, as
Bellarmine de verbo Dei [L. 4. C. 4.] demonſtrates out of Euſebius. If then
it was not judged neceſſary, that ſcripture ſhould be written, but that
the Church had other meanes to beget and conſerue true Faith and religion, as
S. Paule [1. Cor: 15.1.] expreſſly ſaith: 
<q rend="margQuotes">I doe you to vnderſtand the Goſpell
which I preached vnto you, which alſo you received, in the which alſo you
ſtand.</q> And (V. 11.) So we preach, and ſo you haue believed. What can be
more vnreaſonable, than to belieue it to be neceſſary, that all things
neceſſary be evidently contayned in ſcripture alone, without 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59214:75"/>dependance on tradition, or the church? Or who can believe
that the Saints Paule, Iames, Iude, Iohn, in their Epiſtles written vpon
ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall occaſions, or to private perſons, intended to write a
Catechiſme, or ſpecify all neceſſary points of Faith? Hence it is that
Euſebius, (His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: Eccles: L. 3. C. 24.) affirmes, that S. Iohn was ſayd
to haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Goſpell even almoſt to the end of his life without
notice of any ſcripture; and in generall, that the Apoſtles were not
ſollicitous to write much. And the ſame is obſerved by S. Chryſoſtome
(Hom: 1. in Act. Apoſt.) If then Proteſtants cannot proue by evident
ſcripture, that all Canonicall writers receyved a command to write, how will
they proue that they were bound to publiſh their writings, wherof (as I
ſayd) ſome were directed to private perſons, or that, others were, or are
bound to publiſh them; or to reade them being publiſhed? And if they can
ſhew no command for theſe things, how can they maintayne, that there is no
meanes to know matters of Faith, except by ſcripture?</p>
               <p n="26">26. Thirdly: you teach; That all neceſſary poynts are
evident in ſcripture, though there be many points evident which are not
neceſſary: that we cannot preciſely determine what points in particular
be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: that ſuch a determination or diſtinction is needless.
For all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary points being evident in ſcripture, whoſoever
believes all evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent points, is ſure to know all neceſſary points, and
more. This is your chiefeſt ground in this matter. But it is evidently
refuted by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you to reflect, that by this meanes, all muſt be obliged
to know all the cleare or evident texts of ſcripture: otherwiſe he cannot
be ſure that he knowes all neceſſary points, ſince you giue him the
aſſurance of knowing all neceſſary points, only by this meanes of
knowing all points that are evident. Therfore if he be not ſure, that he
knowes all evident points, he cannot be ſure that he knowes all ſuch as are
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Yea every one will be obliged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to know every text, or
period of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and to examine, whether it be evident or obſcure,
leaſt, that if vpon examination it appeare to be evident, he might perhaps
haue fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſome neceſſary poynt, if the text had proved to be
evident, and yet vnknown to him for want of ſuch examination. Neither can it
be anſwered, that if a text be evident, it will appeare to be ſuch. For, a
thing vpon due examination and ſtudy, may appeare evident, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
which at firſt ſight did not ſeeme to be ſuch. And for this ſame
reaſon, every one muſt learne to reade the bible, or at leaſt procure
that every text therof be read to him, that ſo he may be ſure to know all 
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59214:76"/>evident, and conſequently all neceſſary texts of
ſcripture; it being cleare that he cannot haue ſufficient aſſurance,
that he knowes every particular text, only by hearing ſermons, or ordinary
caſvall diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or the like. And this care every one ſhall be
obliged to vſe, even for thoſe books of ſcripture, which are receyved by
ſome Proteſtants, and rejected by others; leaſt if indeed they be
Canonicall, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne ignorant of any one poynt evidently contayned in
them, he put himſelf in danger, of wanting the knowledg of ſome thing
neceſſary to be believed, You teach (Pag: 23. N. 27.) that, to make a
catalogue of fundamentall points <hi>had been to no purpoſe, there being, as
matters now ſtand, as great necesſity of believing thoſe truths of
ſcripture, which are not fundamentall, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe that are.</hi> But it is neceſſary for
every one, learned, or vnlearned, to know explicitly all fundamentall truths:
Therfor it is neceſſary for every one to know explicitly all truths, though
not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall. Now who ſees not, that theſe are ridiculous,
vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and intolerable precepts, and burthens, impoſed vpon mens
conſciences without any ground, except an obſtinate reſolution to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
your opinion, that all things neceſſary are evident in ſcripture? And yet
I do not perceiue how Proteſtants can avoyd theſe ſequeles, if they will
ſtand to thoſe principles. For whoſoeuer is obliged to attaine an End, is
obliged to vſe that meanes which is neceſſary for that End. Your ſelf
(Pag: 194. N. 4.) hold it for an abſurdity, that it <hi>should be a damnable
ſin, in any learned man</hi> (and I may ſay much more in any vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
perſon) <hi>actually to disbelieue any one particular Hiſtoricall verity
contayned in Scripture, or to belieue the contradiction of it, though be know
it not to be there con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ed.</hi> Now I ſay, according to this your Doctrine, every one
muſt know every truth in ſcripture: and not only not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it, but he
muſt explicitly know it, leaſt otherwiſe he may chance to omitt the
belief of ſome poynt neceſſary to be expreſſiy believed: Which is a
greater abſurdity than only to ſay, every one is obliged not to contradict
any truth contayned in ſcripture, though he know it not to be there
contayned. And as for our preſent purpoſe, you clearly ſuppoſe, that
every man, though he be learned, is not obliged to know every truth contayned
in Scripture: and therfor your Doctrine which neceſſarily infers this
obligation, muſt be abſurd, and contradictory to yourſelf.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Fourthly: in Holy ſcripture two things are to be
conſidered. The words, and ſenſe, or meaning of them. The words are
cleare in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <pb n="135" facs="tcp:59214:76"/>as in other bookes, to ſuch as
vnderſtand the language. But for the ſenſe; it may be affirmed with much
truth,, that, abſtracting from extrinſecall helpe, or autority, euen in
matters of greateſt moment, proper to Chriſtian religion, it is hard to
fynd any one poynt ſo cleare of it ſelf, as to convince, that it muſt
needs be vnderſtood in this, or thar determinate ſenſe. For, though the
words may ſeeme clearly to ſignify ſuch a thing in objects proportionate
to our naturall reaſon: yet the hardness, and height, of Chriſtian belief
is apt to withdraw our vnderſtanding from yeilding a firme aſſent to
points which truly are aboue, and in ſhew ſeeme to be againſt reaſon.
For this I will alledg your ſelfe, who (Pag: 215. N. 46.) ſpeake thus:
<hi>They which doe captivate their vnderſtandings to the belief of thoſe
things which to their vnderſtanding ſeeme irreconſiable Contradictions,
may as well believe reall contraditions.</hi> Since then no man can belieue
reall contradictions appearing ſuch, it followes according to your owne
aſſertion, that none can belieue thoſe poynts which to his
vnderſtanding ſeeme contradictions; and then he will be ſeeking ſome
other by-ſenſe of ſuch words as taken in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious common
ſignification, may ſeeme in his way of vnderſtanding, to imply
contradiction. Which yet appeares more clearly out of other words of yours
(Pag: 216.217. N. 46.) where having ſett downe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers contradictions (as you
vntruly apprehend) in our catholique doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine concerning the B. Sacrament of
the Euchariſt, you conclude, that if <hi>Char: Maintayned cannot compoſe
their repugnance, and that after an intelligible manner, then we muſt giue
him leaue to belieue that either we do not belieue Tranſubſtantiation, or
elſe that it is no contradiction that men should ſubjugate their
vnderſtandings to the belief of contradictions.</hi> Which words declare, how
willing a mans vnderſtanding, or reaſon is to be at peace with it ſelf,
and to belieue nothing, wherin it cannot <hi>Compoſe all repugnance;</hi> and
that <hi>after an intelligible manner.</hi> Seing then, all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
muſt belieue the words of ſcripture to be true, and yet find difficulty in
compoſing all repugnance to reaſon <hi>after an intelligible manner,</hi>
they are eaſily drawne, to entertayne ſome interpretation, agreeable to
their vnderſtanding, though contrary to the ſignifitation, which the words
of themſelves do clearly import, and perhaps was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Holy
Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="28">28. From this fountaine ariſe ſo many, and ſo
different, and contrary hereſies concerning the chiefeſt articles of
Chriſtian Faith; the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the objects, and diſproportion to our
naturall reaſon, firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59214:77"/>and then averting
our vnderſtanding, from that which it ſees not cleared after an
intelligible manner, and the loss of the firſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and vſuall
ſignification of the words bringing men to a loss in the purſuite of the
true ſenſe of them. For this cauſe, the particular Grace of the Holy
Ghoſt is neceſſary to belieue as we ought; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Fulk (againſt
Rhem: Teſtam: in 2 Petr: 3. Pag: 821.) ſaith; <hi>As concerning the
Argument and matter of the Scripture, we confess that for the moſt and
chiefeſt matters, it is not only hard, but imposſible to be vnderſtood of
the naturall man.</hi> Beſides which difficulty, ariſing from the Objects,
or Myſteryes in themſelves, there is another proceeding from the ſubject,
or Believer, when one hath already taken a Point for true, and for that cauſe
will be willing to ſeeke, and glad to fynd, ſome ſenſe of Scripture
agreeable to his foreconceyved opinion, though not without violence to the
letter, or words.</p>
               <p n="29">29. And yet to theſe diſſicultyes, flowing from the
Object, and Sabject, we may add another, ex Adjunctis; when one place of
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeeming cleare enough of it ſelf, growes to be hard, by being
compared with the obvious ſenſe of that other Text, as we haue heard out of
<hi>Chilling:</hi> [Pag: 41. N. 13.] that <hi>Scripture may with ſo great
probability be alledged on both ſides, that men of vpright harts may ſome
goe one way, and ſome another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">30. What words more cleare, than thoſe of our B Saviour
[Matth: 26. V. 26.] <hi>This is my Body?</hi> Inſomuch as <hi>Luther</hi> in
his Booke <hi>Defenſio verborum Coenae,</hi> ſaies againſt the
<hi>Sacramentaryes,</hi> who deny the Reall preſence: <hi>This Hereſy doth
not impugne doubtfull opinyons and doubtfull Teſtimonyes of Scripture, but
plaine and express ſentences of Scripture,</hi> yet many Proteſtants deny
this Myſtery of the Reall preſence, vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that other Texts of
Scripture are contrary to it, and in particular that, in S. Iohn's Goſpell
[Cap: 6. V. 63.] 
<q rend="margQuotes">It is the ſpirit that quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth,
the fleſh profiteth nothing.</q> Which is a ſtrange kind of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
words moſt cleare, by a Text very obſcure. But God in his holy Providence,
permits theſe men to fall vpon ſuch impertinences for their owne
confutation; as happens in this occaſion. For as they deny the Reall
preſence of our Saviours Body in the Euchariſt, ſo they deny, or elude,
the reall Preſence, or Deſcent of his ſoule into Hell, interpreting
thoſe words of the Acts 2.27. 
<q rend="margQuotes">Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in Hell,
<hi>Non relenques cadaver meum in ſepulchro; Thou wilt not leaue my dead Body
in the ſepulcher.</hi>
                  </q> So Beza vpon that place. And Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius 
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59214:77"/>in Antibellarm: [Pag: 42.] <hi>Nihil vetat, per Animam
ſynecdochicè intelligere ipſum corpus, &amp; quidem jam mortuum. We
may well by a ſynec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche vnderſtand by the ſoule the body even the dead
body. Serranus contra Hayum,</hi> ſayth, that <hi>per animam (Act:</hi> 2.
<hi>V.</hi> 27.) <hi>non intelligitur anima, (marke, ſoule, not the ſoule)
ſed mortuus homo, ſiue cadaver, but a dead man, or a dead body.</hi> And
(which is ſtrange) he aſſirmes, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is cleare. For
the preſent I will not examine this ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of an Article
of our Creed, Deſcendit ad inferos, He deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vnto Hell: (Of which,
<hi>Potter</hi> [Pag: 240.] ſayth: <hi>The words are ſo plame, they beare
their meaning before them</hi>) nor will I obſerue, even by this example, how
far Scripture is from being evident, to theſe men who faine ſuch
gloſſes, vpon words ſo cleare, and yet ſay that their interpretation is
cleare. But I will only ſay; if the ſoule, which is a ſpirit, may
ſignify fleſh, and fleſh be taken for the ſoule or ſpirit, thoſe
words, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Spiritus eſt qui vivificat, caro non
prodeſt quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, It is the ſpirit that quickeneth, the fleſh
proſiteth nothing,</q> may be inverted and taken thus againſt themſelves,
caro eſt quae vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat, ſpiritus non prodeſt quicquam: <hi>It is the
fleſh which quickeneth, the ſpirit profiteth nothing.</hi> For if the
ſoule may ſignify the body, why may not the body ſignify the ſoule, by
the ſame new kind or Figure? In the meane tyme, theſe men ſhould
conſider, that their owne Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes aſſirme, S. Iohn in that ſixth
Chapter not to ſpeak of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and it is a ſtrange kind of proofe,
to argue out of Scripture for that, of which that Scripture is confeſſed
(even by him who ſo argues) not to ſpeak. But becauſe many examples, or
inſtances may be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to proue the difficulty of Scripture, even in the
moſt Principall, and Fundamentall Articles of our Faith, we will touch ſome
in the next Reaſon; for to ſpeak of all, would be endless.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Fiftly. The ſame is demonſtrated by theſe
particulars. What can be more cleare to proue the Conſubſtantiality of the
ſon of God with his Eternall Father, than, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Ego &amp; Pater vnum ſumus Ioan: 10.
V. 13.] I and the Father are one?</q> And yet the old, and new Arians with
<hi>Chilling:</hi> and other <hi>Socinians</hi> deny it, pretending (falſly)
that it is againſt Reaſon, and contrary to other. Text of Scripture. What
can be more expreſſly delivered, if we reſpect the bare word, than that
there is one God, Creatour of Heaven and Earth? And yet for the ſignification
of the words (to omit old Heretiques, as the Simoniani, Menandriani,
Baſilidiani, Valentiniſtae, Marcioniſtae, Manichaei, <pb n="138" facs="tcp:59214:78"/>and the whole rabble of the Gnoſtici, who taught that there is not
one God Omnipotent, Creatour of Heaven and Earth) haue we not in our dayes
<hi>Socinians,</hi> who indeed deſtroy the true God, by making him a Subject
of Accidents, and depriving him of his Immenſity, Omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience of futura 
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Crellius Lib: 1. de vera Religione,
Cap: 24.</note> Contingentia, or the future Actions which are to proceed from
Freewill? although nothing be more cleare in Scripture, than that, God is every
where, filling Heaven and Earth, and that, one diſtinction of the true God
from falſe ones, is, that he can infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly foretell things to come, and
that he inſpired Prophets, to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with abſolute certainty, things
remote, for Tyme and Place: which being denyed, the books of the Prophets
muſt be rent from the Bible as deluding men, and worſe than Apocriphall.

Doth not <hi>Calvin</hi> depriue God of Mercy and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in teaching that
he predeſtinates men, to eternall damnation, and puniſhes them for ſins
to which they were neceſſitated by the ſame God? What can be more cleare
in our Creed, and ſcripture, than that Chriſt was conceyved of the Holy
Ghoſt, borne of the Virgin Mary, ſuffered, dyed, roſe agayne, and
aſcended into Heaven, if we looke vpon the words? And yet for the ſenſe,
(which is the life and ſoule of ſcripture) there are moſt different, and
contrary doctrines, concerning theſe Poynts. I let pass thoſe Heretiques,
who taught that Chriſt ſuffered not really, but only in appearance or
ſhew. (And why might not they as well ſay, that the words, he was crucifyed
and dyed, are not to be taken litterally, as our Sacramentaryes teach the
words, This is my body, are to be vnderſtood figuratively?) But theſe I let
pass, and only reflect, that for the thing ſignifyed by thoſe words,
accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our moderne Sectaryes, there is neither certainty, who he is that
was borne, ſuffered, dyed, roſe agayne &amp;c: nor of the End for which he
was borne, ſuffered, and dyed; nor of the Effect and Fruite of his life and
Death. For, <hi>Socinians</hi> deny that he who was borne, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered &amp;c:
was true God and Man: or that the End for which he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was to redeeme
vs, by ſatisfying, and paying the ranſome of our ſins, but only by way of
inſtructing, or giving vs exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. And Calviniſts teache, that, the Effect
or Fruite of our Saviours Actions, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, is not any true
remiſſion, or waſhing away our ſins, but only a <pb n="139" facs="tcp:59214:78"/>not imputing them, their guilt and deformity ſtill remaining, as
<hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> [in 2. Corinth: 5. V. 21.] declares <hi>Quomodo juſti coram
Deo ſumus? Qualiter ſcilicet Chriſtus fuit peccator. How are we juſt
befor God? in ſuch manner as Chriſt was a ſinner.</hi> O injury to men,
as if none were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe juſt than Chriſt was a ſinner (of whom it is
ſayd: 
<q rend="margQuotes">It was ſeemly that we ſhould haue
ſuch a high Prieſt, holy, innocent, impolluted, ſeparated from ſinners,
(Heb: 7. V. 26.) O blaſphemy againſt Chriſt our Lord, as if he had bene
truly a ſinner as juſt men are truly juſt; of whom we reade evident texts
that they are renewed in the ſpirit of their mynd, and haue put on the new
man which according to God is created in juſtice, and holiness of the truth
[Epheſ: 4.23.24.] (not of a falſhood or diſguiſe of truth) that they
are regenerated and Renewed of the Holy Ghoſt; (Tit: 3.3.) that their ſins
are taken away [1. Paral: 21.8.] that cleare water is powred vpon them, and
they clenſed from all their contaminations. [Ezech, 36.25.] that they
ſhalbe ſprinkled with hyſſope, clenſed, waſhed and made whyter than
ſnow, [Pſalm. 50, 9.] that their ſins ſhalbe ſought, and ſhall not

they are all fayre, and there is not a ſpot in them. (Cant. 4.7.) If thy
ſins ſhalbe as ſcarlet, they ſhalbe made whyte as ſnow: and if they
be red as vermelion, they ſhalbe whyte as wooll. (Iſay. 1.18.) they haue
waſhed their robes, and haue made them whyte in the bloud of the lamb.</q>
(Apoc. 7.14.) With ſundry other evident texts, which I cited in the
Introduction, Sect. 9. And yet our Sectaryes will haue juſt men and Saints to
be ſtill in ſinne, and ſo Calvinian ſaints are eternally ſtayned with
that, which is the moſt deteſtable thing in the very Divells, namely deadly
ſinne. The Apoſtle ſayth, (Rom. 5.18.) <hi>As by the diſobedience of
one man, many were made ſinners: ſo alſo by the Obedience of one many
ſhalbe made juſt.</hi> Will <hi>Calvin</hi> ſay, that <hi>we were made
ſinners</hi> only by imputation, and not by true ſin inexiſtent in our
ſoule? And how then can he deny, but that men are juſt by true inherent
Juſtice? And if it be ſo, how dare he blaſpheme, that Chriſt was a
ſinner, as juſt men are juſt; which is to ſay, that he was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by inherent ſinne, or injuſtice, as other ſinners are? But this is the
fruite of relying on ſcripture alone, that is indeed, of following their owne
fancy. What can be more evident and in more express words delivered in
ſcripture, than, that without the ſpeciall Grace of God, merited by our
Saviours Life and Death, we cannot doe any <pb n="140" facs="tcp:59214:79"/>worke, or
ſpeak any words, or think any thought avayling towards eternall ſalvation;
and yet <hi>Pelagians</hi> taught the contrary; and <hi>Socinians</hi> hold,
that we merit all for our ſelves, and Chriſt nothing for vs: as contrarily,
Proteſtants commonly ſay, that Chriſt merited all for vs, and we nothing
for our ſelves. So contrary Hereſyes ariſe, when once men deſpiſe the
Authority of Gods Church! What Poynt more cleare in ſcripture, and more

Angels behold our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhining with immortall glory in the divine Throne.
And S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, ſerm: 3. de Aſcenſione, ſaith to the ſame
purpoſe; an earthly body is ſeated aboue the higheſt Heaven: bones ere
while ſhut vp in a narrow grave, are placed in the company of Angels; a
mortall natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is placed in the boſome of immortality. And in the ſame

nothing to our condition by riſing againe. Whoſoever ſayes this, doth not
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the reaſon of the fleſh which he aſſumed, but confounds
the order, and evacuates the profit therof. I acnowledge to be myne that which
fell, that that may be myne which roſe. I acknowledg that to be myne, which
lay in the grave, that that may be myne which aſcended into Heauen.</q> From
this <hi>Secinian</hi> Hereſy it alſo followes, that indeed they deny his
true Aſcenſion ſince they give him, and vs, not his and our nature, but
another eſſentially different. But indeed is the Reſurrection of the dead
ſo cleare in ſcripture, for the ſenſe, without any help of Gods Church?
How then doth <hi>Dr. Potter</hi> (Pag. 122.) ſay in behalf of
<hi>Hookers</hi> and <hi>M. Mortons</hi> opinion; <hi>A learned man was
anciently made a Biſhop of the Catholique Church, though he did
profeſſedly doubt of the laſt Reſurrection of our Bodyes.</hi> Was he a
learned man? Then ſurely he vnderſtood the Grammaticall ſignification of
the words, and yet he erred in the ſenſe; as alſo many others did, who
denyed Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as Baſilidiani, Saturniani, Carpocratiani,
Valentiniani, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriani, Hieracitae, and others; which ſhewes the
neceſſity of a living judg, beſide the letter, or bare word of
ſcripture. Which appeares alſo, by the other example which you alledg as
cleare: That, They which belieue and repent, ſhalbe ſaved: That, they which
do not belieue or <pb n="143" facs="tcp:59214:80"/>repent, ſhalbe damned. For how is this
cleare for the ſenſe of the words, if it be not cleare what that Faith and
Repentance is without which none can be ſaved? And yet you teach a Faith and
a repentance, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from that which hitherto both Catholikes, and
Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts haue believed and taught; as alſo Calviniſts tell vs of a
Faith, juſtifying after a new faſhion; different both from Catholikes and
from Socinians: and yet what is more neceſſary to ſalvation than true
Faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</p>
               <p n="34">34. Neither are you more fortunate in your example, that,
it is clearly againſt Scripture, that <hi>the keeping of the Moſaicall Law
is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary to ſalvation.</hi> Yea this inſtance makes againſt your
ſelf, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves the neceſſity of a living judg. For the firſt
determination concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that poynt, was made in the Councell of the
Apoſtles (Act. 15. V. 28.) and the Scripture only relates, what their
definition was; and ſo this proves only, that the voyce of the Church, or
Councels, may be clear, both for the words and ſenſe; Or that it may be
declared by the Church of ſucceding ages, if it grow in tyme to be obſcure,
which happens in this very Councell. For, though no doubt but Chriſtians of
that tyme, vnderſtood fully the meaning of the Councell, by the declaration
of the Apoſtles, yet the contents therof, were afterward to be declared, to
all poſterity, by the Church how they were to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and
practiſed. The Councell ſayd, (Act. 15. V. 28. 29.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">It hath ſeemed good to the Holy
Ghoſt and to vs, to lay no further bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vpon you than theſe
neceſſary things; that you abſtayne from the things immolated to Idols,
and bloud, and that which is ſtrangled.</q> Doth not this rather ſeeme
contrary, than clearly in favour of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, that it is cleare in
Scripture that the Moſaicall Law is not neceſſary? For, one part, and
practiſe, and Law obliging the Iewes, was, to abſtaine from bloud, and that
which is ſtrangled (though I grant it was alſo commanded before, but not to
laſt always, as the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Chriſts Church declareth) 
<q rend="margQuotes">and yet in the councell it is ſayd to
be neceſſary.</q> And for the other point; that you abſtaine from the
things immolated to Idols, S. Paule teaches, that, abſtracting from an
erroneous conſcience, it is not neceſſary to abſtayne from them, and
yet in that Councell it is injoyned as a thing neceſſary. How then is this
poynt ſo cleare, if we looke on ſcripture alone, without reference to any
declaration, or practiſe of Gods church?</p>
               <p n="35">35. Beſides, for Circumciſion; (which as the
Apoſtle ſayth, brings <pb n="144" facs="tcp:59214:81"/>with it an obligation to
obſerue the whole Moſaicall Law, which obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is, you ſay clearly
not neceſſary) although if we take ſome words, or text of Scripture
alone, without any further reflection or conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may ſeeme
cleare, that it is not only not neceſſary, but hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, S. Paule ſaying
(Gal. 5.2.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">If you be circumciſed, Chriſt
ſhall profit you nothing: yet if we alſo call to mynd, the fact of the
ſame Apoſtle (Act 16. V. 3) ſaying, taking him, he circumcided him,
(Timothy) that other text, If you be circumciſed, Chriſt will profit you
nothing, which ſeemed cleare and vniverſall, will ſeeme difficult, and to
be vnderſtood with ſome explication or reſtraint.</q> For who will
imagine, that S. Paule would be author of that, wherby Timothy ſhould be
deprived of all the good, he could expect from the Sauiour of the world? And
the difficulty wilbe increaſed, if we add that S. Paule cauſed Timothy to
be circumciſed, 
<q rend="margQuotes">propter Iudaeos &amp;c. For the Iewes
who were in thoſe places; for they knew all of them, that his father was a
Gentile;</q> wherby one would apprehend, that S. Paule judged it neceſſary
(at leaſt per accidens, becauſe all knew that his father was a gentil) that
Timothy ſhould be circumciſed; and yet contrarily, (Gal. 2. N. 3.) it is
ſayd; 
<q rend="margQuotes">but neither Titus, wheras he was a
Gentil,</q> was compelled to be circumciſed. It is therfor very cleare that
this Poynt which you alledg as clearly expreſſed in Scripture, ought rather
to be numbred amongſt difficult, and obſcure places, and (directly
againſt your inference that there is no need of an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble guide)
ſhewes the neceſſity of ſuch a guide; becauſe this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
about the Moſaicall Law, was a Definition of a Counſell, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d muſt be
declared by the practiſe of Gods church, as being concerning ſome things,
not to be alwayes obſerved, but intended to be ordered by the ſayd Church;
without whoſe authority, how ſhould we know when, and in what manner, the
keeping of the Moſaicall Law became both vnneceſſary, and damnable;
mortua and mortifera, dead and deadly: ſince we ſee ſome part therof
obſerved by the Apoſtles after our Sauiours aſcenſion, and ſending
the Holy Ghoſt?</p>
               <p n="36">36. But at leaſt, though you haue erred in the firſt
part of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, concerning the evidence of Scripture, that the keeping
of the Moſaicall Law is not neceſſary to ſalvation; yet you haue
vndoubtedly proved your purpoſe in the other part, That good works are
neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="37">37. To this I anſwer: It is ſtrang you ſhould hold
this point of the <pb n="145" facs="tcp:59214:81"/>neceſſity of good works to
ſalvation, to be ſo evident in Scripture, that every one who believes the
Scripture hath ſufficient meanes to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and condemne the contrary
hereſie; ſeing you know the common Tenet of Proteſtants, that it is
impoſſible to keep the commandements, and the doctrine of many of them,
that all our actions are ſinnes. Can the breach of the commandements, be a
good worke? Or can ſinfull works be neceſſary to ſalvation? That is,
can it be neceſſary to doe that which is neceſſary for vs not to doe,
as every one is obliged not to ſinne? How then can you ſay, the Scripture
is cleare in this poynt, ſince ſo many of your chiefeſt brethren muſt
mayntayne the contrary, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them do in express termes deny good
works to be neceſſary, yea and call it <hi>a Papiſticall errour,</hi> yea
<hi>worſe than is the Papiſts Doctrine;</hi> as is exactly ſett downe in
Brierly (Tract. 2. Cap. 2. Sect. 10. ſubdiviſ. 4.) And ſee in the ſame
Author, (Tract. 3. Sect. 7. N. 7.) The neceſſity of good works contradicted
for new Papiſtry, as pernicious as the old, by Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus in Praefat. ad Rom.
and many others, And all this they pretend to doe vpon the warrant of evident
ſcripture?</p>
               <p n="37">37. And heer I am to obſerue, that (Pag, 157. N. 50.)
you having alledged ſome poynts as clearly contayned in ſcripture (and in
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, concerning Faith, Repentance, and Reſurrection of the body,
which we haue demonſtrated not to be clear without aſſiſtance from Gods
Church, and to be controverted even amongſt Proteſtants) add theſe
remarkable words: <hi>Theſe we conceyue both true, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſayes ſo, and Truths Fundamentall, becauſe they are neceſſary parts
of the Goſpell, wherof our Sauiour ſayes, Qui non crediderit
damnabitur.</hi> Therfor ſay I, ſcripture alone is not cleare, even in
Fundamentall points, which directly overthrowes the whole Foundation of
Proteſtants reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And becauſe heer you name expreſſly the
<hi>Reſurrection of the Body,</hi> and not only <hi>that all men ſhall
riſe againe at the laſt day,</hi> as you ſpoake (Pag. 101. N. 127.) I
would gladly know how it is a <hi>Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body</hi> which never
riſes againe, but another celeſtiall body is created to ſucceed it? And
what reckoning do you make of the (39. Articles) of the Engliſh Church?
ſince (Art 4.) it is ſayd: <hi>Chriſt did truly riſe rgaine from death,
and tooke againe his body, with fleſh, bones, and all things appertaining to
the perfection of mans nature, wher with he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heaven, and there
ſitteth vntill he returne to judg all men at the laſt day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="38">38. You ſee then, that he hath produced Fundamentall
poynts as <pb n="146" facs="tcp:59214:82"/>cleare in ſcripture, which are proved not to
be ſo. Of poynts not Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, he chuſeth in the ſame place one
example, ſo pregnant and certaine in his conceypt, that he hopes we will
grant it to be ſuch: namely, that Abraham begat Iſaac. But this text is not
ſo cleare, as he ſuppoſes. For how will he be ſure (if we take thoſe
words alone) that Abraham was Iſaacs Father, and not grandfather, or yet
higher? We reade in S. Matthew, (1.8.) Ioram begat Ozias: three Kings being
left out. For Ioram immediatly begat Ochozias Ochozias begat Ioas, Ioas begat
Amazias Amazias begat Azarias or Ozias (for he had two names) as is manifeſt
(1. Paral. 3.11. and 12. and 2. Paral. 22.9. &amp; ſeqq.) he therfor left out
three to wit, Ochoſias, Ioas, and Amazias. as alſo (Matth. 1.12.)
frequently in the Latin copy one generation is left out: for with S. Epiphanius
and others, it is thus to be ſupplyed and read: Joſias begat Jeconias and
his brethren: and Jeconias begat Jechonias in the tranſmigration of Babilon.
For now we haue only; Joſias begat Jechonias and his brethren in the
tranſmigration of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon. On the contrary; where (Genes. 11. V. 12.) it is
ſayd; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaxad begat Sale, as the Hebrew and Caldaean text haue, both in
this place, and alſo (1. Paral. 1.18. &amp; 24.) the Septuaginta both heer,
and there put Cainan between. For they ſaye; Arphaxad begat Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, and
Cainan begat Sale. S. Luke rollowes the Septuagint, (Chap. 36.) ſaying: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Who was of Sale, who was of Cainan, who
was of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaxad.</q> Beſides all this, what will he vnderſtand by genuit,
he begat, or, fuit Filius, he was the Son, which may haue divers
ſignifications, as Luc. (3.38.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Who was of Henos, who was of Seth, who
was of Adam, who was of God?</q> Where we ſee, Filius a ſon muſt be taken
in a different ſenſe, as it is referred to Henos, Seth, and Adam, and as it
is referred to God, vvhoſe naturall ſon Adam vvas not. But I may ſeeme to
haue ſayd too much, of ſuch a matter as this, vnless it did ſhevv
clearly, the difficulty of ſcripture, even in texts, vvhich ſcarcely
ſeeme capable of difficulty.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Sixtly: vvhatſoever effect Proteſtants yield to
Sacraments, at leaſt it is neceſſary they be maintayned and not quite

ſeing there vvant not learned Proteſtants vvho hold Baptiſme to be
neceſſary to ſalvation, if the ſcripture be not cleare in vvhat
concernes this Sacrament, it is not cleare in a neceſſary poynt as I
ſayd. Novv the <pb n="147" facs="tcp:59214:82"/>very vvord Sacrament (taken in this

Socinians teach, that it is an abuſe of the vvord Sacrament to apply it to

<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Volkelius Lib. 4: Cap. 22.</note> And

and ſo likewiſe doth Zuinglius (To: 1. Lib de Bapt. Fol. 96.) Theſe men
therefore muſt either confess the authority of Gods church and her infallible
Traditions, or yield to the pernicious Doctrine of Anabaptiſts. Dr. Taylor in
is Defence of. Epiſcopacy, is ſo full to our purpoſe for the
neceſſity of Traditions, that I thought ſit to tranſcribe his words as
they ly (§. 19.) which are theſe, [Pag: 100.] Although we had not proved
the immediate Divine <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59214:84"/>inſtitution of Epiſcopall power
over Presbyters, and the whole flock; yet Epiſcopacy is not leſſe then an
Apoſtolicall ordinance, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vs by the ſame authority that the
obſervation of the Lords day is. For, for that in the new Teſtament we haue
no precept, and nothing but the example of the Primitiue Diſciples meeting in
their Synaxes vpon that day, and ſo alſo they did on the ſaturday in the
Jewish Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, but yet (however that at Geneva, they were once in
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation to haue changed it into a Thurſday meeting to haue ſhowne their
Chriſtian liberty) we ſhould thinke ſtrangely of thoſe men that called
the Sunday Feſtivall leſſe then an Apoſticall ordinance, and
neceſſary now to be kept holy with ſuch obſervances as the Church hath
appointed.</p>
               <p>Baptiſme of infants is moſt certainly a holy and charitable
ordinance, and of ordinary neceſſity to all that ever cryed, and yet the
Church hath founded this rite vpon the tradition of the Apoſtles; and wiſe
men do eaſily obſerue that the Anabaptiſts can by the ſame probability
of ſcripture inforce a neceſſity of communicating infants vpon vs, as we
doe of baptizing infants vpon them, if we ſpeak of immediate Divine
inſtitution, or of practiſe Apoſtolicall recorded in ſcripture, and
therfore a great Maſter of Geneva in a book he writ againſt the
Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, was forced to fly to Apoſtolicall traditiue ordination, and
therfor the inſtitution of Biſhops, muſt be ſerved firſt, as having
fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer plea, and clearer evidence in ſcripture, then the baptizing of
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and yet they that deny this, are by the juſt anathema of the
Catholick Church, confidently condemned for Hereticks.</p>
               <p>Of the ſame conſideration are diverſe other things in
Chriſtianity, as the Presbyters conſecrating the Euchariſt; for if the
Apoſtles in the firſt inſtitution did repreſent the whole Church,
Clergy and Laity, when Chriſt ſayd [Hoc facite, Doe this] then why may not
every Chriſtian man there repreſented, doe that which the Apoſtles in the
name of all were commanded to doe? If the Apoſtles did not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the
whole Church, why then doe all communicate? Or what place, or intimation of
Chriſtes ſaying is there in all the foure Goſpells, limiting [Hoc facite,
id eſt, benedicite] to the Clergy, and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding [Hoc facite, id eſt,
accipite &amp; manducate] to the Laity? This alſo reſts vpon the practiſe
Apoſtolicall and traditive interpretation of H: Church, and yet cannot be
denyed that ſo it ought to be, by any man that would not haue his
Chriſtendome ſuſpected.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:59214:84"/>
               <p>To theſe I adde the Communion of Women, the diſtinction of
boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes Apocryphall, from Canonicall, that ſuch books were written by ſuch
Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles, the whole tradition of ſcripture it ſelfe,
the Apoſtles Creed, the feaſt of Eaſter (which amongſt all men that cry
vp the Sunday-Feſtivall for a Divine inſtitution, muſt needs prevaile as
Caput inſtitutionis, it being that for which the Sunday is commemorated.)
Theſe and diverſe others of greater conſequence (which I dare not
ſpecify for feare of being miſunderſtood) rely but vpon equall faith with
this of Epiſcopacy (though I ſhould waue all the arguments for immediate
Divine ordinance) and therfore it is but reaſonable it ſhould be ranked
amongſt the Credenda of Chriſtianity, which the Church hath entertained
vpon the confidence of that which we call the Faith of a Chriſtian, whoſe
Maſter is truth it ſelfe. Thus farr the Doctour: in whom, beſide other
divers points for our purpoſe, it is remarkable, that he affirmes the deniall
of the baptizing of infants to be an Hereſy, and yet that the contrary truth
is not contained in ſcripture; which therfore cannot be ſayd to containe
all neceſſary points of Faith.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Seaventhly: it is a prodigious kind of thing, that
Proteſtants would make men belieue, that all neceſſary poynts are evident
in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet for vnderſtanding ſcripture preſcribe certaine
neceſſary Rules or Meanes which it is evident few can poſſibly
obſerue, and no leſſe evident by the confeſſion of our adverſaryes,
that being obſerved, they are not ſufficient; and conſequently even by
thoſe Meanes aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for vnderſtanding ſcripture, we know that
ſcripture is not evident, in all neceſſary things; which is a poynt well
to be noted. <hi>Sanchius de ſacra ſcriptura</hi> (<hi>Col:</hi> 409.)
ſaith: <hi>The Holy ſcripture, in thoſe things which are neceſſary to
be knowne for ſalvation, is ſo cleare, that it may eaſily he
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of all thoſe who are indued with Gods ſpirit, and who reade
it attentively and dayly, and vnderſtand the words and phraſes therof.
Eaſily?</hi> Doth not this contradict all the former words, which require
knowledg hard to be gotten, and paynes not eaſy to be taken? The ſcripture
(ſayth this Proteſtant) is cleare in all neceſſary poynts, to all that
are indued with the ſpirit of God. But if they be indued with the ſpirit of
God, they are preſuppoſed to haue true Faith for points neceſſary to be
knowen; and then I aske fromwhence had they that Faith, without which,
ſcripture is not cleare? Not from ſcripture, becauſe it is prerequired to
the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſcripture. Therfore from ſome other meanes, which
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <pb n="152" facs="tcp:59214:85"/>can be no other, but the Church and tradition.
Beſides this, that is, beſide the ſpirit of God, yea a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d true Faith, they
muſt reade ſcripture daily and attentively, and muſt penetrate the words
and phraſes, which is ſo farr from being eaſy to be done, that he
aſſignes no fewer tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Rules for doeing it, wherof one is, that
we interpret ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture juxta analogiam Fidei, and by the Scriptures
themſelves, by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent conferring of places like to one an other. Is this
eaſy? And yet we muſt not forget, that he ſpeaks of poynts neceſſary
to de believed. Schar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phius aſſignes twenty Rules (in curſu Theologico de
ſcrip: controvers: 8. Pag: 44.) <hi>which vnless they be kept, we cannot but
erre.</hi> But perhaps all theſe Rules are eaſy. Iudg of the reſt by
theſe <hi>To know originall languages; alſo to diſcuſſe the words,
phraſes, and Hebraiſmes: to conferr the places which are like, and vnlike
to one another; to aske adviſe, and to helpe once ſelf with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
&amp;c.</hi> Is this to make the ſcripture eaſy, and evident? Or is it not
to make it evidently true, that it is evident, few can poſſibly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
thoſe Rules, without which, theſe men confess, that ſcripture cannot be
vnderſtood?</p>
               <p n="44">44. And now to proue that I alſo ſpoake truth, in
ſaying, it is evident that theſe Ruls though they were obſerved, are not
ſufficient to make ſcripture cleare and evident, it were abundantly
ſufficient to reflect on the great, and irreconciliable disagreements
amongſt Proteſtants themſelves; which argues, that, either ſcripture is
not evident, or that they are extreamly blind, or malitious, or diſſemble
and ſpea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

belief of their owne hart. Doth not <hi>Chill.</hi> ſay, (Preface N. 30.)
that there is <hi>no more certaine ſigne that a poynt is not evident, than
that honeſt, and vnderſtanding, and indifferent men, and ſuch as giue
themſelues liberty of judgment after a mature conſideration of the matter,
differ about it.</hi> But yet I will proue it out of a Proteſtant, who in
generall brings vnaſwerable arguments againſt the pretented evidence of
ſcripture, and proves in particular, that the Meanes of Rules aſſigned by
Proteſtants, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſcripture, are not ſufficient to
convince or make evident the the ſenſe therof. I meane Dr. Jeremy Taylor in
a <hi>Diſcourſe of the liberty of Prophecying,</hi> printed An: 1647. He
ſect: 3. endeavours to proue in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, the difficulty and vncertainty of
arguments from ſcripture, Firſt <hi>by conſideration of ſcripture it
ſelf in regard of different copies, translations &amp;c. By the many

                     </gap> found out: for, there is in very many
ſcriptures a deuble ſenſe, a litterall, and a ſpirituall: and both
theſe ſenſes are ſubdivided. For, the litterall ſenſe is either
naturall or <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59214:85"/>Figuratiue: and the ſpirituall is ſomtymes
Allegoricall, ſomtymes Anagogicall; nay, ſomtymes there are divers
litterall ſenſes in the ſame ſentence.</hi> This, I ſay, firſt he
proves in generall; and then [Sect: 4.] directly to my purpoſe, he proves
that the meanes which are wont to be aſſigned for interpreting ſcripture
are but vncertaine. Thus he diſcourſes: Firſt, <hi>ſomtyme the
ſenſe is drawne forth by the context and connexion of parts. It is well
when it can be ſo. But when there is two or three antecedents, and
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſpoken of; what man, or what Rule ſhall aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ertaine me, that I make my
reference true, by drawing the relation to ſuch an antecedent, to which I
haue a mynd to apply it, another hath not &amp;c:</hi> Secondly: <hi>An other
great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe is the conference of places;</hi> which he ſayes is of
<hi>ſo indefinite capacity, that, if there be ambiguity of words, variety of
ſenſe, alteration of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or difference of ſtyle amongst
Divine Writers, then there is nothing which may be more abuſed by wilfull
people, or may more eaſily deceive the vnwary, or that may amuſe the moſt
intelligent Obſerver.</hi> This he proves by ſome examples, and ſayes,
that it is <hi>a fallacy a poſſe ad eſſe affirmativè: from a
posſibility of being, to an affirmatiue heing:</hi> that is, becauſe a word
is ſomtymes vſed in ſuch a ſenſe, therfor it muſt alwayes be taken
in that ſenſe; and concludes, that, <hi>this is the great way of
anſwering all the Arguments, that can be brought againſt any thing, that
any man hath a mynd to defend: and any man that reades any controverſyes of
any ſide, ſhall fynd as many inſtances of this vanity, almoſt as he
fynds Arguments from Scripture. This fault was of old noted by S. Auſtin</hi>
[<hi>De Doctrina Chriſtiana. Lib.</hi> 3.] <hi>for then they had got this
trick; and he is angry at it. Ne<expan>

Doctor.</p>
               <p n="45">45. And I ſay in one word: This conferring of divers
places can produce no certainty, vnless you can firſt giue a certaine and
evident Rule, why, and when, this word is to be explicated by that, rather than
that by this; the firſt by the ſecond, rather than the ſecond by the
firſt. But who will dreame, that any ſuch certaine Rule can be given?</p>
               <p n="46">46. Thirdly: Tailor procedes; <hi>Oftentymes Scriptures
are pretended to be expounded by a proportion and Analogy of reaſon.</hi>
This he impugnes at large: and ſaith, <hi>it is with reaſon, as with mens
taſtes. When a man doth ſpeake reaſon, it is but reaſon he ſhould be
heard; but though he may have the good fortune, or the great abilityes to doe
it, yet he hath not a certainty, no regular infallible asſiſtance, no
inſpiration of Arguments and deductions: and <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59214:86"/>if he had,
yet becauſe it muſt be reaſon that muſt judge of reaſon, vnless other
mens vnderſtandings were of the ſame ayre, the ſame conſtitution and
ability, they cannot be preſcribed vnto, by an other mans reaſon;
eſpecially becauſe ſuch reaſonings as vſually are in explication of
particular places of Scripture, depend vpon minute circumſtances and
particularityes, in which it is ſo eaſy to be deceyved, and ſo hard to
ſpeake reaſon regularly and alwayes, that it is the greater wonder if we be
not deceyved.</hi> I may ſay, that, Faith being aboue Reaſon. Reaſon
muſt ſubmit to Faith, and not Faith be ſubject to Reaſon. For, as S.
Bernard excellently ſaies [Ep: 190.] 
<q rend="margQuotes">What is more againſt Reaſon, than
that one ſhould ſtriue to go beyond Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by force of Reaſon?</q>
               </p>
               <p n="47">47. Fourthly: <hi>Others pretend to expound Scripture by
the analogy of Faith.</hi> This he ſayth is but <hi>a chimera, a thing in
nubibus, which varyes like the right hand and left hand of a pillar.</hi> For,
if by the <hi>analogy of Faith be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Rule of Faith,</hi> that
is, <hi>the Creed,</hi> were it not a <hi>fine deviſe to go to expound all
the Scripture by the Creed, there being in it ſo many thouſand places which
haue no more relation to any Article in Creed than they haue to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre tu
patulae? But if you extend the analogy of Faith further than that which is
proper to the rule or Symbol of Faith, then every man expounds Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
according to the analogy of Faith: but what? His own Faith: which Faith if it
be queſtioned, I am no more bound to expound according to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of
another mans Faith, then he is to expound according to the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of myne.
And this is it that is complained on of all ſides
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value their owne
opinions. Scripture ſeemes ſo clearly to ſpeake what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heue, that
they wonder all the world does not ſee as cleare as they do &amp;c:</hi> In
this he ſpeaks what we find by daily experience; and the Reaſon is,
becauſe evident or obſcure, probable or improbable, being but
extrinſecall Denominations (in reſpect of the Objects which are in
themſelves either ſo, or not ſo, Eſt, or Non) taken from the Acts of
our vnderſtanding, which haue great dependance on ſeverall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions,
affections, education, and other prejudices, no wonder if one man judg that to

rectify Tranſlations. But I know no man that ſayes that the Scriptures in
Hebrew and Greek are eaſy and certaine to be vnderſtood, and that they are
hard in Latine and Engliſh. <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59214:86"/>The difficulty is in the
thing however it be expreſſed, the leaſt in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. If the
Originall Languages were our mother tongue, Scripture is not much the eaſyer
to vs; and a naturall Greek or a Iew can with no more reaſon, nor authority,
obtrude his interpretations vpon other mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, than a man of
another Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="49">49. And [Num: 6.] he ſayth in generall: That, <hi>all
theſe wayes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Scripture, which of themſelves are good helps,
are made either by deſigne, or by our infirmityes, wayes of intricating and
involving Scriptures in greater difficulty, becauſe men do not learne their
doctrines from Scripture, but come to the vnderſtanding of Scripture with
preconceptions and ideas of doctrines of their own; and then no wonder that
Scriptures looke like Pictures, wherein every man in the roome believes they
looke on him only, and that wherſoever he ſtands, or how often ſoever he
changes his ſtation. So that now, what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a remedy, becomes
the promoter of our diſeaſe, and our meate becomes the matter of
ſickness: And the miſchiefe is, the wit of man cannot find a remedy for it;
for there is no rule, no limit, no certaine Principle by which all men may be
guided to a certaine and ſo infallible an interpretation, that he can with
any equity preſcribe to others to belieue his interpretations in places of
contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy or ambiguity. Oſiander in his confutation of the Booke which
Melancton wrote againſt him, obſerves, that there are twenty ſeverall
opinions concerning juſtification, all drawn from the Scriptures by the men
only of the Auguſtan Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesſion. There are ſixteen ſeverall opinions
concerning originall ſin; and as many definitions of the Sacraments as there
are ſects of men that diſagree about them.</hi> This makes good what I
ſayd aboue, that the Proteſtants cannot agree in the very definition of
Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Laſtly, (Num: 8.) he concludes thus. <hi>Since,
thoſe ordinary meanes of expounding ſcripture, as ſeurching the
Originalls, conference of places, parity of Reaſon, and analogy of Faith, are
all dubious, vncertaine, and veryfallibe: He that is the wiſeſt, and by
conſequence the likelyeſt to expound trueſt in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of
reaſon, will be very farr from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence; becauſe every one of theſe

amidſt ſo many difficultyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="51">51. I haue thought good to ſet down this diſcourſe,
as being vnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, and making directly for vs againſt the tenet of
Proteſtants, that, the Scripture is evident in all things neceſſary to be
believed; I ſay, even in things neceſſary. For although he giue to his
<hi>Third Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> this <hi>Title (Of the difficulty and vncertainty of
Arguments from Scripture, in Queſtions not ſimply neceſſary, not
litterally determined)</hi> yet it is minifeſt <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59214:87"/>thathis
reaſons either proue vniverſally of all articles, or proue nothing at all:
eſpecially if we conſider, that the moſt neceſſary myſteryes of
Chriſtian Faith, are alſo moſt ſublime: and therfor no wonder, if
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the title to his Third Section, mentioned the <hi>difficulty and
vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts from ſcripture in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ns not ſimply
neceſſary,</hi> in the proofes and proſecution of his reaſons, he is
ſilent of any ſuch diſtinction, and ſhewes not in all, or any one of
his reaſons of the difficulty and vncertainty of the ſenſe of
ſcripture, any difference between neceſſary and vnneceſſary points,
nor is any man able to doe it, vpon any ſolid ground, as will appeare to any
one who will ſeverally conſider his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And when in the ſame
Title he mentions Queſtions not literally determined, I cannot imagine what
he would ſay; ſince according to his reaſons, no Queſtion can literally
be determined in ſuch manner, as ſtill there will not remaine difficulty
and vncertainty, vnless he were content to acknowledg the authority of the
Church for determining ſome particular meaning of Scripture, as the literall
ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe therof. Beſides, vnless he can giue vs a catalogue of queſtions
ſimply neceſſary (which <hi>Chilling:</hi> ſayes, is impoſſible to
be done, and thoſe Proteſtants who haue gone about to doe it, could never
agree amongſt themſelues, nor is it poſſible they ſhould &amp;c:) how
ſhall we know that they are literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined, or that Scripture in them
is evident?</p>
               <p n="52">52. He ſayd, the difficulty ariſes from diverſity
of editions, tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſenſes, literall or ſpirituall, naturall or
figuratiue; the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of conferring places; of parity of reaſon;
analogy of faith; conſulting the originalls. And who can deny, but that
theſe reaſons hold, as well in neceſſary, as vnneceſſary poynts?
Where will he fynd any text of ſcripture (evident, and not ſubject to any
one of thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultyes, which he hath vrged to proue the difficulty of
ſcripture) affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that thoſe meanes and helpes, are inſufficient for
vnneceſſary poynts, ſufficient for neceſſary? If he anſwer: that if
they be not cleare, they cannot be neceſſary: I reply; This is not to proue
out of Scripture, but by reaſon: and he hath told vs, that it is with
reaſon as with mens taſtes: and in our preſent queſtion, his reaſon
wilbe <hi>petitio principij,</hi> a ſuppoſing, that all neceſſary
points are evidently contayned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For if this be not ſuppoſed,
it wilbe ſoone anſwerd, that we may be obliged to belieue articles of
Faith, by meanes of the Church or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, though they be not in particular,
evidently contained in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Doth not the prime Proreſtant Sanchius
by me cited aboue, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59214:87"/>that the ſayd meanes, or
nineteene Rules preſcribed by him, are required for finding out the ſenſe
of Scripture in thoſe things which are neceſſary for ſalvation? Therfor
if theſe meanes be doubtfull and vncertaine, we cannot from Scripture alone
receyue ſufficient certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to belieue with an act of Faith, even things
neceſſary to ſalvation. And indeed, all the meanes which Proteſtants
preſcribe, being humane actions and endeavours, wherin every man is ſubject
to errour; this only remaines certaine, that they can yield vs no certainty. A
deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo cleare, that Whitaker (de Eccleſ. Controv. 2. Q. 4. P. 221.)
ſayes plainly. <hi>Such as the meanes are, ſuch of neceſſity muſt be
the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but the meanes of interpreting dark places are vncertaine,
doubtfull, and ambiguous, therfor it cannot be, but that the interpretation
alſo muſt be vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; then it may be falſe &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="53">53. Eightly: Proteſtants require for interpretation of
Scripture, the ſpirit of God, as we haue ſeene aboue, and [2. Pet. 1. V.
20.21.] it is ſayd; 
<q rend="margQuotes">No prophecy of Scripture is made by
private interpretation, but the holy men of God ſpake, inſpired with the
Holy Ghoſt.</q> And therfor God hath given to his Church the Gift of
interpretation; and I ſuppoſe Proteſtants will not ſay, that the
ſpirit of God, the Grace of God, and the Gift of interpretation given by God,
is neceſſary only for things not neceſſary, and that we can attaine to
the knowledge of poynts neceſſary by our own naturall forces: which yet we
might doe, if reading alone could ſuffice vs for vnderſtanding the true
meaning of all neceſſary Myſteryes of Faith. And it is ſtrange that Dr.
Morton ſhould ſay, (Apolog. part. 2. Lib. 1. Cap. 19.) <hi>That which is
queſtioned, is, whether all ſuch thinges as are neceſsary to ſalvation,
are ſo very plaine, that the moſt vnlearned believers, by the reading
therof, may be inſtructed to piety: and heretiques, though not learned, may
clearly enough be confuted by them:</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he holds the affirmatiue part. And
ſo Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts muſt either confess themſelves to be Pelagians, if they
hold Gods ſpeciall grace and ſpirit not to be neceſſary for
vnderſtanding ſcripture aright; or if they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the neceſſity of
ſuch particular Grace, they muſt yeald, that ſcripture is not evident in
all things neceſſary to be knowne. Which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may be yet inforced in
this manner.</p>
               <p n="54">54. The gift of interpretation is not given to every
private perſon, as we gather from the words of S. Paul (1. Cor: 12.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">To one is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſpirit, the
word of wiſedome; to another the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; to another,
interpretation of languages, to another; prophecy <pb n="158" facs="tcp:59214:88"/>&amp;c:
which declare that the ſpirit of interpreting is not given to all,</q> in
ſo much as Kemnitius (Exam: Part: 1. Fol: 63.) teacheth that the Gift of
Interpretation is not common to all, no more then is the gift of healing and
miracles, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfor we can only be certaine that it is in the Church, not in
any private perſon. Therfor the Scripture is not ſo evident, that we can be
ſure of the meaning therof, by the interpretation of any, but of the
Church.</p>
               <p n="55">55. Which finally Proteſtants muſt either acknowledg,
or els pinfold themſelves in an inextricable circle and labyrinth; in this
manner: Scripture is evident only to thoſe who are indued with the ſpirit
of God and ſeing S. Iohn (Ioan: 1 Cap: 4. V. 1.) warnes vs. 
<q rend="margQuotes">beleeue not every Spirit, but proue the
ſpirits if they be of God,</q> it followes that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants muſt haue
ſome meanes to try this ſpirit, before they can beleeue it; which meanes
with them muſt be only Scripture: and therfor they muſt know the meaning of
the Scripture, before they can make vſe of that ſpirit, by which they are
to know the meaning of the Scripture. Therfor the ſame ſpirit is
neceſſary to know the meaning of Scripture, and Scripture neceſſary to
try the truth of this ſpirit; and ſo this ſpirit ſhalbe neceſſary
for attayning the meaning of Scripture, which meaning of Scripture muſt be
attayned before we can vſe this ſpirit. Therfore this ſpirit is
neceſſary, and not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for vnderſtanding Scripture, which we
muſt vnderſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can try this ſpirit; and Scripture
neceſſary, and not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary for trying this ſpirit, which we
muſt know to be from God before we vnderſtand Scripture. And in a word, the
ſpirit muſt depend on the vnderſtanding of Scripture, and the
vnderſtanding of Scripture muſt depend on the ſpirit; and the finall
concluſion will be, that the ſame thing muſt depend on it ſelfe, the
ſpirit on ſpirit, Scripture on Scripture: and ſo both of them muſt
exiſt both before, and after, themſelves. Neither is there any meanes to
avoyd this Circle, except by having recourſe to Gods viſible Church,
whoſe ſpirit needs no triall of men; ſince God himſelfe hath given a
publike Approbation of Her ſpirit, by obliging all to obey Her voyce, and to
receyue even Scripture it ſelf, from Her Authority and Teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="56">56. Ninthly: I now vrge more in particular, that which
hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I touched in generall: that they can alledg no evident Text of
Scripture, declaring any command that we muſt haue recourſe to 
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59214:88"/>Scripture alone, for knowing the Objects or Articles of
Faith: and yet if the End which is Faith, be neceſſary, the only Meanes
(that is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) to attayne that End, muſt alſo be neceſſary: nor
can they produce any evident Text, proving that from Scripture alone, we can
learne all points neceſſary to be believed.</p>
               <p n="57">57. The cleareſt and moſt effectuall way to proue the
truth of this my Aſſertion, wilbe to examine ſuch Texts as Proteſtants
are wont to alledg, and to ſhew how little they make to their purpoſe. They
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe words (Deut: 4. V. 2.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">You ſhall not add to the word that I
ſpeake to you, neither ſhall you take away from it: keepe the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Lord your God which I command you. Search the Scriptures.
(Ioan: 5.39.) theſe things are written, that yee may beleeue. (Ioan: 20.31.)
And that of the Beraeans: dayly ſearching the ſcriptures. (Act: 17. V. 11.)
we haue the Propheticall word more ſure (2. Pet. 1.19.) All Scripture
inſpired of God, is profitable to teach, to argue, to correct, to inſtruct
in juſtice: that the man of God may be perfect, inſtructed to every good
worke.</q> (2. Timoth: 3.16.)</p>
               <p n="58">58. Now theſe Texts, are ſo farr from proving
evidently what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that it is evident, that neither theſe, nor any
other can be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to proue, that men are obliged to haue recourſe to
ſcripture alone. The reaſon is; becauſe whatſoeuer can be alledged out
of the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot be ſo vnderſtood, as to exclude the living
Guides gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that Church, as Moyſes, the Prophets, and writers of
Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſcripture: nor out of the new teſtament to exclude the
Apoſtles, and preachers of the Goſpell. Therfor no ſcripture can be ſo
vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as to oblige vs to conſult ſcripture alone. Nay out of this
ground I further infer, that, ſeing at that tyme Chriſtians wanted not
living in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Guides, they had no obligation at all to conſult
ſcripture, (and much less ſcripture alone) and if they had no ſuch
obligation, no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical ſcripture can with truth affirme, that they were
ſo obliged, and conſequently it is an injury to ſcripture to interpret it
in that ſenſe. This my deduction is confirmed by a doctrine of
<hi>Chilling.</hi> (Pag: 116. N. 159.) <hi>that, God requires of vs vnder payne
of danatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only to belieue the verityes therin</hi> (in ſcripture)
<hi>contayned, and not the divine authority of the Bookes wherin they are
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d.</hi> By which
aſſertion, he doth not only diſoblige me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recourſe to
ſcripture but alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> believing it to be the word of God when the
contents therof ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be learned by other meanes, as they might, while thoſe
viſible guides were living. Therfor no text ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be brought to 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59214:89"/>proue, that men were, or are, obliged to haue recourſe
to Scripture for matters of Faith, though they are bound to belieue them to be
the infallible word of God, as in due tyme I will proue againſt his
perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious doctrine to the contrary delivered in this ſame page and
number.</p>
               <p n="59">59. But beſide this, there is another fundamentall
ground of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which being well pondered, will make it a hard task
for them to alledge any text of ſcripture to the purpoſe in hand. They
teach, that only after the Canon of ſcripture was perfited, it became a
ſufficient Rule of Faith; and conſequently, before that tyme, we could not
be ſure that all neceſſary points were expreſſed therin. Therfor, do
I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, no ſcripture could affirme, that ſcripture contaynes all
neceſſary poynts, except that book, yea text, which was written laſt, and
did make vp the whole Canon; and all precedent parts of ſcripture could only
ſpeake in the future tenſe, and as it were by way of prophecy, that other
books of ſcripture were to be written; and that then the ſcripture would be
ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for all neceſſary points. For which propheticall kind of
meaning, Proteſtants do not alledg ſcripture; as for example, that the old
Teſtament did prophecy of every book of the New; or, that one part of the new
contaynes a prophecy of the other parts that were to follow; which to affirme,
were groundless and ridiculous. And who can ſay, that the ſcripture which
was written laſt, affirmes the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of ſcripture alone? If
Proteſtants haue any ſuch aſſurance, let them ſhew vs, in that laſt
booke, or text, the words which evidently contayne ſuch a meaning and
aſſeveration. For, on that laſt text alone they muſt rely, for the
reaſons alledged, that, without that text the Canon was not complete. Add yet
further, that, it being not certaine what part of Canonicall ſcripture was
the laſt, they cannot with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty alledg any one text of the whole Bible,
to proue their purpoſe. And much will be added to their difficulty, if we
conſider, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do not agree, whether ſome of thoſe
ſcriptures, which were the laſt, or among the laſt, be Canonicall, or no;
for example, the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips, the ſecond, and third Epiſtle of S. John,
which, by ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are expreſſly put out of the Canon. And
then how can they ſo much as offer vs any proofe from the old Teſtament,
ſince it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be done out of the new, as hath bene
proved.</p>
               <p n="60">60. Tenthly. Although what I haue ſayd, were
ſufficient to ſtop all attempts of Proteſtants, to alledg any text of
ſcripture for their purpoſe; yet for the greater ſatisfaction of the
reader, in a matter of ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59214:89"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I will, as I
ſayd aboue, examine the texts, vſually alledged, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhew, that they are
neither evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor probable, nor pertinent. Wherby I ſhall not only confute
all their proofes, but joyntly bring a convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for vs, againſt
them; whoſe Doctrine muſt needs fall, if they be demonſtrated, to faile
in their allegation of ſcripture for this maine poynt. And it is to be
obſerved, that <hi>Chilling:</hi> ſeemes in effect to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that it
is hard to alledg any effectuall text for his purpoſe, while he is very
ſparing in producing ſcripture, but makes perpetually vſe of Topicall
arguments and diſcourſes; as for example, if ſcripture were not evident
in all things neceſſary, we could not be obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the
like, being indeed conſcious, that the places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commonly
alledged by Proteſtants, are of ſmall force.</p>
               <p n="61">61. To the words objected out of (Deut: 4.2.)

                  <hi>Brierly</hi>
(Tract: 1. ſect. 4. ſubdiviſ: 6.) citing both ancient Fathers, and

of Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phegor (as it followes V. 3.) or of ſome other new Deity or Idoll.
For, Moyſes in all this Chapter, and frequently in deuter: intends to
exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de new Gods, and Rites. Thus the Hebrew al, that is, ad, is taken for
contra, (Pſalm: 2.2.) and numbers (14.2.) ſo (Gal. 1.8.) S. Paul denounces
an anathema to thoſe who evangelize aliud praeter id quod ipſe
evangelizavit; praeter, beſide; that is contra, againſt: for he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of
thoſe who went about to yoyne Chriſtianity with judaiſme. This appeares
in the words of the ſame verſe, <hi>you ſhall not add to the word which I
ſpeak to you; neither ſhall you take away from it: keepe the commandements
of your God, which I command you.</hi> Which latter words ſignify; that to
add, or take away from Gods word, is to breake, or doe ſomthing againſt his

forbidden, and otherwiſe may tend to Gods glory: Otherwiſe the Iewes added
many things to the Law of God, as, engravings, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the temple:
Dayes of lottes, (Eſth. 9.31.) the Feaſt of fire given; the Feaſt of the
Dedication &amp;c. All which conſidered, who doth not ſee what a ſtrange
Argument this is: Moyſes ſayth to the Iewes, thou ſhall not add to the
word which I ſpeake. Therfor nothing muſt be believed or practiſed by
Iewes; or Chriſtians, which is not expreſt in writing, or ſcripture; yea
in the ſcripture of the old Law: and what is this but to condemne the Law of

               <p n="63">63. Toar thoſe words, ſearch the Scriptures, ſpoken
by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Jewes (Joan. 5.39.) I anſwer: firſt; if they will
haue their purpoſe, they muſt add, ſolas, earch the Scriptures alone, (as
Luther, in the Text, where it is ſayd (Rom. 3.28.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">We account a man to be juſtified by
Faith without the works of the Law, in favour of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith
alone,</q> tranſlats, juſtified by Faith alone) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are not
to purpoſe. For the queſtion is only whether ſcripture alone contayne all
things neceſſary to ſalvation. 2. Indeed they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not add, ſolas, nor
can any vnderſtand Search the Scriptures, in that ſenſe of taking
Scriptures alone, ſince our B, Saviour in that Chapter of S. Iohn, to proue
that he was the Meſſias, alledges the teſtimony of S. John Baptiſt: and
a greater teſtimony then John, the very works <pb n="163" facs="tcp:59214:90"/>which I
doe (miracles) and alſo the voyce of his Father. (Matth. 3.17.) Therfor our
Sauiour beſide Scriptures, alledgeth other very powerfull meanes; the voyce
of John; the voyce of works; the voyce of his eternall Father. 3. This Text
ſpeaks only of one Article of Faith, to witt, that Chriſt was the
Meſſias, and it is no good conſequence; the ſcriptures are cleare in
one poynt of Faith: rherfor they are cleare in all. 4. Even for this one Poynt
he doth not abſolutely command them to ſearch the ſcriptures, as
neceſſary of themſelves, but only ex hypotheſi. For, vpon
ſuppoſition that they did not beleeue for the other threefold
teſtimonyes, and that they believed ſcripture to be the word of God, then
it only remayned, that they ſhould ſearch the ſcriptures, and ſo our
Sauiour ſayth, ſearch the ſcriptures, and expreſſly adds, (Joan.
5.39.)

of the Church, and yet belieue ſcriptures, ſearch the ſcriptures, which
giue teſtimony of the Church. And yet it were ſtrang, if Proteſtants
ſhould, from ſuch our daily ſpeech infer, that we belieue no other Rule,
or Judg beſides ſcriptnre alone: and I hope Proteſtants will not deny but
that the teſtimony of S. John, our Sauiours Miracles, and the voice of his
Eternall Father, were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to oblige men to belieue that our Sauiour
was the Meſſias, though they had not ſearcht the ſcriptures; as we
ſee Infidels to be converted to the Faith of Chriſt by Miracles, and other
Arguments of Credibility, without helpe of ſcripture, which they beleeue not
to be the word of God, except by force of thoſe Arguments: and I ſuppoſe
they will grant that our Saviours Miracles, and thoſe other Arguments which
he vſed, were more forcible than any can be brought by any Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
man, for the converſion of Gentils. So that vpòn the matter, this
Text, ſearch the ſcriptures, pondered, as it ſhould be, ſhews not only
that ſcripture alone is not neceſſary, but abſolutely proves, it is not
ſo, but may be ſupplyed by othermeanes, as S. Irenaeus witneſſeth of
people that were converted to the Faith of Chriſt without knowledg of
ſcripture 5. Proteſtants cannot proue that ſcrutamini, ſearch, is 
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59214:91"/>the imperatiue mood. S. Cyrill: Lib. 3. in Joan: Cap: 4.
holds, that it is of the indicatiue; and ſome learned Catholike Divines are
of the ſame mynd; yea Beza ſaith; <hi>I agree with Cyrill who clearly
wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nes vs that this is to be
vnderſtood rather by a verbe of the indicative:</hi> and ſo our Saviour
reprehends the Jewes who did ſearch the ſcriptures and yet did not belieue
in him of whom thoſe ſcriptures ſpoke. According to this Opinion, or
explication of this text, our Saviour in this place, neither commands, nor
forbids, approves, nor diſallowes the reading of ſcripture, but only
ſignifyes, what they did, and ſuppoſing they did ſo, blames them for
not doing it with ſuch a hart and diſpoſition of ſoule, as to find in
them the true Meſſias. At leaſt, ſeing this expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be
evidently diſproved, it is evident, that this text doth not evidently
convince, that the ſcripture alone contaynes evidently all things
neceſſary to ſalvation: yea, rather, ſince thoſe men did read
ſcripture, and yet not belieue in Chriſt, it is a ſigne, that ſcripture
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is not ſo very cleare, as to neceſſitate a mans vnderſtanding to
the true meaning therof, without ſome diſpoſitions on our behalf, of
which diſpoſitions, no man being abſolutely and evidently certaine, he
cannot be certainly aſſured, that he hath attayned the right ſenſe by
ſcripture alone, without ſome other helpe, as was the preaching, and
Miracles of our Saviour and the Teſtimony of s. John, and of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Father; and as to vs, is the Authority, and voyce of Gods Church. But if we
will follow the other opinion, that our Saviour commanded thoſe men to reade
the ſcriptures, it cannot be vnderſtood as an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute command (ſeing
they had other meanes more than ſufficient, and more effectuall than
ſcripture, to beget in their ſoules a belief that Chriſt was the
Meſſias: to witt, Miracles, voyce of his Father &amp;c:) but only, as I
ſayd, vpon ſuppoſition, that they by their owne fault, not making vſe
of thoſe other meanes, were obliged to make vſe of this of ſcripture; yet
ſo, as they might free themſelves from that hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and voluntary
neceſſity, by applying themſelves to thoſe other meanes, for neglect of
which, our Saviour reprehends them [V. 38.] 
<q rend="margQuotes">His (the Fathers) word you haue not
remayning in you, becauſe whom he hath ſent, him you beleeue not:</q> (and
yet they believed the ſcripture) and this reprehenſion he proſecutes to
the end of that Chapter. The obligation then of ſearching ſcripture was
voluntary, and the command only to Jewes, and Jewes ſo incredulous, that they
would neither belieue s. John, nor our Saviour Chriſt, nor the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall 
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59214:91"/>Father. And if Proteſtants will imitate thoſe Jewes,
and reject all Authority of a living Guide, and rely only on ſcripture, they
for finding the true Church, ſhalbe obliged to ſearch ſcriptures, by a
vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary culpable neceſſity, which they ought not to impoſe vpon
others, but contrarily, they ought by all poſſible meanes, to free
themſelves from it, by ſubmitting to Gods Church, and her Preachers, as
ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations haue done before they knew ſcripture, and in that caſe
were obliged to attend to other Motives and Meanes; and ſo thete is a far
more vniverſall and neceſſary command to Heare the Church, than to
ſearch the ſcriptures. 6. Our Saviour ſpoke only of the Old Teſtament.
And ſhall we out of his words infer, that in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, all
Articles of Chrſtian Faith are particularly and evidently contayned? This
Objection then proves too much, and therfor indeed proves nothing. 7.
Scrutamini, ſearch, ſignifyes diligence, care, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, labour, which
rather declare the difficulty and obſcurity, than the facility and evidence
of Scripture. For, what great paynes and induſtry can be required, to fynd
out that which is evident? And therfor S. Chryſoſtome ſayth, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that our Saviour remitted the Jewes not
to a ſimple and bare reading of the ſcripture, but to a very diligent
ſearch therof: For, he did not ſay; Reade the ſcriptures, but ſearch.
And Euthymius ſayth; He bids them digg more deeply into them, that they may
fynd out thoſe thinges which are deeply layd vp ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in like a
treaſure.</q> How then is it evident, that Scrutamini ſignifyes evidently,
that all things neceſſary are cleare in ſcripture alone? And yet we
muſt remember, that our B. Saviour, ſpoke thoſe words, in order to the
greateſt and moſt eſſentiall Article of Chritian Faith, to witt, that
Jeſus Chriſt is the true Meſſias: about which Poynt, the Eunuch [Act:
8.34.] 
<q rend="margQuotes">had need that Philip ſhould interpret
Eſay vnto him: I beſeech thee, of whom doth the Prophet ſpeak this? Of
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or of ſome other? To which purpoſe, S. Hierome to S. Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
ſayth of this Eunuch: So great a lover of the Law and of divine knowledg was
he, that even in the chariot he read holy ſcriptures. And yet when he had the
book in his hands, and conceyved our Lords words in his thoughts, repeated them
with his tongue, ſounded them with his lipps, he was ignorant of him whom he
worſhipped vnknowen, though yet it were hee of whom the booke did
ſpeake</q>. And [Luk, 24.27.] the diſciples ſtood in need that Chriſt
ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret vnto them in all ſcriptures which were concerning him.
What <pb n="166" facs="tcp:59214:92"/>greater Myſtery than this concerning Chriſt
himſelf, and how was it evident in Scripture, when even the Diſciples, who
were brought vp in the Schoole of Chriſt, vnder ſuch a Maiſter; whoſe
Divine words they heard, and ſaw his admirable works and Miracles, did not
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it? How many wayes is this Objection againſt Proteſtants, and
nothing at all againſt vs?</p>
               <p n="63">63. Neither will they gaine any more by thoſe words
(Joan. 20.31.) which <hi>Chilling.</hi> alſo objects (Pag. 211. N. 42.)
<hi>Theſe are written, that you may beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt is the Son
of God: and that beleeving, you may haue life in his name.</hi> For, Firſt;
what makes this to the purpoſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that we are obliged to rely on
ſcripture alone, for all matters of Faith? In theſe words there is no
command even to reade S. Iohns Goſpell; but they only declare the end, and
occaſion, which moved him to write it, namely, to confute the Ebionite
Heritiks, and proue that Ieſus is the ſon of God; which makes good what I
ſayd herto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Evangeliſts did not purpoſely intend to deliver
all things neceſſary to ſalvation, or make a Catechiſme, but wrote
according to ſeverall different occaſions, as now we ſee, that if the
Ebionites had not taught that wicked Hereſy, S. Iohn had not written his
Goſpell. And therfor; 2. This Text ſpeaks of one Point only, not of all
Articles of Faith. 3. S. Iohn ſpeaks only of his owne Goſpell, and
<hi>Chilling.</hi> holds it only for probable, that every one of the Goſpells
contaynes all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Points; and therfor no certainty can be taken from
theſe words, that Scripture contaynes all things neceſſary. 4. Even for
this one Poynt of Faith S. Iohn ſayes not, that his Goſpell is evident,
excluding the Authority of Gods Church, and her Paſtours; yea he carefully
relates our Saviours words to S. Peter (Ioan. 21.17.) Feed my ſheep: and we
ſee, for want of ſubmitting to ſuch Authority, <hi>Chilling.</hi> and
other Socinians deny that, for which s. Iohn wrote his Goſpell, that Ieſus
is the true ſonne of God. 5. In the Text; Theſe things are written that you
may belieue &amp;c. s. Iohn ſpeaks not of the doctrine taught, but of the
Miracles wrought by our Saviour Chriſt: and therfor we muſt, if this
Objection were of any force, ſay, that all things neceſſary to
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, are evidently contayned in that part, or thoſe words, and lines
of his Goſpell, which preciſely recount our Savionrs Miracles: which to
imagine, is ridiculous, and abſurd. Now that s. Iohn ſpeaks of our Saviours
Miracles, is confeſſed by Whitaker, as a thing evident (de ſcripttur. Q.
5. P. 619.) ſaying; <hi>It is evident that the Evangeliſt ſpeakes of 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59214:92"/>the ſignes and Miracles of Chriſt, not of his
Doctrine.</hi> The Proteſtant Bible ſayth, <hi>Many other ſignes truly
did Ieſus in the preſence of his Diſciples, which are not written in this
booke. But theſe are written, that ye might belieue that Ieſus is the
Chriſt the Son of God.</hi> Where we ſee, theſe are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, is referred
to the ſubſtantiue which went before, that is, ſignes; and it appeares
alſo by reflecting on the Antitheſis which he makes betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not written,
and wtitten: Many are not written, which he ſayes of ſignes (many other
ſignes truly did Ieſus, which are not writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) and then adds: but theſe
are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfor writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and not written fall vpon the ſame thing. But
not written did relate to ſignes or miracles; Therfor written muſt be
refered to the ſame. <hi>Chilling:</hi> himſelf [Pag: 211. N. 42.] ſaith;
By, <hi>Theſe are written, may be vnderſtood, either theſe things are
written, or theſe ſignes are written.</hi> And then, what conſequence is
this; S. Iohn wrote ſome Miracles of our Saviour Chriſt, that men might
belieue him to be the ſon of God: Therfor all neceſſary Points of Faith
are evident in ſcripture, or in S. Iohns Goſpell taken alone? And he doth
but play the Sophiſter, to deceyue ſome ſimple Reader when out of S.
Iohns words (in the ſame Pag. 211. N. 42.) he infers, that, <hi>All that
which S. Iohn wrote in his Goſpell, was ſufficient to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that which being beleeved with liuely Faith, would certainly bring them to
Eternall Life.</hi> For, a lively Faith, or a Faith working by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, muſt
include not only that one Article, (Ieſus is the ſon of God) but all other
Myſteryes of Faith, togeather with the keeping of all Commandements belonging
to Charity, and other Vertues; and it may be ſayd of any leaſt Poynt of
Faith, that it <hi>being believed with a lively Faith, will certainly
bring</hi> the believer <hi>to Eternall life;</hi> becauſe a lively Faith,
involves all other neceſſary Poynts of Faith, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And his
ſilent leaping from Faith alone, (yea from one only Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith alone)
to a lively Faith, demonſtrates that the believing of that Poynt alone,
Ieſus is the ſon of God, is not ſufficient for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vnless it be
joyned with the belief of other Points belonging both to Faith, and Manners,
and with obſervation of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; which he will never proue to be
evidently contayned in the ſcripture alone, and much less in the Goſpell of
S. Iohn alone: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more ſhall be ſayd herafter. In the meane tyme, take
for your Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe wholeſome words of <hi>S: Auſtine de vnit:
Eccl: Cap:</hi> 4. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever belieue that Ieſus Chriſt is the ſon
of God, yet ſo diſſent from his Body, which is the Church, as their
Communion is not with the whole <pb n="168" facs="tcp:59214:93"/>whereſoever it is
ſpred, but is found ſeparate in ſome parte, it is manifeſt, that they
are not in the Catholik Church.</hi> Therefore it is not ſufficient for
ſalvation, only to belieue, that Chriſt is the ſonne of God.</p>
               <p n="64">64. The example of men of Beroea (Act: 17. V, 11.) who
were ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcriptures, if theſe things were ſo, is of no
force, in many res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. Firſt Heere is no leaſt inſinuation of any
vniverſall precept to reade or ſearch the ſcriptures, but only a
narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of what thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did: and if the fact of ſome, may be alledged,
as a command for all to reade the ſcriptures, why may not the example of
others, who belieued only by hearing S. Paule, and the other Apoſtles preach,
and ſeeing them worke Miracles, and propoſe excellent reaſons and
arguments of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>bility,
be alledged for a command, that men ſhould belieue without delaying their
converſion, till they reade ſcriptures? Secondly; they did not ſearch the
ſcriptures with any intention to find all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Myſteryes of
Chriſtian Faith evidently expreſſed in them, which is our queſtion, but
only that mayne poynt which was preached to them by S. Paule, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that this is Jeſus Chriſt whom I
preach to you.</q> (V. 3) other particular poynts, they would eaſily learne
by further inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apoſtles, being once aſſured in
generall, that they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons worthy of all credit, and Meſſengers of
God. Thirdly; The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which they did ſearch, were the Bookes of the
Old teſtament; in which, all the neceſſary particular poynts of
Chriſtian Faith are not evidently contayned, ſince Proteſtants teach,
that all neceſſary poynts are contayned in ſcripture, only after the
whole Canon of the Bible was ended: yea, the word ſearching, ſhewes, that
euen that article of the true Meſſias was not evidently contayned in the
Old teſtament; but that the finding of it required labour; as in the like
caſe I ſhewed aboue out of S. Chriſſoſtome, and others, about the
word ſcrutamini, ſearch. Fourtly; Although the ſearch of ſcriptures,
and conſonance of them with s. Paules wordes, might help the converſion of
thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet who can doubt, but the preaching, and viva vox,
interpretation, and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſcripture, alledged, vrged, and
illuſtrated by S. Paul, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo cooperate, and operate more then the only
reading of ſcriptures, which many did reade, and yet were not converted?
Which ſhewes their obſcurity, even in this Fundamentall Article, concerning
the Meſſias, as we reade (Act. 13.27.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Not knowing him, nor the voyces of the
prophets that are read every ſabboth. And (Luc. 24.44.45.) it is ſayd.
Theſe are the words which I ſpake to you when I was <pb n="169" facs="tcp:59214:93"/>with you, that all things muſt needs be fulfilled which are written
in the Law of Moyſes, and the Prophets, and the Pſalmes of me. Then he
opened their vnderſtanding, that they might vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the
ſcriptures.</q> Wherfor the example of the Beroeans is not to the purpoſe,
vnless it can be proved, that they redd the ſcripture, without the
aſſis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſuch other meanes, as I haue mentioned; and that they
found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ident,
that they needed no other help; which certainly is wholy impoſſible to be
proved. Even Cartwright (in whitg. Def. P. 784.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, that
<hi>Vnless the Lord workes miraculouſly and excraordinarily, the bare reading
of the ſcriptures, without the preaching, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deliver ſo much as one
poore sheepe from deſtruction;</hi> Therfor ſcripture is not evident in all
neceſſary Poynts; otherwiſe it might deliver men from deſtruction.
Fiftly: I ſay that not only thoſe men had no obligation to read the
ſcripture, before they believed S. Paul, but (as the rhemes teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon
this place wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves) they were bound to belieue the Apoſtle, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
obey his word, whether he alledged ſcripture, or no; or whether they could
reade and vnderſtand it, or no. Therfor this example cannot be alledged to
proue, that all neceſſary Poynts of Faith are evident in ſcripture alone.
Sixtly: This example is wholy impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if the Beroeans did ſearch the
ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only for their greater comfort a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d confirmation in the Faith
which they had already embraced by the preaching of S. Paul, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not by
ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſcriptures; as Cornelius à Lapide holds, and to that
purpoſe alledges the Text itſelf, which ſayth: (V. 11.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">And theſe were more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
that are at Theſſalonica, who receyved the word with all greediness, daily
ſearching the ſcriptures, if theſe things were ſo.</q> Where, firſt
it is ſayd, they receyved the word, and then, were ſearching the
ſcriptures: And this alſo is the judgment of the Rhemes Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
               <p n="65">65. Beſides the places which I haue anſwered,
Proteſtants are wont to alledg the words of the Apocalyps (22. V. 18.19.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">I teſtify to every one hearing the
words of the prophecie of this Booke, If any man ſhall add to theſe things,
God ſhall add vpon him the plagues writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this book. And if any man
ſhall diminiſh of the word of the book of this prophecy, God ſhall take
away his part out of the book of life, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out of the holy citie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of
theſe things that be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this booke.</q> But what is this to the
purpoſe of proving, that we are obliged to reade, and ſeek out of the
Apocalyps alone (for of it only, S. Iohn expreſſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf to
ſpeake) all neceſſary Poynts of Chriſtian Faith; or that it contaynes
evidently all ſuch points in particular? So farr was <pb n="170" facs="tcp:59214:94"/>this ſacred booke from having been written for a Catechiſme, or an
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Rule of Faith, that it is a Prophecy or revelation of things to come,

<q rend="margQuotes">Tot ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta quot verba; Every

ſuch, as either would add any thing contrary to this book, or corrupt it, by
fathering on it ſome apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall writing, or Revelation, or diminiſh it by
ſome part, or, which is worſt of all, quite aboliſh it as not Canonicall,
as in old tyme, Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtae, Alogiani, Theodoſiani, as witneſſeth
Epiphan: (Lib. 2. Hereſ. 51.) did; And Eraſmus, Lutherus, Brentius, and
Kemnitius, doe. The Author of the Commentary vpon this booke, bearing the name
of S. Ambroſe, ſaith; that, 
<q rend="margQuotes">He curſes Heretikes that vſed to

were contrary to their Hereſyes.</q> But God forbid, we ſhould interpret
Him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Authority of the Church and lawfull Paſtours, ſince S.
John himſelf, as long as he lived, was a Living Rule, or Iudg for matters of
Faith, beſides the word written in the Apocalyps, or in other Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ſcripture: and ſo no ſcripture was then the only Rule of Faith. Yea, S.
John after the ſayd curſe, adds two verſes more; and Cornel. a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide
(Queſt. Proaemialib. in Apocalypſim) ſaith: 
<q rend="margQuotes">it is cleare, that S. John wrote the
Apocalyps before he wrote the Goſpell:</q> For, this he wrote being retourned
from his baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Patmos, (where he wrote the Apocalyps) as S. Hierome
teaches in Catal. ſcript. Eccleſiaſt. and Euſebius (Lib. 5. Hiſt. C.
24.) and S. Auſtine, and Bede, Proaemio in Evangelium S. Ioannis. Kemnitius
alſo (Exam. Pag. 202.) confeſſes that S. John wrote his Goſpell after
the Apocalyps. And Cornel. a Lapide (Proaem. in Epiſt. 1. S. Joannis)
ſpeaking of S. Johns three Epiſtles, ſayth; 
<q rend="margQuotes">It ſeemes that he wrote them about
the ſame tyme that he wrote the Goſpell.</q> By which account, they were
written after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps. Therfor that curſe in the Apocalyps cannot be
ſo vnderſtood, as to exclude all other writings after it.</p>
               <p n="66">66. But the chiefeſt place which Proteſtants are wont
to alledg for the ſufficiency of ſcripture alone, is that of S. Paul, (2.
Timoth. 3. V. 16.17.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">All ſcripture inſpired of God, is
profitable to teach, to argue, to correct, to inſtruct in juſtice: that the
man of God may be perfect, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to every good worke.</q> I anſwer:
Firſt; Speaking in rigour. Profitable; Neceſſary; ſufficient; are
things both different, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A thing may be profitable, and not
neceſſary; and a thing may be <pb n="171" facs="tcp:59214:94"/>both profitable, and
neceſſary for ſome effect, and yet not ſufficient alone to produce it.
Every line in Gods word is profitable, but not every line is either
neceſſary or ſufficient. Our queſtion is, whether ſcripture alone be
ſufficient. The text alledged, ſaith only, that it is profitable; but
ſaith not, that it is either, neceſſary, or ſufficient. Therfor (if we
conſider this place alone) Faith may be conceyved without any ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
becauſe ſcripture heer is not ſayd to be neceſſary; and cannot be
conceyved by ſcripture alone, becauſe ſcripture is not ſayd to be
ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And then the argument comes to be retorted, in this manner. That
which is no more than profitable, is neither neceſſary, nor ſufficient;
but in the text alledged, (which Proteſtants bring as ſufficient to proue
the ſufficiency of ſcripture) ſcripture is only ſayd to be profitable.
Therfor it is neither neceſſary, nor ſufficient.</p>
               <p n="67">
                  <q rend="margQuotes">67. Secondly. The words precedent to
this text, are theſe: but thou continue in thoſe things which thou haſt
learned, and are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thee: knowing of whom thou haſt learned: and
becauſe from thine infancie thou haſt knowen the holy ſcriptures, which
can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thee to ſalvation, by the Faith which is in Chriſt
Jeſus.</q> By which words it appeares, that the ſcripture of which S. Paul
ſpeakes, is the Old teſtament, which alone, Timothy from his infancy had
kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, and which could inſtruct him to ſalvation. And therfor if this
Objection be good, the Old teſtament, taken alone, wilbe ſufficient for
ſalvation: and, if it be a good conſequence, ſcripture is profitable to
inſtruct; therfor it is neceſſary, and ſufficient: the Old teſtament,
which could inſtruct Timothy to ſalvation, muſt be neceſſary and
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, even for theſe tymes: or, if they were ſufficient for
thoſe, but not for theſe our tymes, and that it be cleare that S. Paul
ſpoke of thoſe tymes, and only of the Old teſtament, as is confeſſed
by Henoch Clapham, Aretius, Zwinglius, Hooker, and Ochinus: as may be ſeene
triple Cord. (Chap. 7. Sect, 5.) with what conſcience can they apply that
text to vs, as if the ſcripture of which that text ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, did ſignify
the ſcriptures both of the Old, and New teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Nay, ſeing S. Paul
wrote that Epiſtle to Timothy about forry yeares before the Canon of
ſcripture was perfited, and that Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants affirme that a living Iudg
was neceſſary till the Canon was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, it followes, that the text
whith they alledg, cannot ſignify, that at that tyme, the ſcripture alone
was either neceſſary (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was then a living Iudg which could
determine all <pb n="172" facs="tcp:59214:95"/>Controverſyes) or ſufficient, (becauſe
the Canon was not finiſhed) And therfor although it were granted that the Old
Teſtament (which was perfited) had alone beene evident in all neceſſary
poynts, and therby ſufficient for the Jewes, yet the ſcripture of the New
Teſtament, being not perfited when S. Paul wrote theſe words, it doth not
follow, that they can ſignify their ſufficiency for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. As
Hooker (Eccleſ. Polit. Firſt Booke, N. 14. Pag. 43.) ſayth: <hi>When the
Apoſtle affirmed vnto Timo thy, that the Old was able to make him wiſe to
ſalvation</hi> (2. Timoth. 3.15.) <hi>it was not his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that the Old
alone can do this vnto vs which liue ſithence the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the
New.</hi> Mark how this great man amongſt Proteſtants, affirmes, that S.
Paul ſpeaks only of the Old ſcripture, and that this alone is not
ſufficient for Chriſtians: which he proves, becauſe the Apoſtle
ſayth, that thoſe ſcriptures were able to make Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy wiſe through
the Faith which is in Chriſt. (V. 15.) And this appeares alſo by the words
of S. Paul ſaying to Timothy in the ſame Chapter, (V. 10.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">But thou haſt attayned to my
doctrine, inſtitution, &amp;c. And afterward: But thou continue in thoſe
things which thou haſt learned, and are committed to thee, knowing of whom
thou haſt learned.</q> That is, of S. Paul his Maiſter. Where we ſee,
that S. Paul did not ſend his ſcholler to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone, but to his owne
Inſtitution, Doctrine, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and things committed to him by
word of mouth, or to ſcripture taken togeather with an infallible Living
Iudg: and ſo the Objection proves what we teach, and overthrowes the doctrine
of Proteſtants.</p>
               <p n="68">68. Thirdly. Proteſtants muſt ſhew, that all things
neceſſary are evidently contayned in ſcripture; and this they muſt
proue, by ſome evident Text. For, if it be not evident, the matter will
ſtill remayne vncertayne. But this Text, on which they chiefly rely, is not
evident: Therfor it is not ſufficient to proue that which they intend, and
vpon which, the whole Fabricke of their Faith depends. The minor (That this
Text is not evident) is evidently proved, becauſe it is impoſſible to
ſhew evidently, that profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in this Text, ſignifyes neceſſary; or
if that were freely granted, it will remayne more than impoſſble to proue,
that profitable, or neceſſary, muſt in this Text, ſignify ſufficient.
For by what Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Logick, or Divinity, can any dreame this to be feceable 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59214:95"/>The like I ſay of the words; All ſcripture; which they
interpret not to ſignify every part, or Book of Scripture; but the whole body
of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ſcripture taken togeather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wheras Bellarm. de Verbo Dei,
Lib: 4. Cap: 10. ſaith truly: 
<q rend="margQuotes">In the judgment of all that
vnderſtand latin,</q> that which is ſayd of all ſcripture inſpired of
God, is of ſayd every booke 
<q rend="margQuotes">which is inſpired of God.</q>
Beſide, the Apoſtle by this Vniverſall propoſition, that all
ſcripture is inſpired by God, proves, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular ſcripture is
profitable, and that the ſcripture of the Old Teſtament, which Timothy had
knowen from his infancy, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to inſtruct him to ſalvation. And
therfor as every part of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is inſpired, ſo alſo is it
profitable. And this is more cleare accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Proteſtant Englſh
Tranſlation (Anno 1611. and 1622.) and Greeke Text; <hi>All Scripture is
given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine &amp;c:</hi>
Where we ſee, that of the ſame thing, or ſubject, and by the ſame word
(ſcripture) it is ſayd that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, and that it is proſitable.
Therfor as every part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is inſpired, ſo is it alſo
profitable. And what an incongruous change of ſenſe were it of the ſame
word, All Scripture, that is, every part of Scripture is inſpired; and, all
Scripture, that is, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the whole body of Scripture is profitable? How then
will they be able to proue, much less to proue evidently, that the words, All
Scripture, muſt be certainly taken in this ſenſe? And yet till they doe
this, they haue done nothing for their purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="69">69. Fourthly. We muſt alſo conſider, to whom S.
Paul avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Scripture to be even profitable: Which is not to every
vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perſon, but that the man of God may be perfect: wherby is to be
vnderſtood a Doctour, and Biſhop, as Corn: a Lapide affirmeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this
place, and (In 1. Timoth: Cap: 6. V. 11. where S. Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy is called Homo Dei,
the man of God) proves it out of S. Chriſoſt: and Theodoret, that men
eminently holy, are called men of God: as Prophets are ſo called; 4. Reg:
1.11. &amp; 12. Elias is called the man of God and Samuel 1. Reg: 9. The like
we ſee Judic: 12.6. and 3. Reg: 13.1. It is alſo a title of Kings, Princes,
and Prelates ſo Moyſes Deut: 13.1. is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Homo Dei, man of God; and
David 2. Paral: 8.14. Now, Timothy was a Doctour, Biſhop, and Prince of the
Church of Epheſus. This is alſo the interpretation of Beza. To thoſe then
who are ſuppoſed to be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy well inſtructed by other teachers, the
Scripture is very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that is, not Scripture alone, but joyned with
tradition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59214:96"/>of Gods Church. A paralel to
this of S. Paul, 
<q rend="margQuotes">All ſcripture inſpired of God; is
the Text of S. Peter (Ep: 2. C. 1. 20.21.) Vnderſtanding this firſt, that
no prophecy of ſcripture is made by private interpretation. For, not of mans
will was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy brought at any tyme; but the holy men of God ſpake,
inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Holy Ghoſt. If Heretiques did confider and practiſe
this primum, firſt, that all prophecy is not made by private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation;
For not by mans will, &amp;c:</q> they would not be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, but would
ſee to whom ſcripture is profitable; not to thoſe who will admitt no
Guide, nor interpretation, but their own witt and will: to whom it becomes (by
their only fault) not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but pernicious, as experience tells vs. So
far is it from being neceſſary or ſufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="70">70. Thus their Chiefeſt proofes out of ſcripture,
being clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, it remaynes demonſtrated, that they haue no ſolid
proofe, that Scripture alone contaynes all things neceſſary to Salvation.
But yet let vs alledg ſome more Arguments to diſproue their Tenet.</p>
               <p n="71">71. Eleaventhly. Seing Proteſtants cannot proue out of
ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that ſcripture is evident for all neceſſary poynts, this
alone is ſufficient to overthrow their Aſſertion and Religion. But for
the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and obſcurity of ſcripture, we haue alledged evident
ſcripture, even in a poynt moſt neceſſary concerning the Meſſias,
in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Eunuch, and the Apoſtles themſelves: which
difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is further moſt clearly teſtifyed by S. Peter, who
expreſſly writes thus (2. Pet: 3.15.16.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">As alſo our moſt deare brother Paul
according to the wiſdome given him, hath written to you. As alſo in all
Epiſtles ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in them of theſe things, in the which are certayne
things hard to be vnderſtood, which the vnlearned and vnſtable depraue, as
alſo the reſt of the ſcriptures to their owne perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</q> In which
words I obſerue: Firſt, that as by reaſon of the hardness of ſome
things in S. Paules Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did erre, ſo they did erre alſo in the
reſt of the ſcriptures, for the ſame reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; which ſhewes, that other
ſcriptures contayne things hard to be vnderſtood. Secondly. That thoſe
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did erre in neceſſary poynts, ſeing their errours were cauſe of
their deſtruction. Therfor the ſcripture is hard and obſcure in
neceſſary matters. For, an errour cannot be damnable vnless the contrary
truth be neceſſary. The tranſlatour of the Engliſh bible Ann: 1600.
(Preface) avoucheth, that it is, A very <pb n="175" facs="tcp:59214:96"/>hard thing to
vnderſtand the holy ſcriptures; and that divers errours, ſects, and
hereſies grow daily for lacke of true knowledg therof. Mark that he ſpeaks
of matters of moment, in which to erre, is to fall into Hereſy.</p>
               <p n="72">72. Twelfthly. I take an Argument from theſe your owne
words, (Pag. 54. N. 4.) <hi>If men did really and ſincerly ſubmitt their
judgments to Scripture, and that only, and would require no more of any man but
to do ſo, it were impoſſible but that all Controverſies, thouching
things neceſſary and very profitable, ſhould be ended: and if others were
continued or incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſed, it were no matter.</hi> In which words you ſeeme
te extend the ſole ſufficiency and evidence of ſcripture to things very
profitable. For if theſe be not evidently contayned in ſcripture, how can
you ſay, it were impoſſible but that all controverſies touching them
ſhould be ended; ſince obſcurity or want of evidence, is that which
produces all Controverſyes? Beſides, you ſay, that if Controverſyes in
things not neceſſary, or not very profitable, were continued, or
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, it were no matter. Therfor a contrario ſenſu, it imports that
Controverſyes about things very profitable, be ended. But this ſaying of
yours demonſtrates, how little credit you deſerue in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming all things
neceſſary to be evidently contayned in ſcripture alone, ſince you teach
the ſame of things very profitable, which are ſo far from being all
contayned evidently in ſcripture, that for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Reaſon for the
contrary, we need no other proofe then manifeſt Experience, and contentions
of Proteſtants among themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning many poynts which they
expreſſly declare to be of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; as for example, the Canon of
ſcripture it ſelf; and, How it is knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the word of God; the
infallibility of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Faith; the Euchariſt, Predeſtination;
Free-will; vniverſall Grace; Repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; Definition, neceſſity, effect of
Sacraments; Government of the Church; and other poynts: and yet in Charity,
whoſe <hi>eſſentiall Character is to judg and hope the beſt,</hi> as
you ſay (Pag. 34. N 6.) I ſuppoſe you will not judg, but that all thoſe
your brethren; at leaſt divers of them, <hi>do really and ſincerely
ſubmitt their judgments to ſcripture,</hi> and ſeing it is manifeſt,
that they do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, I ſee no remedy but that you muſt confess
ſcripture alone not to be evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor ſufficient in all things very
profitable. If then, even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your owne words aboue recited, it
import that there be ſome evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d certaine meanes to end Controverſies
touching things very profitable, and that this cannot be done by ſcripture
alone, it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59214:97"/>a living Guide. Beſides, what
evident text of ſcripture can you produce to proue, that it alone is evident
in all things very profitable? And your Reader wilbe glad to know what you
meane by things very profitable and; whether you intend to diſtinguiſh them
from things profitable; and whether your meaning be, that ſcripture alone, is
cleare for things very profitable, but not for poynts only profitable: and if
you anſwer affirmatively; then you wilbe obliged to informe vs, how we may be
able to diſtinguiſh ſo evidently between very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and only
profitable things, as that we may certainly know, what muſt be clearly
contayned in ſcripture, what not. But it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for you to giue
any ſuch intelligible, ſolid, practicall diſtinction, and therfore you
cannot affirme, that all very profitable poynts, are evident in ſcripture,
but not things only profitable. Since then, you cannot ſay, that al
profitable things are evident in ſcripture (for, that were to affirme that
all ſcripture is cleare, there being nothing revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God, which is not
profitable, and yet who will deny but that the ſcripture is obſcure in
ſome poynts?) you muſt be content to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all very profitable
things are not evidently contayned in ſcripture. And further, wheras you
joyne togeather things neceſſary, and things very profitable, and
aſſigne the ſelfsame meanes for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all controverſies concerning
thoſe two kinds of things (which is, really and ſincerely to ſubmitt
their judgments to ſcripture, and that only) ſeing this means will not
ſerue for ending all controverſies in things very profitable, (as I haue
ſhewed) it followes, that it is not ſufficient to end all controverſies
concerning things neceſſary. And if in things profitable, and very
profitable, that may ſeeme evident to one, which to another may ſeeme
obſcure, or even vntrue; the ſame alſo may happen in things
neceſſary, in regard that all the Rules, and induſtryes, which
Proteſtants aſſigne for finding the true ſenſe of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are
no less fallible in things neceſſary, than in things very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. But
whatſoever your opinion be concerning things very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or profitable,
I take thence a ſtrong argument, and ſay.</p>
               <p n="73">73. 13: Not only for things neceſſary, but for things
profitable alſo, there cannot be wanting in Gods Church ſome meanes to end
contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies touching them, by declaring them with certainty, and
infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. For although, if things profitable be taken in particular, and
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, every one is no more than profitable; yet ſpeaking of a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, or a great Miſticall body (eſpecially ſuch a body as the
Church <pb n="177" facs="tcp:59214:97"/>of Chriſt is, inſtituted by an infinite
wiſdome, and ordayned to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime End of Eternall Happyness; toward the
attayning wherof, every little advantage and help is not to be litle
eſteemed, and the privation and want therof, or euery errour therin, is to be
in like proportion, avoyded) things profitable taken as it were in generall,
ought in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſideration to be judged neceſſary in ſuch a body,
which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would looke like a man conceyved with his Eſſence only,
deveſted of all accidents, and integrant parts: or like to his body indued
with neceſſary parts only, for example, hart and braine, without feete,
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, eares, eyes, and other ſenſes. And therfor it cannot be imagined,
but that God hath left meanes in his Church for declaring truths, and
determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Controverſyes in profitable poynts, as occaſion ſhall
require. The ſcripture of it ſelf is moſt ſacred, and effectuall to the
converſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and convincing of Heretikes, if it be redd with
ſobriety, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted with ſubmiſſion of our vnderſtanding to
Gods Church. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, Experience ſhewes, that, men from it (by the fault
of men, not of it) take occaſion of implacable and endless contentions,
without any poſſibility of remedy, till they ſubmitt their judgments, and
will, to ſome infallible Living Guide. For this cauſe alſo their Faith
and Religion is ſterill and barren, as being deprived of Gods bleſſing
for the converſion of nations to Chriſt, fortold by the Prophets, as a
Priviledge of the true Church. Thus, the very name of Chriſt, preached by
ſome who were out of the Church, was not efficacious to the caſting out of
divells, (Act. 19.15.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">yea contrarily, the divell ſo
prevayled againſt them that they fled out of that houſe naked and
wounded.</q> (V. 16.) Even ſo the ſcripture out of the Church, is neither
effectuall for concord among Chriſtians, nor for the converſion of Infidels
to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="74">74. 14. What I haue ſayd about the neceſſity of
profitable things, conſidered as it were in generall, and conſequently, of
ſome meanes to determine controverſyes concerning them, may be confirmed by
a diſcourſe of yours (Pag. 9. N. 6.) where you ſay; <hi>VVe are bound by
the loue of God, and loue of Truth, to be Zealous in the defence of all Truths
that are any way profitable,</hi> (Mark <hi>any way,</hi> and not only <hi>Very
profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,) though not ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation. Or as if any
good man could ſatisfy his conſcience without being ſo affected and
reſolved. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf having aſſured vs (Matth.</hi> 5.19:)
<hi>That he that ſhall break one of his leaſt Commandements (ſome wherof
you pretend are concerning veniall ſinnes, and conſequently the keeping of
them not neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <pb n="178" facs="tcp:59214:98"/>and ſhall ſo
teach men, ſhalbe called the leaſt in the kingdome of Heaven.</hi> And
[Pag: 277. N. 61.] you teach, that, God hath <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch an
asſiſtance, as ſhall lead vs, if we be not wanting to it and
our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, into all, not only neceſsary, but very profitable Truth, and
guard vs from all, not only deſtructiue, but alſo hurtfull, errours.</hi>
Which words are directly againſt yourſelf, whom we haue heard ſaying;
That, if controverſyes touching things not neceſſary, or not very
profitable, were continued or increaſed, it were no matter: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as here you
ſay of things any way profitable, that by the loue of God, and loue of Truth,
and obligation of conſcience, and vnder payne of being the leaſt in the
kingdome of Heaven, (that is, of being excluded from the kingdome of Heauen,
according to S. Chryſoſtome, and Theophylact, who interpret minimus, the
leaſt, to ſignify, nullus, none at all) we are bound to be zealous in the
defence of them. A great zeale indeed, to maintayne, that, if deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
concerning them, could not be ended, but continued or increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it were no
matter! Do you not through your whole Booke teach, that all errours againſt
revealed truths, are breaches of Gods command, and are in themſelves
damnable, and will effectually proue ſuch, if ignorance do not excuſe, or a
generall Repentance do not obtaine pardon for them? How then is it no matter,
if they remayne vndecided, or that there be no meanes to decide them? Is it no
matter whether one by breaking one of Gods commandements, be leaſt in the
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven? As for your Parentheſis, that <hi>we pretend, ſome of
the commandements to be concerning veniall, ſins, the keeping wherof is not
neceſſary to ſalvation;</hi> I ſay, it is either vntrue, or
impertinent. For, if you meane, that we pretend ſome errour againſt any
leaſt revealed Truth, ſufficiently propoſed, to be a veniall ſin, it is
very vntrue. You know, that <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> doth teach the contrary through
his whole work, and theron grounds the maine ſcope of his Booke: That, of
two, diſagreeing in Poynts of Faith, or Objects revealed by God, and
ſufficiently propounded, one committs a deadly ſin, and without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
cannot be ſaved. If you meane only in generall, that ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands oblige
only vnder a veniall ſinne, your ſaying is impertinent to a matter, in
which the leaſt ſin committed by disbelieving any Poynt ſufficiently
propoſed as a divine Revelation, is deadly, as I haue declared, and you
often, and purpoſely grant. Yea further; how can it be ſayd, that ſome of
the leaſt commandements of which our Saviour <pb n="179" facs="tcp:59214:98"/>ſpeakes,
are concerning veniall ſins? ſeing our Saviour affirmes, that, whoſoever
ſhall break one of his leaſt commandements, and ſhall ſo teach men,
ſhalbe called the leaſtin the kingdome of Heaven, if thoſe words
ſignify an excluſion from Heaven? Or, if this expoſition pleaſe you
not, but that you will haue them vnderſtood of veniall ſins, then you
muſt explicate, how our Saviour could ſay, he that ſhall break one of his
Commandements obliging only vnder a veniall ſin, ſhalbe leaſt in the
kingdome of Heaven, ſeing all men break ſuch commands, by committing
veniall ſins, and ſo there ſhalbe no compariſon or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction
of leaſt or great, but all muſt be reckoned amongſt the leaſt.
Beſides; you muſt reflect, that our Saviour ſpeakes of him <hi>that
ſhall break one of his leaſt commandements, and ſhall ſo teach
men.</hi> Now, though it be but a veniall ſin to breake a commandement, which
obliges only to abſtaine from a veniall ſin; yet, to teach, that it is
lawfull to breake any commandement, even concerning veniall ſins, is a great
and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin, as being an errour againſt Faith: As for example, to lye
or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly to vtter an vntruth, oſſiciocè, or jocoſe, without
prejudice vnto any, is but a veniall ſin: yet to belieue, and much more to
profess and teach, that it is no ſin to lye, were a grievous deadly ſin of
Hereſy. To what purpoſe then do you tell vs, of our pretending, that ſome
leaſt commandements are only concerning veniall ſins? But the truth is, I
conceyue it will be hard to name any writer who doth ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> caſt
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into labyrinths, and perplexityes, as you doe. In the meane tyme, it
appeares more and more, how neceſſary it is, that there be ſome living
judg for determining Controverſyes of Religion, not only in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
vniverſally, and abſolutely, and in all caſes, neceſſary; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
for other Poynts, which by occaſion of emergent Hereſyes, or for avoyding
contentions, and danger of Schiſmes, or other cauſes, may neceſſarily
require to be determined: And that, things profitable, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as it were in
generall, are neceſſary to be believed in Gods Church, as I haue declared
aboue.</p>
               <p n="75">75. Which truth is yet ſtrongly proved by other words
of yours in the ſame (Pag. 9. N. 7.) where, about holding errours not
neceſſary, or not fundamentall, you ſay; <hi>It imports very much, though
not for the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that you may be ſaved, yet for the probality
that you will be ſo: becauſe the holding of theſe errours, though it did
not merit, might yet occaſion damnation. As the doctrine of Indulgences may
take away the feare of Purgatory, and the doctrine of Purgatory the feare of
Hell, as you well know it does too frequently. <pb n="180" facs="tcp:59214:99"/>So that
though a godly man might be ſaved with theſe errours, yet by meanes of
them, many are made vicious, and ſo damned. By them, I ſay, though not for
them. No godly Layman who is verily perſwaded that there is neither impiety
nor ſuperſtition in the vſe of your Latine ſervice, shall be damned, I
hope, for being preſent at it; yet the want of that devotion which the
frequent hearing the Offices vnderſtood, might happily beget in them, the
want of that inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and edification which is might afford them, may
very probably hinder the ſalvation of many which otherwiſe might haue bene
ſaved. Beſides; though the matter of an Errour may be only ſomething
profitable, not neceſſary, yet the neglect of it may be a damnable ſinne.
As not to regard veniall ſinnes, is in the doctrine of your Schooles,
mortall. Laſtly: as veniall ſinnes, you ſay, diſpoſe men to mortall;
ſo the erring from ſome profitable, though leſser, truth, may diſpoſe
a man to errours in greater matters. As, for example: The belief of the Popes
infallibility is, I hope, not vnpardonably damnable to every one that holds it:
yet if it be a falſhood (as moſt certainly it is) it puts a man into a very
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous diſpoſition to belieue Antichriſt, if he should chance to get
into that See.</hi> Theſe be your words; to which I may add what you haue
(Pag. 388. N. 6.) where you ſay to your adverſary: <hi>Wheras you ſay, it
is directly againſt Charity to our ſelves, to adventure the omitting of any
meanes neceſſary to ſalvation, this is true: but ſo this alſo that it
is directly againſt the ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to adventure the omitting any thing,
that may any way helpe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to my ſalvation, that may make the way to
it more ſecure, or less dangerous. And therfor if the errours of the Roman
Church do but hinder me in this way, or any way endanger it, I am in Charity to
my ſelf bound to forſake them, though they be not deſtructiue of it.</hi>
And, (Pag. 278. N. 61.) you ſay: <hi>If I did not find in my ſelf a loue
and deſire of all profitable truth: If I did not put away idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and
prejudice, and worldly affections, and ſo examine to the bottome all my
opinions of divine matters, being prepared in mynd to follow God, and God only,
which way ſoever he shall lead me; if I did not hope, that I either doe, or
endevour to doe theſe things, certainly I should haue litle hope of obtaining
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> What could haue bene ſayd more effectually, to proue the
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſome infallible Meanes to decide controverſyes eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in
things only ſomthing profitable, (as you ſpeake.) For, out of theſe your
own words it will be demanded, whether it be no matter, that ſuch poynts be
declared, ſince they may import very much, though not for the
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility that men may be ſaved, yet for the probability that it will
be ſo, becauſe the holding of errours in thoſe matters, though it did not
merit, might yet occaſion damnation; and by the meanes of them, 
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59214:99"/>many are made vicious, and ſo damned: and becauſe the
want of that devotion which the truths contrary to thoſe errours, might
happily beget, and the want of that inſtruction and edification which they
might afford, may very probably, hinder the ſalvation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which
otherwiſe might haue bene ſaved; ſince alſo, though the matter of
ſuch errours may be only ſomthing profitable, not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, yet the
neglect of them may be a damnable ſinne. (And I pray you, what greater
neglect then to hold and write as you doe, that if controverſyes concerning
them be continued and increaſed, it is no matter?) ſince alſo erring from
ſome profitable, though leſſer truth (heer is no mention of
neceſſary, or very profitable truth) may diſpoſe a man to errour in
greater matters; ſince finally it is againſt the vertue of charity to
ourſelves, not only to adventure the omitting of any meanes neceſſary to
ſalvation, but alſo the omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing which may any way help or
conduce to our ſalvation, that may make the way to it more ſecure or
leſſe dangerous.</p>
               <p n="76">76. Theſe demands, I ſay, will in all reaſon be
made; and ſince they are but the very ſame doctrine which you deliver in
the ſame words, you muſt grant them all: and then it is eaſy for vs to
infer the neceſſity of a living infallible judg, ſeeing all profitable
poynts cannot, according to Proteſtants, be proved evidently out of
ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; both becauſe their Argument holds not in this caſe; namely,
(That if all things neceſſary were not evidently contayned in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they could not be neceſſary, ſince we ſpeake not of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but
only of profitable, and ſomthing profitable, and leſſer truths, to vſe
your words:) And alſo becauſe experience ſhewes, that Proteſtants do
not agree, nor haue any infallible certaine meanes to bring them to an
agreement, concerning ſuch poynts.</p>
               <p n="77">77. But here is not an end of the advantages you giue vs
againſt your ſelf, adding greater ſtrength to this Argument. For, (Pag:
277. N. 61.) You teach, that <hi>ſuch an aſſiſtance is conditionally
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vs as ſhall lead us, if we be not wanting to it and ourſelues,
into all, not only neceſſary, but very profitable truth, and guard us from
all not only deſtructiue, but alſo hurtfull Errours.</hi> And afterwards
ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a Church which <hi>retaynes fundamentall truth,</hi> but is
regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of others, you ſay; <hi>Though the ſimple defect of ſome
truths profitable only, and not ſimply neceſſary, may conſiſt with
ſalvation; yet who is there that can giue her ſufficient aſſurance,
that the neglect of ſuch truths is not <pb n="182" facs="tcp:59214:100"/>damnable?
Beſides, who is there that can put her in ſufficient caution, that theſe
Errours about profitable matters, may not according to the vſuall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity
of errour, bring forth others of a higher quality, ſuch as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
and peſtilent, and vndermine by ſecret conſequences the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of Religion and piety? Who can ſay, that a Church hath ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcharged her duty to God and man, by avoyding only Fundamentall Hereſyes,
if in the meane tyme ſhe be negligent of others, which, though they do not
plainly deſtroy ſalvation, yet obſcure, and hinder, and only not block vp
the way to it? Which, though of themſelves and immediatly they damne no man,
yet are cauſes and occaſions that many men run the race of Chriſtian
piety more remisſly, then</hi> they ſhould, many <hi>defer their
repentance, many goe on ſecurely in ſinnes, and ſo at length are damned
by meanes and occaſion of their Errours, though not for them.</hi> And [Pag:
218. N. 49.] you ſay, <hi>I would not be ſo miſtaken as if I thought the
er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours even of ſome Proteſtants, vnconſiderable things, and matters of
no moment. For, the truth is I am very fearfull, that ſome of their opinions,
either as they are, or as they are apt to be miſtaken, (though not of
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo damnable, but that good and holy men may be ſaued with
them, yet) are too frequent occaſions of our remiſſnes and ſtackness in
running the race of Chriſtian Profesſion, of our deferring Repentance and
Converſion to God, of our frequent relapſes into ſinne, and not ſeldome
of ſecurity, in ſinning; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, though not certaine cauſes,
yet too frequent occaſions of many mens damnation.</hi> And [Pag: 280 N. 66.]
<hi>Capitall danger may ariſe from errours though not fundamentall.</hi> And
how can an inanimate writing declare, for all variety of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſuch danger is particularly to be feared?</p>
               <p n="78">78. From theſe your ſayings I gather 2. things: the
one, how da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous Errours are, in matters belonging to Faith, though they
concerne only profitable Poynts. The other: That God hath promiſed an
aſſiſtance ſufficient to lead vs into all, not only neceſſary, but
very profitable truth, if we be not wanting to it. From the firſt, I collect,
as before, the neceſſity of ſome ſure Meanes to avoyd Errours againſt
profitable Truth: And that you ſpeake very irreligiouſly in ſaying, That
if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſyes concerning them be continued and increaſed, it is no
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. From the ſecond, I frame this demonſtratiue Argument: If God hath
promiſed an aſſiſtance for attaining the knowledg of profitable Truths,
he hath not fayled to leaue ſome Meanes wherby, we vſing our beſt
endeavours, may certainly attaine that knowledg by thoſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But this
meanes cannot be ſcripture alone, the interpretation wherof remaynes
vncertaine, even though we vſe all the Rules preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed 
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59214:100"/>by Proteſtants, as we haue proved, and they confess.
Therfor ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be that Meanes wherby, we vſing our beſt
endeavours, may attaine the knowledg of profitable truths. Therfor we muſt
have recourſe to an infallible living judg. And now I beſeech the reader to
conſider how vnreaſonable and vnconſcionable a thing it is Firſt, to
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch a very great danger of being damned, vnless one come to the knowledg,
not only of neceſſary, but alſo of profitable poynts; and that, God hath
promiſed ſufficient help and aſſiſtance to attaine ſuch a
knowledge, and yet. Secondly, that it is impoſſible for vs to fynd, or
vſe, any certaine meanes, which God hath left for that end of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things
not only neceſſary, but alſo profitable. This contradiction, or
inconvenience, cannot be avoyded, except (as I ſayd) by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, and
ſubmitting to a living judg.</p>
               <p n="79">79. Before I leaue this poynt, I muſt not omitt to
touch ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent ſayings of yours, and then goe forward. You
confess (Pag: 277. N. 61.) that, <hi>Dr. Potter</hi> affirmes, that, <hi>God
hath promiſed abſolutely, that there ſhalbe preſerved to the worlds
end, ſuch a company of Chriſtians who hold all things preciſely and
indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> If this be ſo, why do
you not object againſt the Doctour, as you do againſt vs, and aske him;
whether that company of Chriſtians can reſiſt Gods mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and helps
wherby they are preſerved in the belief of things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary? As alſo, how
do you defend the Doctour, ſince you do not hold it abſolutely certaine,
but only hope that there ſhalbe ſuch a company of Chriſtians to the
worlds end; wheras the Doctour alledges, and relyes on the promiſe of God,
for ſuch a ſtability of his Church, and ſo muſt hold it for a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> article
of Faith, as he profeſſes to doe. Surely this is a poynt of greateſt
importance, and more then only profitable, and ſcriptures ſpeak clearly
enough for the perpetuity of Gods Church, and yet you two do not agree therin;
which ſhewes, how impoſſible it is to decide controverſyes by
ſcripture alone.</p>
               <p n="80">80. Another ſaying of yours will, I belieue, hardly be
defended from a contradiction. For, (Pag: 277. N. 61) having ſpoken of
Errours againſt profitable truths, and declared how extremely dangerous they
are, you ſay (P. 278.) <hi>Thoſe of the Roman Church are worſe, even in
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves damnable, and by accident only pardonable,</hi> Now an errour to
be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in it ſelf, muſt conſiſt in this, that it oppoſes ſome
truth revealed by God, which is <hi>intrinſecè matum,</hi>
eſſentially evill, a deadly ſin, againſt the will and Command of God,
and therfor damnable in it ſelf and by accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t only excuſed by ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
or pardonable by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance. How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:59214:101"/>can you ſay,
that, errours againſt profitable points, are not damnable in themſelves,
and yet that the errours of the Roman Church are ſuch? But why do I diſpute
againſt you by Argument? Heare, I pray you, your owne words, [Pag: 290. N.
88.] where you ſay: <hi>Fundamentall errours may ſignify, either ſuch as
are repugnant to Gods command, and ſo in their owne nature damnable, though
to thoſe which out of invincible ignorance practiſe them, not vnpardonable;
or ſuch as are not only merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, but remedileſſely pernicious
and deſtructiue of ſalvation, &amp;c:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the reaſon for which,
errours are <hi>in their nature damnable!</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>becauſe they are
repugnant to Gods command;</hi> which certainly is common to all errours
againſt Divine Revelation, ſufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whether the matter be
in it ſelf, great, or ſmall. Beſides, it is manifeſt, that ſcarcely
in any matter of moment, Proteſtants do ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animouſly diſagree from
vs, as that divers of them do not hold with vs againſt their pretended
Brethren: and therfor if our errours, as you call them, (which are indeed
Catholique verities) be damnable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, theirs alſo muſt be
ſuch, if they be conſidered in themſelves; which yourſelfe do not deny
[Pag: 306. N. 106.] ſaying; <hi>For our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in their Communion</hi>
(you ſpeake of Proteſtants erring in ſome Poynt of Faith)
<hi>notwithſtanding their errours, the juſtification hereof, is not ſo
much, that their errours are not damnable: as that they require not the belief
and profesſion of theſe errours, among the conditions of their
Communion.</hi> Wherfor I muſt returne to conclude, that, in affirming our
errours to be damnable in themſelves, and ſo, worſe than thoſe of
Proteſtants, you manifeſtly contradict yourſelf, and truth, even though
we ſhould falſely ſuppoſe our Church to be ſtayned with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. And
heer I aske, how you can ſay, [Pag: 278. N. 61.] without impiety and
contrariety to yourſelfe, that, Hereſyes not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall do of
themſelves, and immediately, damne no man, ſeing you very often profess,
that to oppoſe a thing, revealed by God, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propoſed for
ſuch, is a damnable ſinne?</p>
               <p n="81">81. I will end this Poynt with noting an egregious
falſification of yours about a paſſage of <hi>Ch: Mayntayned,</hi> in
theſe your words: [Pag: 306. N. 106.] directed to <hi>Ch: Ma: A ſift
falſhood is, that we daily doe this favour for Proteſtants, you muſt
meane (if you ſpeake conſequently) to judg they haue no errours, becauſe
we judg they haue none damnable. Which the world knowes to be moſt
vntrue.</hi> Thus you. But <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> never <hi>ſayd, nor dreamed,</hi>
that Proteſtants did judg, that their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <pb n="185" facs="tcp:59214:101"/>had no
errours, becauſe they had none damnahle; but his words are theſe (Part: 1.
Chap. 5. N. 41. Pag: 206.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">If you grant your conſcience to be
erroneous, in judging that you connot be ſaved in the Roman Church, by
reaſon of her errours, there is no other remedy but that you muſt rectify
your erring conſcience, by your other judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that her errours are not
fundamentall, nor damnable. And this is no more charity, then you daily afford
to ſuch other Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants as you terme Brethren, whom you cannot deny to
be in ſome errours (vnless you will hold, that, of contradictory
propoſitions both may be true) and yet you do not judg it damnable to liue in
their communion, becauſe you hold their errours not to be fundamentall.</q>
Thus <hi>Ch. Ma:</hi> And now doth he not expreſſly ſuppoſe, affirme,
and ſpeak oferring Proteſtants? With what modeſty then, can you ſay,
that <hi>Char. Ma.</hi> would haue them judged to haue no errours, and not to
ſeparate from their pretended Brethren for ſuch errours as are ſuppoſed
not to be fundamentall? Yea He ſpoke ſo clearly, of ſome Proteſtants
their communicating with other of their Brethren, notwithſtanding their
er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, that you anſwer as aboue I haue cited you, ſaying; <hi>For our
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in their communion notwithſtanding their errours, the
juſtification hereof is not ſo much, that their errours are not damnable,
as that they require not the belief and profesſion of theſe errours, among
the conditions of their communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="82">82. No less inexcuſably do you falſify His words in
the ſame (Pag. 306. N. 105.) While you alledg as His, theſe words; <hi>If
you erred in thinking that our Church holds errours, this errour or erroneous
conſcience might be rectifyed and depoſed by judginge thoſe errours not
damnable.</hi> Which indeed if he had ſpoken, were non-ſenſe: but his
words are thoſe which I haue cited. <hi>If you grant your conſcience to be
erroneous, in judging that you cannot be ſaved in the Roman Church, by
reaſon of her errours, there it no remedy but that you muſt rectify your
erring conſcience, by your other judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that her errours are not
fundamentall, nor damnable.</hi> Is this to ſay, that Proteſtants muſt
judg that our Church hath no errours, becauſe the errours are not
fundamentall? Or is it not directly contrary, that though they did ſuppoſe
her to haue errours, yet, even that ſuppoſition ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they might
judg that they might be ſaved in her communion, becauſe her errours are
ſuppoſed not to be damnable.</p>
               <p n="83">83. In the meane tyme, it is no ſmall comfort to
Catholiques, that Proteſtants confess they belieue errours damnable in
themſelves; wheras we Catholikes are infallibly certaine, that our Church is
not <pb n="186" facs="tcp:59214:102"/>ſubject to any errour in matter of Faith: and
though ſhe were, yet even by their confeſſion, we may be ſaved, by the
ſame meanes by which they can hope for ſalvation, that is, Repentance, or
Ignorance, as you every where confess. And in particular, of our learned men,
who, one would think, could not pretend to be excuſed by ignorance, you
expreſſly ſay heer [Pag: 305. N. 105.] <hi>To think that all the learned
men of your ſide are actually convinced of errours in your Church, and will
not forſake the profesſion of them; this is ſo great an vncharitableness,
that I verily belieue Dr. Potter abhors it.</hi> If our learned men may be
excuſed, much more vnlearned perſons are very ſafe, and ſure to be
excuſed: and ſo, all ſorts of men in our Church may be ſaved, even by
the Principles and Confeſſion, of our Adverſaryes.</p>
               <p n="84">84. But now, although it ought not to be to my purpoſe,
in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to anſwer at large, the particular Inſtances which you
brought to proue, that our falfly ſuppoſed errours in things profitable,
may be occaſion of danger, and damnation: Yet, leaſt perhaps ſome
vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perſon, may apprehend them to contayne ſome great difficulty, I
will touch them briefly. <hi>The Doctrine of Indulengces,</hi> ſay you, (Pag:
9. N. 7.) <hi>may take away the feare of Purgatory: and the Doctrine of
Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, the feare of Hell.</hi> But, firſt; how can you object to vs as
an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, that the doctrine of Indulgences takes away the feare of
Purgatory, ſince Proteſtants denying Purgatory, do much more take away all
feare of it? 2. What harme is there, in diminiſhing in our ſoule the feare
of Purgatory, by ſolid and true meanes, approved by Gods Church, as
faſting, prayer, pennance, Indulgences &amp;c: Doth not the Apoſtle
admoniſh vs, [2. Pet: 1.10.] 
<q rend="margQuotes">to labour the more that by good works
you may make ſure your vocation?</q> And what is this, but to diminiſh in
vs even the feare of Hell, and increaſe our hope of Heaven? For, the greater
confidence we haue to be ſaved, the less feare we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue of being damned.
Doth not S. John ſay (Ep: 1. Cap: 4. V. 18.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Charity caſteth out feare?</q> 3.
Againe, it is to be wondered, that any Proteſtant can object to vs the
Doctrine of Indulgences as overlarge, and taking away the feare of Purgatory,
and ſo at an eaſy rate redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the temporall puniſhment, which
remaynes due to our finnes, after the fault or guilt is pardoned, ſince they
deny, that any ſuch payne remaynes after the ſin is forgiven, which in the
opinyon of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them is forgiven by one Act of Faith, firmely believing
that it is forgiven. 4. So many conditions are required for gayning
Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <pb n="187" facs="tcp:59214:102"/>that we cannot be certaine therof, without
particular Revelation: and ſo ſtill we haue juſt cauſe to feare
purgatory, and tremble at the conſideration of Gods ſecret judgments. To
omitt divers other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, neceſſary for gaining indulgences, one is,
that we be in ſtate of Grace; of which none can be ſure in this life, nor,
that he hath ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſorrow, that it is effectuall, and incompatible
with any affection to any leaſt Veniall ſinne: and yet the temporall
puniſhment due to ſin, can never be forgiven till the guilt be perfectly
cancelled. I ſay nothing of the pious and penall works, which are wont to be
appointed for gaining indulgences, as, confeſſing, communicating,
faſting, praying, viſiting Churches, pilgrimages, giving Almes, and other
holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, wherby God is glorifyed, our neighbour edifyed, and our
ſoules improved in vertue.</p>
               <p n="85">85. So that it is not ſo eaſy to obtayne the effect
of indulgences, nor are they ſo cheape, as ſome, out of ignorance, or
malice, are pleaſed to imagine; yea and that the Pope gives pardon for all
ſins, not only paſt but alſo to come; which is a ſhameless vntruth, and
falfly layes on vs that aſperſion, which truly belongs to Proteſtants,
who teach, that, not only ſins paſt, or preſent, but alſo all ſinnes
to come are forgiven by Baptiſme. Kemmit: (In Exam: Concill: Part: 2. Tit: de
Baptiſmo Pag: 80.) ſaith; <hi>Papiſts haue fayned, that the grace of
Baptiſme avayles only for remiſſion of ſinnes paſt, or for
remisſion of thoſe which are found in a man at the tyme of Baptiſme.
Calvin: (Inſtit: L.</hi> 4. <hi>C.</hi> 15. §. 3.) <hi>We muſt in no
wiſe beleue, that Baptiſme is conferd only for tyme paſt, ſo that for
new ſins into which we fall after Baptiſme, there muſt be ſought other
new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyes for pardon by I know not what other Sacraments, as if the force
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (Baptiſme) were worne out. But we are to believe, that whenſoever
we are baptized, we are washt and purged for our whole life. As often therfor
as we ſhall fall into ſin, we muſt renew the memory of Bapiſme, and by
that reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, our ſoule is to be armed, that it be always certaine and
ſecure that our ſins are forgiven.</hi> And §. 4. <hi>As if for
ſooth Baptiſme it ſelf were not a Sacrament of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And ſeing
this (Repentance) is commanded to vs for our whole life, the force alſo of
Baptiſme muſt be extended as farr. Perkins (in Serie Cauſar: Cap:</hi>
33.) <hi>ſayth: In Baptiſme being once adminiſtred, remiſſion is
give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not only of ſins paſt, but alſo preſent, and to be committed
through the whole tyme of our life. Sanchius (in ſua Confeſſione: C.</hi>
15.) <hi>Baptiſme is not given for remiſſion only of Originall ſin, or
ſins paſt, but of all, for our whole life.</hi> Is not this every eaſy
and larg indulgence, and an encouragement to all ſin for 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59214:103"/>which ſo facil a remedy is prepared, even before they
be committed? Doth not this indeed take away the feare, not of Purgatory, but
of Hell? Which feare of Hell, you do very ſtrangely affirme, to be taken away
by the Doctrine of Purgatory, but bring not any reaſon to proue it; and it is
certaine no ſhadow of reaſon can be brought. Purgatory is ordayned to pay
the temporall puniſhment, due after the guilt of ſin is forgiven. In Hell
eternall torments are to be indured for deadly ſin, not repented in this
life. Now what conſequence is this: One feares the bitterness of payne to be
indured in purgatory, though he be ſure of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, if ever he come to
that place: Therfor he feares not Hell, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of deadly ſinnes
which he is guilty to haue committed, and is not certaine whether they be
forgiven, which certainty alone can take away the feare of Hell, neither can
the feare of Purgatory affoard any ſuch certainty. Contrarily one ſhould
rather make a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d approue this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: He that feares the leſſer
puniſhment or evill, is apt much more to feare the greater. Therfor, he who
feares Purgatory, will much more fear Hell; vnless he be ſure to dy in
ſtate of Grace, of which none can be ſure in this life, without ſome
particular Revelation: and the feare of Purgatory and Hell, may well
conſiſt togeather, as their Cauſes or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects haue no repugnance; to
witt, I may be adjudged to Purgatory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I hope to die in ſtate of
Grace: And; I am not ſure but I may be condemned to Hell, becauſe I cannot
know whether I ſhall die free from deadly ſin; both which judgments of our
vnderſtanding, may cauſe proportionably juſt feare in our will, the one
of Purgatory, the other of Hell. If a malefactour be doubtfull, whether be
ſhalbe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death, or onlie to ſome other milder puniſhment, for
example, the Gallyes, or perpetuall impriſonment, or the like, may he not
feare both death and other puniſhments, till his doubt be cleared? Which
cannot be cleared in this life in order to be adjudged to Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or Hell.
Proteſtants are they indeed, who take away all feare of Purgatory, by denying
it; and of Hell, by their pretended certaine Faith, that they are

               <p n="86">86. <hi>The want,</hi> you ſay, <hi>of that devotion
which the frequent hearing of the offices vnderſtood, might happily beget in
them, the want of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and edification which it might afford
them, may very probably hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſalvation of many which otherwiſe might
haue been ſaved.</hi> But by <pb n="189" facs="tcp:59214:103"/>this manner of arguing,
what may not be proved, or diſproved, if firſt one will begg the
queſtion, and ſuppoſe vs to be in errour, and then vpon remote
conſequences, rather fetch't than found, and wilde conjectures and panick
feares, inferr I know not what dangers? In ſuch manner, as if men were to
leade their life accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch a way of direction, they could never be
free, from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable perplexityes, and run hazard of looſing either their
witts, or ſoules. We are in matters concerning our ſoules, to governe our
ſelves by ſuch Rules, as God hath revealed, and not by vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
conditionall, hidden events, and which, if we be left to our owne conjectures,
may be alledged contrary wayes: as for example, you ſay, that the doctrine of
indulgences is dangerous, becauſe it may take away the feare of Purgatory.
And why may not I ſay, that the denying of Indulgences (beſides the
Hereſy which is of it ſelfe damnable) is dangerous for the ſequeles;
becauſe the want of that devotion, and omiſſion of very many works of
many vertues, as repentance, pennance, Charity &amp;c: to which a deſire, and
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to gaine Indulgences, would moue vs, would very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably hinder the
ſalvation of many, which otherwiſe might haue bene ſaved, as you ſay of
hearing the publike Offices, celebrated in a toung not vnderſtood by all.
Concerning which inſtances; I ſay, That if the doctrine of Proteſtants,
in this matter be falſe, (as moſt certainly it is) then not very probably,
(as you threaten vs) but certainly they ſhall be damned, who in this
particular op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their judgment, and Practiſe, againſt the Belief, and
Practiſe of the Catholique Church ſpread over the world, before Luther
appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Nay I ſay morè, that though we did ſuppoſe (which we
can never grant) the Church to erre is this Poynt, yet godly Laymen, (as you
ſpeake) who in ſimplicity of hart, and out of Ignorance, obey the Church,
by this their Obedience oblige, as I may ſay, Allmighty God, never to permit,
that their goodness and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, proue to them an occaſion of perdition.
Rather, according to your manner of arguing, and according to truth, the defect
of Obedience, Religion, and of other vertues, which they exerciſe in hearing
thoſe Offices, would <hi>hinder the ſalvatien of many which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
might haue bene ſaved.</hi> Beſides, if the want of devotion, which <hi>the
frequent hearing the Offices vnderſlood, might happily beget, may very
probably binder the ſalvation of many, which otherwiſe might haue bene
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> 
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:59214:104"/>why ſhall not Proteſtants be obliged
in all their Churches to more frequent Service, daily, and howerly, and be
ſtill receyving their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, leaſt for want of devotion, which that
frequency might happily beget, the ſalvation of many be hindered, which
otherwiſe would haue bene ſaved? In the Vniverſityes, they haue for
moſt dayes in the weeke, their publike Service in Latine, which divers Lay
men, who may be preſent, cannot vnderſtand, and ſo be deprived of that
devotion, the want wherof may hinder the ſalvation of many which otherwiſe
might haue bene ſaved. But ſeing many Catholique Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, haue handled
this Poynt of publike Prayers in Latine, both copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and learnedly, it is
enough for me to haue anſwered, and retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your Objections vpon yourſelf
and your Brethren: and it is a great foolery to depriue men, as you doe, of
their liberty, by imaginary, conditionall effects, which without end may be
turned, on all ſides.</p>
               <p n="87">87. Your laſt Example deſerves no other Anſwer,
than, that it is grounded on a wicked ſuppoſition, that, to belieue the
Vicar of Chriſt to be infallible in his Definitions could be a congruous
diſpoſition to belieue Antichriſt, or that Antichriſt could get into
that See, as you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly ſpeake. There is no malice comparable to the
malice and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Hereſy. But it is tyme for mee to returne from this
neceſſary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and to go forward in confuting the doctrine of
the ſole-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Scripture. And therfor</p>
               <p n="88">88. 15. From Proteſtants themſelves I argue in this
manner. Moſt Proteſtants hold, that we know Scripture to be the word of
God, by the private ſpirit, or ſome quality inherent or internall to
Scripture it ſelf; and think it ſo evident, that, to aske how we can know
Scripture to be the word of God, Calvin (Lib. 1. Inſt. Cap. 7.) ſayth,
<hi>is all one as to aske, whence we may learne how to diſcerne light from
darkness, white from blacke, ſweet from ſoure.</hi> And the Scottiſh
Miniſter Baron (in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixi Tract. 9 Q 4. Pag. 630.) and (Q. 6. Pag: 663 Sect
2.) ſaith <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſufficiently manifeſt its devineness by
its owne internall light, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and efficacy. Ameſius</hi> (de Circulo
Pontificio) ſaith; <hi>We belieue that the Scriptures do ſhine by their
owne light.</hi> Whitaker (De Scriptura Q. 3. Cap: 3. ad 3.) <hi>They who haue
the Holy Ghoſt, can know Gods voyce even as a frend is wont to know, by the
voyce, his friend with whom he hath converſed moſt familiarly a long
tyme.</hi> Potter ſayth (Pag: 141.) <hi>That, Scripture is of divine
authority, the believer ſees by that glorious beame of divine light which
ſhines in Scripture; and by many internall arguments <pb n="191" facs="tcp:59214:104"/>found in the letter it ſelf.</hi> Which words while <hi>Chill:</hi>
interprets to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy only, that men are ſtrengthned in their belief, by
that <hi>beame of light which ſhines in Scripture,</hi> he leaves no meanes
for his client Potter to belieue with certainty the Scripture. For, he ſaith
expreſſly in the ſame place, that the Church only preſents,
diſpoſes, and prepares; which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>there is</hi> (ſaieth
he) <hi>in the Scripture it ſelf light ſufficient,</hi> which <hi>(though
blind and ſenſuall men ſee not, yet) the eye of reaſon cleared by
grace, and asſiſted by the many motives which the church vſeth for
enforcing of her inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one may diſcover to be divine, deſcended
from the Father and fountaine of light.</hi> But how come you <hi>M. Chilling
worth</hi> to know, Scripture to be the word of God? We take it from your owne
words, [Pag: 69. N. 46.] where you ſay to your adverſary; <hi>The
concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your tenth § is, that the divinity of a writing cannot be
knowen from it ſelf alone, but by ſome extrinſecall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: which you
need not prove, for no wiſe man denyes it. But then, this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is that
of vniverſall traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not of your church.</hi> Behold the agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in this maine poynt, on which their whole religion depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds.
Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Potter, Chill: is a blind a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſeſuall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who ſees not
that glorious beame of divine light which ſhines in Scripture.</hi> And
Potter, Calvin, Baron, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d other Proteſtants deny that, which in <hi>Chilling
worths</hi> judgment, no wiſe man denyes. Out of which premiſes of
proteſtants, it is eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That, ſeing ſo many of them
imagine, a cleare light to ſhine in Scripture, which, others affirme no
wiſe man can imagine, (which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true: for if there be ſuch a light
evidently ſhining in Scripture, how is it poſſible, that they can
diſagree about the Canon of Scripture? or how could ſome books haue once
been queſtioned, which now are receyved for canonicall?) We muſt affirme,
that much more a particular text, may to one ſeeme evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to ſignify
that which to an other doth no way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, but perhaps directly the contrary.
And therfor although we haue heard Calvin ſaying, that it is as eaſy to
diſcerne which be true ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, as to diſtinguiſh betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> white a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
blacke; yet it appeares by what he writes (L 4 Inſt. C. 9. N. 13.) that, for
the interpreting of ſcripture, more labour, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d induſtry is required; as is
alſo cleare by the many a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hard rules which proteſtants require for
interpretation therof, as we haue ſeene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue: and therfor it is cleare eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrines of proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that they haue no certaine meanes to judg

to judg evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly of all poynts neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. Nay, ſeing
they haue no evident Ground to know that ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is the word of God, they
cannot be certaine of any one text of ſcripture, though we did ſuppoſe
that the ſenſe therof were very cleare.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:59214:105"/>
               <p n="89">89. 16. It is a maine ground with Heretikes, that a
living judg was neceſſary till the whole canon of ſcripture was perfited:
which being done, they ſay, the ſcripture alone is ſufficient. But even
from this principle of theirs I argue thus: ſeeing they belieue nothing which
cannot be proved out of ſcripture, they are obliged to proue out of
ſcripture this very Ground, that the neceſſity of a living judg did
expire, as ſoone as ſcripture was written. This is impoſſible for them
to do; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no ſuch text is to be found in the whole bible: Therfor
they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold it, even according to their owne principles. See what I haue
ſayd in my nynth reaſon, N. 59 to proue that according to their grounds, on
text will ſerue their turne for our preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t purpoſe, vnless it be the
laſt book or text; becauſe they teach, that ſcripture alone was not
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient till the whole Canon was perfited; and yet who will vndertake
that ſuch a laſt booke, or text hath evidently this Propoſition;
<hi>After the Canon of ſcripture was perfited, the neceſſity of a living
judg did ceaſe?</hi> To ſay nothing that it is not certaine, what part of
Holy ſcripture was written laſt; as alſo that Proteſtants do not agree,
whether ſome of thoſe ſcriptures which were the laſt, or among the
laſt, be Canonical, or no, as I ſayd aboue.</p>
               <p n="90">90. 17. I take an argument from the confeſſion of
Proteſtants themſelves; that, the Ancient Fathers ſtand for vs againſt
them, and that therfor the Fathers erred. Which could never haue happened to
Perſons ſo holy, wiſe, learned, ſincere, laborious,
diſpaſſionate, and whom all Chriſtians acknowledg to haue wrought
miracles on earth, and to be glorious Saints in heauen, if the ſcriptures
were ſo express and evident, as our adverſaryes pretend. Or if they will

premiſes, many of the learned Proteſtants do deale plainly in making
generall diſclaime in the Fathers, as may be ſeene in Brierley, tract: 1.
Subdiv: 14. where, beſide other Proteſtants, he names Whitaker, Iacobus

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus Curio, Sebaſtianus Francus &amp;c: Beſides, it cannot be denyed,
but that learned Proteſtants do taxe the Fathers of divers errours (as is
notorious, and may be particularly ſeene in Brierly ibid:) wherin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they manifeſtly wrong thoſe Holy and Ancient Doctours, yet theſe their

in many points againſt their Proteſtant brethren, as Brierley Tract: 3.
Sect: 7. lit. M. exactly demonſtrates: For example, the Reall preſence of
Chriſts body in the Sacrament; that, Sacraments do not only ſignify, but
alſo conferr grace; that, Chriſt after his corporall death did deſcend in
ſoule into Hell; that, the Church muſt continue viſible; concerning
Evangelicall Councells, Viz. that a man may do more than he is commanded,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vniverſality of Grace, and, that, Chriſt dyed for all; that

Brierley doth punctually demonſtrate, divers Proteſtants to hold with vs
againſt their owne Brethren: which I haue more willingly ſet downe, that
Proteſtants may ſee, how little reaſon they haue to eſteeme the very
name of Papiſts, odious; ſince many of their greateſt Divines are
Papiſts, in ſo very many and chiefeſt Poynts, and (which ought not to
paſſe without reflexion) even in thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Doctrines which to the
vulgar ſort ſeeme moſt Superſtitious, and for which they are brought vp
in contempt and hatred of our Religion, and vs. If our Catholique Religion were
as beggarly, as that of Proteſtants, which is content to call thoſe
Brethren who diſagree from them in innumerable Poynts, we might eaſily
encreaſe our number, with addition of as many Proteſtants as we haue
rehearſed, and of many more than we can eaſily reckon. Certaine it is,
that, Proteſtants will ſcarcely be able to object any Poynts of moment
againſt vs, but that, joyntly they muſt wound their owne Brethren, if
indeed they did vnderſtand what they ſay, and did not think the name of
Papiſts, to be a ſufficient cauſe of hatred, whatſoever that name doth
ſignify, wherof many are very ignorant. But for my purpoſe; I conclude,
that, Scripture alone cannot be cleare, ſeing Proteſtants, in ſo many,
and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant matters (eſpecially in thoſe very particulars wherin
they pretend to differ from vs) are indeed ſo far divided among
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as that they fall to joyne with vs, with whom nothing but meere
neceſſity, and force of evident truth could moue them to agree. And as the
agreeing of ſo many Proteſtants with vs, ſhews that the Scripture is not
cleare (at leaſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of them who are forſaken by their owne
Brethren) ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:59214:107"/>their diſagreeing among themſelves,
doth convince the ſame. For how can men, if with ſinceryty they ſeeke the
truth, be ſo divided, having before their eyes, one and the ſame cleare and
evident Rule, as they pretend ſcripture to be?</p>
               <p n="93">93. If any, for avoyding the premiſes, adventure to
ſay, that, thoſe learned proteſtants who affirme the Ancient Fathers to
ſtand for vs, do not vnderſtand the meaning of their words, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that for
the ſame cauſe, perhaps proteſtants do not agree with vs, nor differ
among themſelves, ſo much as their writings, not well vnderſtood, make
ſhewe: To this anſwer, although I might reply with thoſe words of
Tertullian, (in Apologet:)
<q rend="margQuotes"> Nemo ad ſuum dedecus mentitur
&amp;c: No man will lye to his owne ſhame; but rather to his owne credit:</q>
we ſooner believe the confeſſion of men againſt themſelves, then
their denyall againſt themſelves: as alſo I might ſay, that the
teſtimonies of proteſtants for the ſayd purpoſes, are ſo evident,
ſo many, of ſo different perſons, and delivered not incidently, or by
ſome other occaſion, but of ſett purpoſe, at large, and as I may ſay
in cold bloud, that they cannot with any modeſty be avoyded: yet I will only
ſay (and the Objection deſerves no other anſwer) that if the writings of
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are infinitely beneath the Majeſty and ſublimity of the Style and
miſteryes of holy ſcripture, and proportioned to the weakness of humane
vnderſtanding, be ſo hard and obſcure, we ought, even from this
Objection, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſcripture alone cannot be evident. Thus the
Lutherans do grievouſly complaine againſt the Calviniſts, 
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Gerardus Gieskenius a Lutheran, in his
Book de veritate Corporis Chriſti in Coena contra Pezelium Pag: 93. ſo
charges the Calviniſts.</note> becauſe (ſay they) you alledge Luthers
words againſt his meaning. In like manner, the ſame Lutheran Charges them,
for that they 
<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Vbi ſupra. Pag: 77.</note>
endeavoured to make the Confeſſion of Auguſta (which teacheth the Reall
preſence) to be Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glian, that is, againſt the reall preſence,
exclayming therat; <hi>if this thing had bene done in Arabia, America,
Sardinta, or ſuch like remote Countryes, and of former tymes, this
vſurpation of fraud and hiſtoricall falſhood were more tolerable. But
ſeing the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of ſuch things, as be done in our owne tymes, and
in the ſight of all men, who with a quiet mynd can endure ſuch lyes?</hi>
In like manner Fulk, (<hi>in his Anſwer to a counterfaite Catholique,
Artic:</hi> 17. <hi>Pag.</hi> 61.) is not aſhamed to ſay, that <hi>the
Lutherans and the Zuinglians do both conſent in this, That the Body of
Chriſt is receaved ſpiritually, not corporally, with the hart, not with
mouth;</hi> which all the world knowes to be manifeſtly vntrue. Thus alſo
Dr. Field (of the Church L. 3. C. 42. <pb n="197" facs="tcp:59214:107"/>Pag: 170.) ſayth;
<hi>I dare confidently pronounce, that after due and full exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of each
others meaning, there ſhalbe no difference found touching the matter of the
Sacrament, the Vbiquetary Preſence, or the like, between the Churches
reformed by Luthers miniſtery in Germany, and other places, and thoſe whom
ſome mens malice call Sacramentaryes.</hi> And Dr. Potter [Pag: 90.] is not
afrayd to ſay, that the Lutherans and Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts <hi>differ rather in

in the <hi>maine controverſy between them about Conſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which
after occaſioned that of Vbiquity. The maine truth on both ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des is out of
Controverſy; that Chriſt is really and truly exhibited to each faithfull
communicant, and that in his whole perſon hee is every where. The doubt is
only in the manner, how he is in the ſymboles, and how in Heaven and Earth,
which is no part of Faith, but a curious nicyty.</hi> Is it all one to be
exhibited in figure only, or only by Faith and Apprehenſion, and to be really
and ſubſtantially receaved? was Chriſt as really exhibited to the Jewes
by their figures of him, as after his Incarnation, by his reall exiſtence? No
doubt can be moved concerning the manner of his preſence; vnless firſt he
be ſuppoſed to be really preſent, and not only in figure, or bare Faith,
which muſt preſuppoſe, not make that preſence which it believes; and
ſo the doubt and debate between Lutherans and Sacramentaryes is, whether
Chriſts Body be ſubſtantially preſent, not how he is preſent; of the
ſubſtance, not of the manner only. To ſay, his whole perſon is every
where, makes not to the purpoſe; ſeing the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not of his Divine
Perſon, but concerning his ſacred Humanity. Howſoever, if this Reaſon
be good, it will ſerue for tranſubſtantiation, at leaſt as well as for
Conſubſtantiation, or vbiquity, of which, the Proteſtant Hoſpinian (in
Praefat. de Vbiquitate Lutheranorum Anno 1602.) ſayth <hi>Hoc portentum
&amp;c. This monſter (for it ought not be called a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or aſsertion,
or opinion, or even a ſingle Hereſy) is repugnant to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, contrary
to the Fathers; it overthrowes the whole Creed, it confoundes the natures of
Chriſt with Eutyches, it rayſes from out of Hell almoſt all the old
Hereſyes, and laſtly, which is ſtrange, it deſtroyes the Sacrament for
the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning wherof it was invented.</hi> And yet this poynt is to Potter
only a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nicity. Is it not intollerable partiality, to excuſe
Vbiquity, or Conſubſtantiation, and yet condemne Tranſubſtantiation?
but by theſe examples we ſee, what command Paſſion hath over their
vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and will. And I muſt ſtill conclude, that by theſe
enormous differences amongſt Proteſtants, it appeares, that ſcripture in
matters of great moment is not cleare.</p>

               <p n="94">94. 18, You haue leaſt reaſon of all other, to defend
the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Scripture taken alone, who deliver ſuch Doctrines,
concerning the certainty and infallibility of Scripture it ſelf, that it
could not be a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y Rule at all, although it were ſnppoſed to containe
evidently all neceſſary poynts. Thoſe Doctrines of yours I will only
touch heer, as much as belongs to my preſent purpoſe, intending to ſpeake
of them more at large in the next Chapter. Firſt then; you teach (Pag. 62. N.
32.) that Scripture is <hi>none of the materiall objects of our Faith, or
Divine verities which Chriſt revealed to his Apoſtles, but only the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of conveying them vnto vs.</hi> And, (Pag. 116. N. 159.) having ſpoken of
ſome barbarous Nations, that believed the Doctrine of Chriſt, and yet
believed not Scripture to be the word of God, for they never heard of it, and
Faith comes by hearing, you add theſe words: <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt I but if the
Bookes of Scripture had been propoſed to them by the other parts of the
Church, where they had bene before receyved, and had bene doubted of, or even
rejected by thoſe barbarous Nations, but ſtill by the bare belief and
practiſe of Chriſtianity they might be ſaved, God requiring of vs vnder
payne of damnation, only to belieue the verityes therin contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and not the
divine authority of the Bookes wherin-they are contayned.</hi> This Doctrine of
yours being ſuppoſed, togeather with that other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of
Proteſtants, that, after the Canon of Scripture was perfited, the only
meanes, which Chriſtians haue to know Divine Verityes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by Chriſt,
is the Scripture, (which for that very cauſe they ſay muſt containe
evidently all things neceſſary to ſalvation) it followes, that if
Scripture be not a materiall Object of Faith (that is a thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God,
and which men are obliged to receyue and belieue as ſuch) men are not obliged
to believe that meanes by which alone they can come to the knowledg of Divine
revealed verityes: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d then it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followes, that they cannot be obliged
to that End which they only know by that meanes, to the knowledg of which
meanes you ſay they are not bound. Neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſay, that becauſe we
are obliged to know thoſe revealed Truths which can be knowen only by
Scripture, we are conſequently obliged to know and belieue the Scripture;
becauſe our ſuppoſition is, that we haue no knowledg, ſuſpicion,
imagination, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling of revealed Truths, except by meanes of Scripture
alone. (For if you grant any other meanes, you overthrow your maine ground of
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying vpon ſcripture alone, and admitt Tradition.) And therfor
antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to any poſſible obligation to know immediatly revealed
Truths, <pb n="199" facs="tcp:59214:108"/>we muſt know that meanes which alone propoſes
them to vs, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belieue any neceſſity of knowing revealed truths,
but by believing aforeha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſcriprure; which if we be not preobliged to
belieue we, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obliged to belieue the verityes themſelves, which in
reſpect of vs ſhall remayne as if they had never been revealed, like to
infinite other truths in the abyss of Gods wiſdome, which ſhall never be
notifyed to Men or Angels: This deduction of myne you cannot deny, ſince it
is the ſame with one of your owne, (Pag. 86. N. 93.) where you ſay; <hi>It
was neceſſary that God by his Providence ſhould preſerue the Scripture
from any indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable corruption, in thoſe things which he would haue
knowen: otherwiſe it is apparent, it had not bene his will that theſe
things ſhould be knowen: the only meanes of continuing the knowledg of them
being periſhed.</hi> Now, is it not in effect all one to vs, whether the
ſcripture haue periſhed in it ſelfe, or, as I may ſay, to vs, while we
are not obliged, to belieue that is it the word of God? And the ſame argument
I take from your ſaying (Pag: 116. N. 159.) that we are not bound to belieue,
ſcripture to be a Rule of Faith. For ſince Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts hold it to be the
only Rule of Faith, if I be not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to belieue that it is ſuch a Rule, I
cannot be obliged to any act of Faith: But you ſay we are not obliged to
belieue ſcripture antecedently or for it ſelf; Therfor we are not bound to
belieue any revealed Truths; vnless you gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſome other meanes beſides
ſcripture for comming to the knowledg of them; and conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly although we
ſhould ſuppoſe, ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be evident in all poynts, yet it alone
cannot be ſufficient for men who are not bound to take notice of it, as of
the word of God, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the contens therof, as divine revealed truths.
In a word. Either God hath revealed this truth (ſcriprure is the word of God)
or he hath not revealed it. If he haue reuealed it, then it is one of the
things which we are to belieue, and is a materiall Object of Faith, againſt
your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Tenet. If God hath not revealed it, then we haue no obligation
to belieue it with certainty, as a divine truth, nor conſequently the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it, nor can it alone be ſufficient to deliver all things
neceſſary to ſalvation; againſt the doctrine of all Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And
who can belieue ſcripture to be a perfect Rule, if he do not belieue it to be
any Rule of Faith? Surely, if he belieue it to be a perfect Rule he believes it
to be a Rule.</p>
               <p n="95">95. Beſides this, you deliver another doctrine, which
overthrowes the ſufficiency of ſcripture taken alone. Thus you write (p.
144. N. 31.) <hi>The Apoſtles doctrine was confirmed by Miracles, therfor it
was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="200" facs="tcp:59214:109"/>true, and in no part either falſe or
vncertaine: I ſay in no part of that which they delivered conſtantly, as a
certaine divine truth, and which had the atteſtation of divine Miracles.</hi>
The falſhood and danger of this doctrine, I will purpoſely confute
herafter. For the preſent, I ſay; that it makes Scripture wholly
vncertaine, and vnfit to be a ſufficient, yea or any Rule of Faith, although
it were never ſo cleare and evident in all neceſſary points. For if once
we yield, that the Apoſtles could err in poynts belonging to Religion, we
cannot belieue them with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty at any other tyme, or in any other article,
as I demonſtrate in the next Chapter: and the thing is manifeſt of it
ſelf. All Divines, and all men by the light of Reaſon, require an
vniverſall Infallibility in that Authority for which they muſt belieue with
divine Faith; and if it could erre at one tyme, it might erre at another, for
ought we could know: or if it ſay one thing to day, and the contrary to
morrow, what certainty can we haue, to belieue rather the one than the other?
And indeed we can belieue neither of them with certainty. Beſides, you
ſeeme to require, that every part of Chriſtian doctrine be confirmed by
miracles, beforwe can be certaine of the truth therof; which blaſtes the
credit of all ſcripture. For how do you know, that the Apoſtles wrought
miracles to proue immediatly and in particular, that, ſcripture is the word
of God; Or how can you belieue, that, miracles were wrought ſeverally in
confirmation of every rext of ſcripture? And yet we belieue every ſuch Text
with an aſſent of divine Faith. Nay wheras proteſtants alledg ſome
texts to proue, that ſcripture contaynes evidently all neceſſary points,
you muſt ſhewe, that thoſe very texts were confirmed by miracles, if you
will belieue them with certainty as entirely true; which I ſuppoſe you will
judg to be a Chimericall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour: and therfor we muſt inferr, that by no
text of ſcripture, you can proue it to contayne all neceſſary poynts of
Faith. Divers other errours you maintayne againſt holy ſcripture, which as
in the next chapter I will demonſtrate, make it vncapable of being any Rule
at all for Chriſtian Faith; and therfor you muſt either retract thoſe
errours, or renounce the common principle of proteſtants, that ſcripture
alone contaynes evidently all points neceſſarily do to believed.</p>
               <p n="96">96. 19. And laſtly. I overthrow theit ſufficiency of
ſcripture alone, by not only anſwering, but alſo confuting, the
arguments, by which they endeavour to eſtabliſh it. For, ſeeing it lye
vpon them poſitively to prove their Aſſertion; if it be demonſtrated,
that the arguments <pb n="201" facs="tcp:59214:109"/>which they bring, are either
impertinent, or inſufficient, it wil remayne effectually proved, that they
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not avouch Scripture alone to contayne all things neceſſary to
ſalvation. I muſt therfor of neceſſity be large in anſwering their
Objections; in performing wherof, I both Anſwer and Impugne; Defend the
truth, and Confute my Adverſary in one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall poynt, which alone implyes,

affirming that the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles were wont to preach ſome things only to

which is true, though they were writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, obſcurely, as many things are
contained in ſcripture in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and yet obſcurely: and much less
doth he ſay, that they are evident without the declaration of the Church, and
helpe of tradition, (which only were for your purpoſe) yea that his words can
haue no ſuch meaning, but the direct and express contrary, Bellarm: himſelf
will beſt declare, in that very Chapter from which your objection is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and almoſt immediatly after the words by you cited. 
<q rend="margQuotes">Thus he ſpeaks § ſed

inſtructed out of the ſcriptures, if we vnderſtand them aright: but that

Wherfor Theodoret (L. 1. C. 8.) relates, that ſcriptures were alledged on
both ſides (both by Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques and Arians) and when the Arians could not be

therfore it alone is not ſufficient; which are his express words: and then
gives divers examples of ſome chief points, even belonging to the nature of
God, which all good Chriſtians beleeue as matters of Faith, and yet cannot be

that, that Queſtion

the ſcripture. For, ſcriptures being explicated by the Councell, do firmely

in my judgment it ought to be with them that belieue him, no manner of

Luke in the Introduction to his Goſpell. For aſmuch as many haue taken in
hand to ſet forth a declaration of thoſe things, which are moſt ſurely

               <p n="100">100. Anſwer. Firſt, you falſify S. Luke in
ſaying, that he plainly profeſſeth, that his intent was to write all
things neceſſary. For, where do you find thoſe words, all things
neceſſary? And much less can you find, that he plainly profeſſeth to
deliver all things neceſſary; and leaſt of all, that he plainly
profeſſeth to deliver all neceſſary things plainly, or, evidently. The
Queſtion is not between vs, whether all neceſſary things be contayned in

to Gods Church, for divers particulars; but whether all neceſſary Points be
contayned in ſcripture, expreſſly, in particular, evidently, without
reference to the Tradition, Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or Declaration of the Church: and
it is evident, that S. Luke hath no evident words to proue all that I haue
ſayd you muſt proue, if you ſpeake to the matter. Which alſo appeares
by conſidering that not only Catholiques, amongſt whom you will not deny
but there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned, pious, and deſirous to ſaue their ſoules,
but Proteſtants <pb n="204" facs="tcp:59214:111"/>alſo ſee no ſuch evidence, for
proving the ſufficiency of S. Lukes Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, or any other Goſpell, or
particular Booke of Scripture, taken alone; ſeing their doctrine is, that,
ſcripture contaynes all things neceſſary, only after the Canon was
finiſhed; and yet S. Lukes Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was written forty yeares before the
whole ſcripture was written. For this cauſe, Proteſtants interpret 
<q rend="margQuotes">Omnis ſcriptura vtilis eſt (2. Tim.

commonly alledge theſe Texts of S. Luke, for the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of

that they would haue omitted ſo pregnant a proofe; if they were of your mynd
concerning the evidence therof? Remember here, what you ſay [Pag. 61. N. 24.]

For, if all things neceſſary to be believed, are not particularly written,
in the bible, then more is neceſſary to be believed than is neceſſary
to by written, and conſequently, though S. Luke had ſet downe all that is
neceſſary to be written, yet this would not proue that his Goſpell
contaynes all things neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Secondly, your ſelfe
cannot allow of this ſenſe without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting yourſelf, who hold,
that every Goſpell containes all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believed, and
therfore S. Luke could not judg it neceſſary that he ſhould write all
ſuch things, which had bene but to repeare, <pb n="206" facs="tcp:59214:112"/>and write
the things, already written more than once. Thirdly: The common doctrine of
Proteſtants is, that the ſole-ſufficiency of ſcripture conſiſts in
the whole Canon, or bible, and therfor S. Luke (according to this
ſuppoſition) could not think himſelf obliged to write every poynt
neceſſary to be believed, ſince he was not ignorant, that before he wrote
his Goſpell, the Goſpels of S. Matthew, and S. Marke, and ſome
Apoſtolicall Epiſtles were written, and in them ſome poynts
neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be believed, which therfor were not neceſſary to be
written by him. Wherfor you cannot maintayne this ſenſe, as being
contradictory both to your ſelf, and the common doctrine of
Proteſtants.</p>
               <p n="104">104. What then remaynes, but that S. Luke vnderſtood
All that was neceſſary to be written by himſelf, without omiſſion of
any ſuch point, according to the particular purpoſe and End which he had in
writing his Goſpell, by the particular motion, aſſiſtance, and
direction of the holy Ghoſt, as we ſee every one of the foure
Evangeliſts, and other Canonicall writers do not deliver all, the ſame
things, for matter, or manner, as the holy Ghoſt, for ends knowen to his
Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, did moue and direct them. This ſenſe is true, and
contaynes both a full Anſwer, and a cleare Confutation, and, as I may ſay,
a totall Deſtruction of your Objection, for any force it can haue againſt
vs. For, now you are obliged to proue, out of ſome other evident text of
ſcripture, that the Holy Ghoſt intended that S. Luke ſhould write in his
Goſpell, all things neceſſary to be believed, before you can aſſure
vs, that he, by the word All, vnderſtood all ſuch neceſſary points: but
then you change your Medium, or Argument, and paſſe to a new, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
proof; and clearly confess that the Objection which you haue brought, is of no
force, vnless antecedently to this word All, you proue that S. Luke intended to
ſett downe in particular all neceſſary Poynts. Yea, though you could
proue by ſome other Argument inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of the word All, that S. Lukes
purpoſe was to write all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Points of Faith, yet from thence you
could only infer, that if All were taken in that ſenſe, it ſhould
containe a truth, but not that it hath de facto that ſenſe, and not ſome
other meaning: becauſe there is no neceſſity that every part of
ſcripture contayne all truth, though we are infallibly ſure, that it
contaynes nothing but truth. How vaine then is your bragg of the evidence of
this Text of S. Luke for your purpoſe? Even yourſelf ſhew how litle you
can gather from the word (All) when [Pag: 210. N. 40.] you ſay, that every
one of the <pb n="207" facs="tcp:59214:112"/>Evangeliſts, muſt be believed to haue
expreſſed all neceſſary Poynts, becauſe otherwiſe how <hi>haue they
complyed with their owne deſigne, which was, as the Titles of their Bookes
ſhew, to write the Goſpell of Chriſt, and not a part of it?</hi> Thus you
ſay; and then add theſe words: <hi>By the whole Goſpell of Chriſt, I
vnderſtand not the whole Hiſtory of Christ, but All that makes vp the
covenant between God and man.</hi> But by what, or whoſe Commiſſion, do
you vnderſtand the whole Goſpell with that limitation and declaration? is
not all that is contayned in the Goſpell of S. Luke, or of the other
Evangeliſts, part of their Goſpells, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively? And is not this
ſtill to begg the Queſtion, and ſuppoſe, or take as granted, that the
deſigne of the Evangeliſts, was to ſet downe all things neceſſary to
ſalvation, or, all that makes vp the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between God and man? Or do you
not by this your volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſtriction of (All) beare witness, that you haue
no other ground for vnderſtanding All poynts, or the whole Goſpell to be
vnderſtood of all neceſſarie poynts, except your owne voluntary
affirmation, and preconceyved opinion.</p>
               <p n="105">105. Thirdly. Of all men in the world, you haue leaſt
reaſon to vrge this Text of S. Luke, though it were granted the meaning
therof to be that which you prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. My reaſon is grounded in a doctrine
which you deliver (P: 144. N. 32.) in theſe words. <hi>For thoſe things
which the Apoſtles profeſsed to deliver as the Dictates of humane reaſon,
and prudence, and not as divine Revelations, why we ſhould take them as
divine revelations I ſee no reaſon, nor how we can do ſo and not
contradict the Apoſtles, and God himſelf.</hi> Which doctrine, though in it
ſelf very vntrue, yet being by you believed to be true, engages you in a very
hard taske, of proving, that S. Luke in theſe words all, and, of all,
intended to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a divine Revelation, and not only a Narration of his owne.
Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if your doctrine could be true in any caſe, it might with
greateſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be conceyved to be ſuch, in prefaces, and like
occaſions, wherin the writer may ſeeme to declare his owne intention,
endeavour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, rather than matter of doctrine, Manners, or
revelations from God; as we ſee, S. Luke in the preface to his Goſpell,
ſayth; <hi>Viſum eſt mihi aſſecuto omnia; It ſeemed good to
me;</hi> not, Viſum eſt Deo &amp; mihi, It hath ſeemd good to God and me,
or <hi>Viſum eſt Spiritui Sancto &amp; mihi:</hi> It hath ſeemed good to
the Holy Ghoſt and me, as the Apoſtles in the firſt Councell ſayd;
<hi>Viſum eſt Spiritui Sancto &amp; nobis: It hath ſeemed good to the
holy Ghoſt and vs.</hi> Beſide, this manner of expreſſion; <hi>It
ſeemed to me alſo, having had perfect vnderſtanding of things from the
firſt,</hi> (or as <pb n="208" facs="tcp:59214:113"/>the Rhemes teſtament hath out of
the vulgat, and Greeke, having di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligently attained to all things, and as
Cornel: a Lap: interprets aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuto out of the Greek, <hi>aſsectato,
&amp; ſtudioſè inveſtiganti</hi> ideoque aſſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, all which;
may according to your divinity, ſignify an humane en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour and diligence,
rather then divine inſpiration, Revelation, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance
of the Holy Ghoſt. And this argument may be ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vrged, by calling to
mynd, that Calvin (in Antid. Cocil:) ſeekes to proue, that the writer of the
book of the Machabees cannot be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Canonicall, becauſe in his
ſecond booke, ſecond Chapter, he ſayth; <hi>And to our owne ſelves
indeed, which haue taken vpon vs this worke to make an abridgment, we haue
taken in hand no eaſy labour, yea rather a buſiness full of watching and
ſwette. For, Canonicall writters did write not out of their owne witt and
industry, but by the revelation of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Doth not this argument
of Calvin, if it be good, (as it is not, yet as good as
<hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths</hi> Principle, or rather the ſame in effect) proue
alſo againſt S. Lukes both Preface and Goſpell, becauſe he affirmes
that he hath dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently attained to all things, and that he wrote in order
taking them from thoſe who had heard and ſeene them. Which words according
to Calvins diſcourſe, ſignify that S. Luke compoſed the Goſpell after
a humane manner, by inquiry, by diligence, by labour, by following a method,
and order, &amp;c. Wheras Sacred authors wrote not by their owne witt and
labour, but by revelation of the holy Ghoſt. Therfor if once it be granted,
as you both grant, and ſeeke to proue, that the Apoſtles did ſomtyme
deliver not divine Revelations, but the dictates of humane reaſon and
prudence, where can it happen more probably than in this our preſent caſe?
Or what proof can you bring out of ſome evident Text of ſcripture, that in
fact it is not ſo? Thus in ſteed of proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out of S. Lukes Preface to
his Goſpell, that his Goſpell contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes all Points neceſſary to
ſalvation, you plainly deprive both Preface and Goſpell, of all credit due
to them as to the word of God; And therfor you cannot draw Arguments from them
for yourſelf againſt vs.</p>
               <p n="106">106. 4. Since it cannot be denyed, but that the Holy
Ghoſt might haue vſed the pen of S. Luke, to deliver what beſt pleaſed
his Divine wiſdom, and Goodness; neither can we by humane reaſon, or
topicall and ſeeming probable diſcourſes, gather with certainty how far
he decreed from Eternity to vſe the writing of that holy Evangeliſt, dare
any man preſume by the ſtrenthg of witt, or arguments, to force God
himſelf to decree and performe, what he imagines ſhould haue been 
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59214:113"/>donne? yourſelf (Pag. 102. N. 128.) affirme this
<hi>ground to be falſe, that, That courſe of dealing with men ſeemes
always more fit to Divine providence which ſeems moſt fit to humane
reaſon.</hi> And (P. 104. N. 136.) you ſay; <hi>It is our duty to be humbly
thankfull for thoſe ſufficient, nay abundant meanes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which
God hath of his owne Goodness granted vs: and not conclude, he hath done that
which he hath not done, becauſe forſooth in our vaine judgements it ſeems

                     </gap> were convenient for vs to haue one,</hi> (Judg
of controverſyes) <hi>yet it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God (for reaſons beſt known
to himſelf) not to allow vs this convenience.</hi> Theſe paſſages of
yours I relate in this place, as very conſiderable, not only for this
preſent occaſion, but as a generall antidote againſt your poyſonous
manner of proving your opinions, not by authority, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t texts of
ſcripture, but with ſome conceypts, or reaſons of your owne, which you
apprehend as probable. But this humane prudence is but fooliſhness, when it
is applyed to determine, what were the Free Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decrees of God, whoſe
thoughts are rayſed aboue our imaginations, more than Heaven aboue earth. And
to come to our purpoſe; the Holy Ghoſt might haue decreed to teach the
world by S. Luke, either all things neceſſary to every man, or
neceſſary to the perfect conſtitution of the Church, or myſticall Body
of Chriſt; or no things neceſſary, but only profitable; or ſome
neceſſary, and ſome profitable; leaving other points neceſſary, or
profitable, to be learned from the other Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writers, or from the
Church, and Tradition. In all which caſes, the word, All, had bene truly
verifyed, becauſe S. Luke had perfectly written All that the Holy Ghoſt
intended to be written by his meanes, concerning the words, and works of our
Bleſſed Saviour. For, ſeing, as I ſayd aboue, All cannot be taken in
the moſt vniverſall ſenſe, which of it ſelf it might beare, the
particular limitation, or reſtriction therof muſt wholy depend on the
hidden will, and Decree of God, which we cannot know with certainty by any
humane probable diſcourſe, but only by Revelation; and conſequently, no
ſound and certaine limitation or explication of the vniverſall particle All
can be given, except that which I haue declared, that S. Luke hath delivered
All according to the End, preſcribed by the Motion and Inſpiration of the
Holy Ghoſt. Otherwiſe what certaine reaſon can be given, why all the
Evangeliſts do ſomtyme deliver the ſelf ſame Points, and ſomtyme not;
yea ſome one expreſſes ſome particular, which all the reſt haue
omitted? Or why of theſe millions of words, or deèds, which all of
them haue omitted, <pb n="210" facs="tcp:59214:114"/>ſome were not ſett downe as well
as thoſe which now we reade in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And ſo vpon due conſideration, the
expreſſing the word All, cannot he of any advantage to you, becauſe it
muſt haue been vnderſtood though it had not bene expeſſed, and being
expreſſed ſignifyes no more then if it had bene only vnderſtood, and
collected from the nature of Holy Scripture, and Priviledg of Canonicall
Writers, for whom we may and muſt moſt certainly avouch, that they
perfectly ſett downe All things, according to the direction which they
receyved from the Holy Ghoſt. Yourſelf teach, (Pag. 35. N. 7.) that,
<hi>Chriſtians haue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es ſufficient to determine, not all controverſyes, but all
neceſſary to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;</hi> and why ſhould you judg it an
incongruity in vs to ſay, that S. Luke wrote not all the words and works of
our Sauiour, but all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be written by him; whoſe purpoſe, if
it had bene to make a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, or Creed, or a Summe of Chriſtian
Doctrine, would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an other forme and method, different from the
Hiſtoricall way which he and other Evangeliſts hold. And that S. Luke
propoſed to himſelf a farr different End, 
<q rend="margQuotes">appeares by Euſebius (L. 3. C. 24.)
affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that S. Luke wrote for this only reaſon, that he ſaw ſome
others had raſhly preſumed to write things wherof they had not full
know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</q> he intending hereby to withdraw vs from others vncertaine
nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And Cornel. a Lapide vpon S. Luke, obſerves that S. Luke wrote
the Goſpell againſt ſome idle, ignorant, and perhaps falſe
Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, who in Syria or Greece, had written the Goſpell imperfectly,
yea perhaps lyingly, as S. Luke himſelf inſinuates in the beginninge of his
Preface, in ſaying, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that for as much as many had taken in
hand to ſet forth a declaration &amp;c. it ſeemed good to me alſo, having
had perfect vnderſtanding of things from the firſt, to write to thee in
order &amp;c:</q> So Origen, S. Ambroſe, Theophylact here &amp;c. S. Luke
therfor taxeth Apocryphall Goſpells which went about vnder the name of
Matthias, Thomas, and other Apoſtles. Wherby it appeares, that S. Luke never
thought of making a Catechiſme, or giving a Catalogue of all points
neceſſary to be believed, but to ſecure vs from falſhood, errours,
vncertainty, or fables, which indeed might haue made the whole Goſpell of
Chriſt ſuſpected, whether the poynts contayned in ſuch apocryphall
Writers, be ſuppoſed to haue bene many or few, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or only
profitable &amp;c. And therfor we may ſay that as others wrote againſt
falſe Teachers, ſo this Holy Evangeliſts wrote particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly againſt
falſe Writers; with which End he declares himſelf fully to 
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59214:114"/>haue complyed, by that care and diligence, which he
mentions in the Preface to his Goſpell. For, by this neceſſary induſtry
concerning All things, he was enabled and ſecured not to deliver
vncertayntyes, or falſhoods, or fictions in thoſe particular points which
afterward he thought fitt to write, whether they were to be many or few;
neceſſary, or only profitable; or ſome neceſſary, and ſome
profitable. Neither was there any neceſſity, or congruity, that he ſhould
write all that by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry he came to know; as will appeare in my next
Conſideration. Now what a conſequence in this? S. Lukes Intention was, not
to deliver any falſe or vncertaine Narration: Therfor it was neceſſary he
ſhould expreſſly ſet downe all things neceſſary to ſalvation. The
true conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſhould be this, and no more; Therfore to comply with the
ſayd intention, it was neceſſary he ſhould not ſet downe any thing
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, falſe, or fabulous. And then, I hope, yourſelf will not allow
this Conſequence: It was neceſſary he ſhould not ſet downe any thing
falſe or fabulous; therfor it was neceſſary he ſhould ſet downe all
things neceſſary to be believed.</p>
               <p n="107">107. 5. Conſidering with attention this place of S.
Luke, I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to affirme indeed, that he had (aſſecutus omnia)
attayned to the knowledg of all things, but ſaith not vniverſally, that he
had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all things, 
<q rend="margQuotes">but only indefinitely it ſeemed good
vnto me to write to thee, Good Theophilus, that thou mighteſt know the
certainty of thoſe things wherin thow haſt been inſtructed.</q> And who
can doubt but that S. Luke attayned the knowledg of many particulars, which he
vvrote not in his Goſpell? Even in the beginning of the Acts of the
Apoſtles he ſetts downe ſome particulars, which happened before our
Saviours Aſcenſion, and are omitted in his Goſpell: or who dare ſay,
that he knew not one of all thoſe innumerable things, which S. John affirmes
not to be vvitten by any? As alſo vvhen it is ſayd, that S. Luke vvrote,
that Theophilus might knovv the truth of thoſe words wherof he had bene
inſtructed, it cannot be doubted, but that Theophilus was inſtructed in
more Points then he could read in S. Lukes Goſpell aone; ſince, as I
ſayd, S. Luke in the Acts expreſſes ſomthing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt,
vvhich he hath not vvritten in his Goſpell, and Theophilus might haue redd
the Goſpells of S. Matth. and S. Mark, and ſome other Canonicall
ſcripture, written before the Goſpell of S. Luke; and therfor the knovvledg
or Faith of S. Luke, and Theophilus extended it ſelf to more Objects, or
Truths, than are vvritten in his Goſpell; ſo <pb n="212" facs="tcp:59214:115"/>that
ſtill vve ſee, that, All cannot be vnderſtood of all ſimply, but vvith
divers limitations and degrees. One All may ſignify abſolutely all things
that our bleſſed Saviour ſpoke or did: Another All, all things which S.
Luke believed: another, all, that vvherin Theophilus vvas inſtructed:
Another, all that S. Luke intended to write: and amongſt all theſe and
other limitations, you will never be able to proue, that your All, that is, all
things neceſſary to be believed, is the meaning of S. Luke.</p>
               <p n="108">108. In this Reflection, that S. Luke ſayth he had
vnderſtood all, but ſaith not that he wrote all, I was not only confirmed,
but ſetled, when I found it to haue been deliuered, aboue twelue hundred
yeares agoe, by S. Ambroſe in his explanation of this preface of S. Luke, in
theſe words: 
<q rend="margQuotes">viſum eſt mihi aſſecuto omnia a
principio &amp;c. It ſeemed good to me having attained to all things from the
beginning to write to thee in order. He ſayes that he hath attayned not to a
few things, but to all: and having attained to all, it ſeemed good to write,
not all things, but ſome of all things. For he wrote not all, but attayned to
all: for, if all thoſe things which (ſaith S. John) Jeſus did, were
written, I thinke the world it ſelf could not containe them. For, you may
perceiue, that he purpoſely omitted thoſe things alſo, which had bene
written by others, to the end that a different grace might ſhine in the
Goſpell, and every booke might excell as it were with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine particular
miracles of myſteryes and works.</q> To this we may add, that S. Luke in the
entrance to the Hiſtory of the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſaith, that in his
Goſpell he had written of all that Jeſus began both to doe and teach: But
it is certaine, that he wrote not all that our Saviour Jeſus did: Therfor it
is not certaine, that he ſett downe all that he taught.</p>
               <p n="109">109. 6. Let vs ſuppoſe, (not grant) that by All, S.
Luke vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, all neceſſary poynts a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I pray you marke how you
make him ſpeake; <hi>Becauſe may have gone about to compile a Narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
the things (will you haue vs add here</hi> neceſſary, <hi>that haue been
accompliſhed among vs;</hi> it ſeemed good alſo to me, having diligently
attayned to all things neceſſary from the beginning, to write to the in
order, that thou mayſt know the verity of thoſe <hi>neceſsary</hi> words
wherof thou haſt bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And in like manner, his Preface to the
acts, muſt goe thus; the firſt ſpeech I made of all things
<hi>naceſſary</hi> ô Theophilus, which Jeſus began to doe and to
teach. &amp;c: Let, I ſay, S. Luke be falfly ſuppoſed 
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59214:115"/>to ſpeake thus; and then tell me what good ſenſe
will you find in thoſe words, of all things neceſſary, which Jeſus
began to doe? And how dare you limit the contents of S. Lukes Goſpell to
things neceſſary, ſeing it containes many things not neceſſary?
Perhaps you think I do you wrong, in ſaying you limite the word All, to
things neceſſary: and that you ſay only, that (All) muſt at leaſt
imply All things neceſſary. Thus (Pag: 212. N. 43.) your Nynth demand is,
whether in the text (of the Acts) <hi>All things which Ieſus began to doe and
teach, muſt not at leaſt imply all the principall and neceſſary
things?</hi> be it ſo; will you then haue the Text of S. Luke beare this
ſenſe? It ſeemed good vnto me, having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at leaſt to all things
neceſſary, &amp;c. as if the Evangeliſt himſelf were doubtfull of what
kind of truths he had bene informed, or had ſet downe in his Goſpell;
whether neceſſary points only, or both neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and profitable. Do
you not ſee, into what labyrinths, you caſt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by your voluntary
vngrounded limitations, or interpretations of S. Luke? And how many wayes your
Objection is evidently both anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered and confuted? and further, how eaſily
the twelue demands which you make, to proue that S. Lukes Goſpell muſt
containe all neceſſary Points, are anſwered? Which I will now doe, having
firſt told the Reader, that every one of your Demands or Proofes, is but a
begging of the queſtion, and a ſuppoſall of that which is in
Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, as will appeare in every particular Poynt.</p>
               <p n="110">110. Your Demands (Pag. 212. N. 43.) are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether S. Luke <hi>did not vndertake the very ſame
thing which he ſayes many had taken in hand.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="111">111. Anſwer may be given to this Demand, either as the
thing is in it ſelf; or as it relates meerly to our preſent Controverſy,
to wit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. Luke vndertooke, to ſet downe all things neceſſary to
ſalvation. For which laſt conſideration or reſpect, it imports nothing
for you, or againſt vs, though it were granted, that S. Luke did
<hi>vndertake the very ſame thing, which he ſayes, many had taken in
hand;</hi> vnless you could proue, that thoſe many did take in hand, to write
a Goſpell, containing all things neceſſary to ſalvation, which you will
never be able to doe, otherwiſe then by way of imagination, or as in a
dreame: eſpecially if we add, that you muſt doe it out of ſome evident
Text of Scripture, telling vs, that thoſe Perſons (wholy vnknowen to vs)
had ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſigne: which till you can performe, giue me leaue,
to retort againſt you, this Argument. S. Luke (in your ſuppoſition, or
imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59214:116"/>
                  <hi>vndertook the very ſame thing which he
ſayes many had taken in hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but there is no imaginable ground to
affirme, that thoſe many had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand, to deliver evidently all

affirme, that S. Luke had any ſuch deſigne.</p>
               <p n="112">112. But if we anſwer your Demand, according as the
thing is in it ſelf; I ſay, that we muſt in no caſe grant that <hi>S.
Luke vndertooke the very ſame thing, which he ſayes many had taken in
hand,</hi> but rather the direct contrary; his purpoſe having bene, after a
diligent and faithfull ſearch, (wherin thoſe others fayled) to oppoſe
their proceeding, by providing an antidote againſt their careless, or
falſe, or vncertaine, and apocryphall Narrations. Yet if your meaning be only
in a generall way, that as thoſe men purpoſed, or pretended, to write the
Hiſtory of our Saviour Chriſt, ſo S. Luke alſo had the ſame generall
ayme: (although one might deny, or Queſtion this very thing, and without any
great raſhness of judgment conceiue, that they had ſome other ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
End agreeable to the Meanes they vſed, of falſe, or fabulous ſtoryes,
yet) I will not ſtand with you in the denyall of this, as being a thing,
which can neither hurt vs, nor helpe you, but is wholy imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, till
firſt it be proved, that thoſe men intended, to ſet downe all
neceſſary Points of Faith; and then further, that S. Luke agreed with them,
in that particular deſigne of writing all ſuch Points; yea and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you
can proue both theſe things, out of ſome evident Text of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Beſides, although you could performe an impoſſible taske, and proue that
ſome of thoſe many, had that deſigne of ſpecifying all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Points: by what dreame can any man aſſure himſelf, that we muſt ſay
the ſame of all? Rather (if we will diſcourſe according to meere humane
reaſon or conjectures, without certaine authority) they being many, as S.
Luke affirmes, it was leſſe needfull, that every one ſhould ſet downe
all neceſſary Points, it being abundantly ſufficient, that ſome, or
divers, or many of thoſe many, ſhould doe it. At leaſt, it is
impoſſible for you to evince, that of thoſe many, all had ſuch a
purpoſe; as you profess not to be certaine, but only probably perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that every one of the Evangeliſts, who yet were but foure, ſhould write all
things neceſſary; (and I hope, you will not pretend to be ſure, that all
thoſe many intended to doe more then ſome of the few Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts had
done.) Now, if ſome of thoſe many had ſuch an intention of expreſſing
all neceſſary truths, and ſome of them had not, how could 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59214:116"/>
                  <hi>S. Luke vndertake the very ſame thing, which he
ſayes many had taken in hand?</hi> Could he vndertake contradictoryes, to
deliver, and not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all neceſſary Points? But, as I ſayd,
whatſoever you will imagine thoſe men to haue intended in particular, there
is no neceſſity, that S. Luke ſhould be obliged to doe, whatſoever they
propoſed to performe; as we ſee, he hath not ſet downe all the
particulars, which are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the other three Evangeliſts. We haue
heard S. Ambroſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly affirming, that S. Luke wrote non omnia, not
all, and that he purpoſely omitted things written by others; and yet we may
ſay truly, ſpeaking in generall, that all the foure Evangeliſts vndertook
the ſame thing, that is, to write the Hiſtory or Goſpell of our
Bleſſed Saviour: and therfor we might ſay (if there were any need to
ſay ſo) that S. Luke may be ſayd, to <hi>vndertake the very ſame thing,
which he ſayes, many had taken in hand,</hi> though he did not ſet downe
all the particulars, which you may fancy they intended to write. If S.
Ambroſe could ſay (and the thing of itſelf is cleare) that S. Luke, did
not write all that himſelf with diligence had learned, and belived; why will
you oblige him, to write all that thoſe vnknowne people had written, or
deſigned to write? Eſpecially conſidering that indeed he doth not
commend, but rather inſinuates a diſlike or diſallowing of their
purpoſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, as wanting either neceſſary care, or
ſincerity, or both: as hath bene ſhewed aboue out of good Authors. In which
reſpect, I had reaſon to ſay, that we might well deny, that S. Luke
agreed, even in the generall deſigne, with thoſe many whom he affirmes to
haue gone about 
<q rend="margQuotes">to compile a Narration of thoſe
things which haue been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed among vs.</q> I will therfor conclude,
with putting you in mynd, that you begg the Queſtion, in regard your Demand
muſt go vpon a ſuppoſition, that all neceſſary Points are to be
contayned in ſcripture. Otherwiſe vpon what ground can you affirme, that
all they who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to write the Goſpell of Chriſt, were to ſet downe
all particular Points neceſſary to be believed? For, if you would be
pleaſed to belieue (or at leaſt for the preſent to abſtract from both
parts, and not ſuppoſe the contrary) that beſide ſcripture, there are
other Meanes to propoſe Divine Verityes, your Demand looſes all force; it
being no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that when there are divers Meanes to attaine one End,
we muſt either make vſe determinately of one meanes alone, or els not
arriue to that End: and therfor you muſt firſt ſuppoſe, that there is
no meanes but ſcripture, to belieue Divine Revelations, before you can 
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59214:117"/>make good this conſequence; Thoſe many of whom S.
Luke ſpeaks, and S. Luke himſelf, intended to write the Goſpell of
Chriſt; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for they were obliged to write all Poynts neceſſary to
ſalvation. For, you will be inſtantly, and eaſily, taken of, and
anſwered; that beſide ſcripture, there are other meanes for the ſayd
purpoſe; at leaſt, in your Argument you muſt not ſuppoſe the
contrary, without any proof.</p>
               <p n="113">113. 2. You demand; <hi>Whether this were not to ſet

               </p>
               <p n="114">114. Anſwer: to, this I haue ſayd already, that it
is a Chimera, for you to faine what in particular thoſe many purpoſed to
ſett downe: as alſo, why S. Luke ſhould be obliged, to write the ſame
particulars, which you may dreame, thoſe men ſhould haue ſet downe. And
your Demand muſt be anſwerd by yourſelf, in regard you cannot deny, but
that many things were and are, moſt certainly believed among Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
which are not expreſſed in S. Lukes Goſpell: for example; thoſe
particulars concerning our B. Saviour, which S. Luke ſets downe, only in the
Acts of the Apoſtles, about his Aſcenſion, Apparition to S. Stephen, to
S. Paule &amp;c: as alſo thoſe myſteryes, which are omitted by S. Luke,
and written by the other Evangeliſts; and other poynts, once believed by
Chriſtians, and written by none of the Evangeliſts, nor any other
Canonicall Writer, as S. Iohn (Cap. 21.) witneſſeth. You do therfor both
begg the queſtion, in ſuppoſing, that thoſe many, of whom S. Luke
ſpeaks, muſt of neceſſity, haue ſet downe all neceſſary points;
as if all ſuch points muſt be written by every one who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to write

Chriſtians did not moſt ſurely belieue, many more Articles, than are

               <p n="115">115. Your 3. Demand is, <hi>Whether the whole Goſpell

               <p n="116">116. Anſwer: Every Doctrine neceſſary to

that he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to write in order All things neceſſary wherof he had

               <p n="123">123. 7. You demand, <hi>VVhether he does not vndertake

               <p n="124">124. Anſvver: vndoubtedly no; and I muſt ſtill
repeate that you begg the Queſtion by ſuppoſing it, and vtter an vntruth
by affirming it. For, to omitt other poynts, S. Luke himſelf in the very
firſt Chapter of the Acts, inſtructed Theophilus in ſeverall things not
expreſſed in his Goſpell, for example, of ſome circumſtances of our B
Saviours Aſcenſion: his giving the Faithfull at that tyme moſt holy
documents; an Angell declaring to them that he vvas to come in judgment; a

<q rend="margQuotes">He burſt in the middes, and all his

Matthevv, S. Mark, and S. John, and <pb n="218" facs="tcp:59214:118"/>in other Canonicall
writings, not expreſſed by S. Luke in his Goſpell; of all which, we

               <p n="125">125. 8. You demand: <hi>VVhether he had not bene

               </p>
               <p n="126">126. Anſwer: Certainly he was, and in many more
Points, than were neceſſary. But you begg the Queſtion, if you

               <p n="127">127. 9. You demand: <hi>VVhether in the other Text, All
things which Ieſus began to doe and teach, muſt not at leaſt imply all
the principall and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="128">128. Anſwer: This were an excellent way of proving, if
it were as good, as it is eaſy, To proue what you would haue, by the only
asking whether it be ſo, which is indeed nothing but to begg the Queſtion.
Our Queſtion is, whether S. Luke haue ſet downe all neceſſary Poynts;
and you proue it, by only asking whether it be not ſo; You know, we ſay,
that neither the Goſpell of S. Luke, nor the whole ſcripture alone,
containes in particular, all Points neceſſary to ſalvation: and as for
the word All in S. Luke, it cannot ſignify vniverſally and abſolutely all
things; neither ought you to determine the reſtriction without evident
ſcripture, which if you leaue, you can bring vs no certainty. For if you fly
to reaſon alone your Faith muſt floate in vncertaintyes for things aboue
reaſon; and what certaine reaſon can you giue, that S. Luke ſhould
neceſſarily ſet downe all neceſſary points, rather than S. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,
and S. Mark, whom you only probably affirme to haue written all things
neceſſary? Yea ſeing thoſe two Evangeliſts, wrote before S. Luke,
they ſhould rather haue done it; eſpecially S. Matthew, who wrote the
Goſpell before the reſt; and ſo, in reaſon it might ſeeme more
needfull, that he ſhould haue written all neceſſary points, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
your falſe doctrine were true, that all neceſſary things muſt be
written. In the meane tyme, you muſt not confound Principall and
Neceſſary things, as if vniverſally they were all one. Some points may be
in themſelves Principall, and not neceſſary; Others Neceſſary, and
yet in themſelves not principall: Others, both Principall, and
Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. The manner of the exiſtence of God; Identity with his
attributes; Free Decrees; Infallible Prenotion of all things; the proceeding of
one <pb n="219" facs="tcp:59214:118"/>Divine Perſon from another, and the like, are in
themſelves, and as they appeare to Angells and Saints in the Beatificall
viſion, moſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Objects; but for the manner (which is alſo a
moſt principall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) are not vniverſally neceſſary for all, nor
poſſible to be knowne in this mortall life. Contrarily, the Matter and
Forme of Baptiſme, and other Sacraments, and the like, are not principall
Points in themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, or in their naturall perfection and entity; yet they
are Neceſſary to be knowne. The Conception of the Sonne of God in the wombe
of the moſt B. Virgin, by power of the Holy Ghoſt; his Nativity,
Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſitting at the right hand of his Father, are Articles
both Principall, and neceſſary, and yet S. Mark (who alone beginns his
Goſpell with theſe words, 
<q rend="margQuotes">The beginning of the Goſpell of
Jeſus Chriſt,</q> as part of ſcripture) doth not mention them: and if one
ſhould demand concerning S. Mark (as you doe of the Text of S. Luke) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his words, (The Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt) muſt not at leaſt imply 
<q rend="margQuotes">all the principall and neceſſary
things,</q> which Jeſus began to doe and teach, what would you anſwer?
Whatſoever can be anſwered for S. Mark, wil ſerue for anſwer concerning
that Text of S. Luke. Yea, what will you anſwer even for S. Lukes Goſpell,
wherin is omitted the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, which is a very Principall
and Neceſſary Article of Chriſtian Religion? Could he ſay, All,
aſſecuto omnia, that he had attained the knowledg of all, and yet omitt a
Poynt ſo princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and neceſſary? If ſo, then you cannot by the
particle All in the Acts, vnderſtand all things principall and neceſſary.
Neither will it ſerue your turne, to ſay, that S. Luke makes
profeſſion, to deliver all things which Jeſus began to doe and teach,
which the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts do not profess. For the ſigne All in S. Luke,
being not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood vniverſally, as I haue often ſayd, and is
cleare out of S. John, (Cap. 21.) it muſt admitt ſome limitation, and can
ſignify no more, than what all the Evangeliſts did purpoſe and performe,
that is, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver 
<q rend="margQuotes">all things which Jeſus began to doe
and teach,</q> as far as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the End which they intended,
according to the direction and inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, that all men
ſhould be obliged to receiue our Saviour Chriſt as the true Meſſias; or
els for confutation of ſome particular hereſy; or for prevention of falſe
and ſictious narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: in which reſpect, every one of the Evangeliſts,
might haue vſed the ſame word all as in deeds, they did fully comply with
the ſame duty which S. Luke performed. Which I confirme by the Proteſtant 
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59214:119"/>Tranſlation Anno 1622. ſaying in the Preface to S.
Lukes Goſpell; <hi>It ſeemed good to me alſo, having had perfect
vnderſtanding of things from the very firſt. &amp;c.</hi> Where there is
not the word All, and yet you will not deny but that it is to be vnderſtood,
as if it were expreſſed; and accordingly the Proteſtant Tranſlations,
or Editions of the Yeares 1593. 1596. 1602. express that word; <hi>It ſeemed
good alſo to me, as ſoone as I had ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out perfectly all things
from the beginning.</hi> And therfor all the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, as I ſayd, might
haue expreſſed All, and muſt be vnderſtood in reality to write all, no
less then S. Luke who expreſſes ſo much.</p>
               <p n="129">129. But here occurrs a difficulty, which moves mee
alſo, to make this demand: whether All in the preface to S. Lukes Goſpell
<hi>(as ſoone as I had ſearched out all things from the beginning)</hi>
ſignify the ſame thing with, All in his preface or entrance to <hi>the Acts
of the Apoſtles (The former treatiſe haue I made of all that Ieſus began
to doe and teach, vntill the day in which he was taken vp?)</hi> You cannot
ſay, that they ſignify the ſame thing: becauſe it is certaine, that S.
Luke had ſearched out divers things concerning our B. Saviour, which he did
not committ to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; as for example, thoſe particulars, which are written
by the other Evangeliſts, and not by him; as alſo ſome of thoſe things,
which were not written by any. Therfor, the word all in S. Luke muſt haue a
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſignification, when he ſayth, that he had ſearched or had
notice of all, and when he ſayes, that he wrote all: and ſo, by all which
even in theſe two texts, hath a different ſignification, you cannot
poſſibly learne, that S. Luke wrote in his Goſpell, all things
neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe things, which Jeſus began to doe and
teach, but you muſt doe it out of ſome other texts of ſcripture,
declaring that he in the texts of the Acts, by All, vnderſtands all things
neceſſary to ſalvation, though he vnderſtand much more by All in his
Preface before his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, aſſecuto omnia, having vnderſtood all, but
no man in his wits will vndertake any ſuch task. You demand</p>
               <p n="130">130. 10 <hi>VVhether this be not the very interpretat

               <p n="131">131. Anſwer: why make you not a conſcience, to
deceiue, the Reader, by alledging Authours againſt their knowen meaning? But
this ſhewes, as I obſerved aboue, how hard it is to find any Writing ſo
cleare, that either by malice or miſtake, is not obnoxious to be
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderſtood. And Cha: Ma: (whom you egregiouſly wrong in this kind and
particularly in fathering on him, that which through his whole 
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59214:119"/>Booke he diſproves and deteſts, that a formall
Heretique may be ſaved without relinquiſhing his hereſy) may comfort
himſelf with what, that great Dionyſius Corinthius, (as we find in
Euſebius L. 4. C. 12 Hiſt: Eccles:) ſayd: 
<q rend="margQuotes">what wonder is it if they haue
endeavoured to falſify the words of holy ſcripture, who haue corrupted
thoſe meane things which we haue written?</q> you know, that, thoſe moſt
pious, zealous, and learned men, who wrote the Annotations vpon the New
Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, firmely believe, and vpon all occaſions teach, proclaime, and

this very firſt Chap: of the Acts, 14. and 15. verſe, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely avouch,
and proue the ſame? When therfor, they ſay in their ſhort marginall Note
vpon theſe words, all things, (Act: 1.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">not all particularly, but all the
principall and moſt neceſſary things,</q> it is cleare, their meaning is
not, that S. Luke had written all particular poynts, neceſſary to be
believed in Gods Church, but only, that he had ſet downe, what was principall
and moſt neceſſary for the End at which he aymed; that is, to proue our
Saviour to be the meſſias, and to oblige men to belieue ſo much; as
alſo, to preſerue vs from falſe or fayned Narrations. And it is certaine,
S. Luke omitted nothing that was moſt neceſſary for theſe ends. I might
add, that if we examine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly thoſe words, All the, principall and moſt
neceſſary things, they ſignify not, all neceſſary things, but all
moſt neceſſary, which may be very true, though ſome neceſſary
things be ommitted, and left to the other Evangeliſts, and Canonicall
Writers, or to Tradition, and the Declaration of Gods Church: and ſo the
words of thoſe Doctours, do not make good your demand, which concerned
abſolutely all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and neceſſary things.</p>
               <p n="132">132 Neither doth this any way hinder, but that S. Luke
and the Evangeliſts may be moſt truly and properly ſayd to write the
Goſpell and life of Chriſt while he lived on earth, in order to the ends
which I haue declared; as alſo becauſe though they wrote not all, but
ſomthing of all, as S. Ambroſe ſpeakes; and we may ſay, not ſingula
generum but genera ſinguloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; yet every one of them wrote, of our B.
Saviours miracles, of his Doctrine, of his Parables, of his promiſes, of his
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, of his Death &amp;c: but not every particular, that might haue
bene recorded vnder theſe kinds, or generall heads. And this is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59214:120"/>and literall explication, both for the words of S. Luke
which you object, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for what you alledg concerning the other three
Evangeliſts, to proue that every one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt express every
neceſſary point of faith. For if the Evangeliſts may be truly ſayd to
haue written, for example, the Miracles of our Saviour though neither any one,
nor all of them together, haue written the twenty thouſandth part of them, as
we gather out of S. John, much more may every one of them be truly ſayd, to
write the Goſpell, or Hiſtory of Chriſt, though they express not every
particular point or object of Chriſtian Faith, taken in the whole latitude
therof. I hope you will not be objecting againſt the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, how can
they be ſayd to write the Miracles of Chriſt, of they write not the halfe,
nor fourth, nor tenth, no nor the thouſandth part therof; as you are
pleaſed to object againſt vs, and ſay, (Pag: 210. N. 40.) <hi>If every
one of them (Evangeliſts) haue not in them all neceſſary Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, how
haue they complyed with their owne deſigne which was, as the titles of their
Books ſhew; to write the Goſpell of Chriſt, and not, part of it?</hi>
Good Sir. are not the Miracles of our Sauiour, a part of the Goſpell, and is
not your vnderſtanding by the whole Goſpell (as you declare yourſelf in
the ſame place) <hi>not the whole Hiſtory of Chriſt, but all that makes
vp the covenant between God and man,</hi> (which ſignifyes all neceſſary
things) a voluntary vnderſtanding, and a meere begging of the Queſtion? And
by what I haue ſayd in this occaſion, we may gather, that although

               </p>
               <p n="136">136. Anſwer: I ſuppoſe you would make this
Argument: S. Luke hath written many things less principall and leſſe
neceſſary, then thoſe without the belief wherof, no man can be ſaved:
therfor he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, all thoſe things without the belief wherof, no man
can be ſaved. But why do you not ſay? Not only the foure Evangeliſts, but
all, and every one of the Canonicall Writers, haue written many things, which
be less principall, and less neceſſary, then thoſe without the belief
wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, no man can be ſaved: therfore they haue written all ſuch
neceſſary things. You ſhould conſider, that things may be principall
and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, compared to one end, and not principall and neceſſary
in order to another. S. Luke hath not fayld to ſet downe all things
neceſſary, for that end, which by inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt he
propoſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which was, beſide other cauſes, ver: grat:
preventing falſe Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp;c: to proue our Saviour to be the
Meſſias; for attaining of which end, there was no neceſſity, of
expreſſing all other Articles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith: and therfor you cannot
gather, that he hath expreſſed all neceſſary Poynts, becauſe he hath
written many things less neceſſary. For thoſe things less neceſſary
to be believed by all, may yet be more neceſſary, in order to ſome
particular end, which the Canonicall Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may haue preſcribed to
himſelf. And therfor as the Writers of ſcripture, wrote vpon ſeverall
ocaſions, and for different ends, we muſt not determine, what they were
obliged to ſet downe, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things in themſelves, but with
relation to ſuch diverſity of ends: otherwiſe we muſt ſay, that the
Saints Peter, Paul, James, and John muſt of neceſſity haue expreſſed
in their Epiſtles, all Points neceſſary to be believed, becauſe they
delivered ſome things less neceſſary in themſelves, than thoſe which
they wrote. And who can deny, but that the Evangeliſts omitted ſome Poynts,
more principall in themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, then ſome other which they ſet downe?
Therfor we cannot ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peciſely from the quality of the things in
themſelves, the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their being ſet downe in writing.</p>

manifeſt falſhood, or to be wholy impertinent: wherin I haue ſtayed the
longer; becauſe this Argument taken out of S. Luke, is that wheron you moſt
rely; as alſo in regard, that what I haue ſayd here, will ſerue a
fortiori, to anſwer the Reaſons, which you bring to proue, that every one
of the foure Evangeliſts, hath ſet downe all things neceſſary to be
believed, though you thinke it moſt certaine of S. Luke.</p>
               <p n="138">138. This you endeavour to proue (Pag: 210. N.
40.41.42.43.) though (N. 40.) you ſay only, that <hi>of all foure it is very
probable,</hi> but of S. Luke, moſt apparent; and (N. 43 <hi>It is very
probable that every one of the foure Evangeliſts has in his booke the whole
ſubſtance, all the neceſſary parts of the Goſpell of Chriſt. But
for S. Luke in my judgment, it ought to be no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Queſtion.</hi> Now
this doubtfulness being acknowledg by you, and your concluſion pretend to be
no more then probable, your reaſons can be only probable, and ſome topicall

<hi>for ending of civill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſyes, who does not ſee it is
abſolutely neceſſary, that not only judges ſhould be appointed, but
that it ſhould be knowen, and vnqueſtioned who they are? Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if
it were a diſputable thing, who were theſe judges and they had no certaine

Controverſyes then end them?</hi> If this be true; how will you haue vs, in
matters of Eternity, and of infinitely higher concernement than civill
Controverſyes, take for a Rule, or as Proteſtants ſpeake, a judg, every

abſolutely neceſſary, that it ſhould be knowen and vnqueſtioned</hi>
that they are ſuch. Otherwiſe if it be a diſputable thing, whether they

ſome Topicall congruityes,</hi> vvill <hi>not any man ſay, ſuch judges in

them?</hi> Beſides, Chriſtian Faith muſt rely not vpon probable, but on
ſome infallible and vndoubted authority, vvhich that Rule, or judg cannot
pretend, whoſe Authority, they, who are to be tryed by it, and who appeale to
it, directly acknowledg not to be ſuch. Morover, ſeing Proteſtants hold,
that ſcripture is not only the Rule; but the only Rule of Faith, topicall
Arguments or congruityes, which in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might be of ſome waight,
can be of no force with them in this our caſe. And therfor your endeavours

ſome evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t text of ſcripture, to proue this tenet; which ſince you do

it may appeare, how weake your proofes are, I will examine every one in

you do but repeete the ſame, to witt, that no reaſon can be imagined, that
any of the Evangeliſts ſhould omitt any thing neceſſary, and the like
conjectures of your owne.</p>
               <p n="139">139. That this may appeare more clearly, let vs
propoſe three Propoſitions: Firſt, the doctrine of Catholiques, that
ſcripture taken alone, contaynes not particularly and evidently all things
neceſſary to ſalvation: then, that it is doubtfull, whether or no,
ſcripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines all ſuch neceſſary points: thirdly, that all
things neceſſary to ſalvation, are particularly and evidently contained
in ſcripture, as the Proteſtants hold. This being premiſed, I hope to
demonſtrate, that, every one of your arguments muſt either begg the
Queſtion, or at leaſt proue nothing.</p>
               <p n="140">140. Pag: 210. N. 40. you ſay: <hi>VVhat reaſon can
be imagined, that any of them ſhould leaue ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> any thing, which he knew to be neceſſary,
and yet put in many things (as apparently all of them haue done) which they
knew to be only profitable, and not neceſſary? VVhat wiſe and honeſt
man, that were now to write the Goſpell of Chriſt, would do ſo great a
worke of God after ſuch a negligent fashion:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="141">141. Anſwer. Firſt; let vs apply to this your
Objection, the three propoſitions I mentioned. Firſt, then Catholiques
belieue, that all neceſſary Points of Faith, are not expreſſly, and
evidently contayned in ſcripture; therfor no reaſon can be imagined, that
any of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, hath left out any thing, which he knew to be
neceſſary. Your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will not approue of this conſequence; but we
muſt ſay the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: therfor we can haue no reaſon to belieue, that
they were obliged to do ſo, it not being a thing neceſſary to be done by
them, or any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Writer: and, to retort your owne words, what reaſon
can be imagined, to oblige them therto? Therfor vnless you expreſſly
preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our doctrine (all things neceſſary are not evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
contained in ſcrip <pb n="226" facs="tcp:59214:122"/>ture) to be falſe, and your
contrary aſſertion true, your argument hath no force; and what is this, but
ſtill to be begging the queſtion? Do you not know, that according to the
Rules of Logick, the diſputant muſt proue, and that it is ſufficient for
the defendant, to ſtand to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, till you can remoue him from
it, by force of argument? And yet, for the preſent, I need not make vſe of
this Right, but only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from the truth or falſhood, of our moſt
true doctrine in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and therfor; ſecondly, let vs ſuppoſe it
to be doubtfull whether all things neceſſary are contained in the whole
bible. In this caſe it muſt remayne much more doubtfull, (and ſo, not
ſo much as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but only by Imagination) whether every one of the
Evangeliſts hath ſet downe all ſuch things. For, it may be ſuppoſed
not to be done by every one, but by all of them, or by all the Canonicall
Writers, collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuè; as it is the common opinion of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who
therfor, muſt ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e your
Objections, no leſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we Catholiques 3. Although we ſuppoſe your
falſe Doctrine about the ſufficiency of ſcripture alone, to be
poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively true, and notonly doubtfull; yet you can only infer from thence,
that all neceſſary points muſt be contained in the whole bible, as other
Proteſtants teach: but you cannot gather, that they muſt, be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in
all, and much less in every one of the Goſpelss. Contrarily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you
ſuppoſe your owne tenet, that the ſcripture alone containeth all things
neceſſary (that is, vnless you begg the Queſtion) you cannot ſo much as
pretend, that every one of the Goſpells contaynes all ſuch poynts. 4. you
hold it only probable, that every one of the Evangeliſts, hath written all
neceſſary points; therfor you belieue it cum formidine oppoſiti, and
muſt think it not impoſſible, but that ſome good reaſon may be
alledged (and much more, imagined, which is your word) for the contrary.</p>
               <p n="142">142. Secondly. I anſwer: you ought to remember, that
as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and other Canonicall Writers, wrote not their owne humane
ſenſe, but were inſpired and directed by the Holy Ghoſt, (of whom we
muſt ſay, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Quis Conſilarius ejus fuit? (Rom: 11.
V. 34.) Who hath been his Counſeller?</q> So you muſt not expect, that we
rely on your Topicall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gruityes for finding out what in particular<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was fit for them to write: that
is, what was the will of God, that they ſhould write. What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I pray
you, can be given, why that Holy ſpirit, did inſpire foure Evangeliſts to
write; neither more, nor fewer: Why theſe men were choſen, and not others?
Why they wrote no ſooner? and not all at <pb n="227" facs="tcp:59214:122"/>once, but at
very different tymes? Why they omitt millons of things, and write others, and
thoſe very few in compariſon of thoſe which they omitted? and why rather
theſe few in particular which they wrote, than ſome few of thoſe which
they wrote not? Why ſome things are written by all of them, ſome only by
ſome, and ſome by one only? VVhy other Canonicall VVriters, write many
profitable, but not all neceſſary things? and yet they were wiſe and
honeſt men, and wrote not in a negligent faſhion? And particularly, what
reaſon can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined (according to your manner of diſcourſing) why any
of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, or other writers of ſcripture, ſhould leaue out any
thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the whole Church, as forme of Government, Matter a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
forme of Sacraments &amp;c: and <hi>yet put in many things which they knew to
be only profitable, and not neceſſary,</hi> either for the whole Church, or
every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon; or had they great care of what is neceſſary for
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, and regarded not what was neceſſary for the whole Church?
Of this we are very ſure, that they complyed with that end, for which the
Holy Ghoſt moved them to write; and the conjectures of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
men, as you take pleaſure to be ſtyled, cannot be of force with any
religious mynd, except to condemne you of preſumption, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to
the Holy Ghoſt, what he ſhould haue moved the Apoſtles to write vnder
payne of forfeiting the repute of vviſe and honeſt men and of being
cenſured of having <hi>done ſo great a worke of God after ſuch a
negligent faſhion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="143">143. Thirdly: I Anſwer. If you will needs haue
reaſons (though we muſt not rely vpon our owne reaſon in matters of this
nature) jam ſure, betterreaſons may be given, to proue that the
Evangeliſts were not obliged, to write all things neceſſary, then you can
with any leaſt ground, bring them vnder any ſuch burthen.</p>
               <p n="144">144. Firſt: he who, will impoſe an obligation vpon
another, in the firſt place obliges himſelf to a poſitiue proofe of what
he ſayes. For, till that be done, every one, by the law of nature, enjoyeth
the liberty of which he is poſſeſſed: as on the other ſide, he who
denyes an obligation of performing, this, or that, doth ſufficiently acquitt
himſelf, by pleading, that no ſuch obligation can be proved. And this is
not a bare word or voluntary affirmation, as if in that caſe, both contrary
parts had equall reaſons, becauſe neither of them ſeemes to bring any
poſitiue proofe; but ſuch a denyall of an obligation not ſufficiently
proved, is a ſolid and convincing reaſon, grounded vpon 
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59214:123"/>poſitiue Axiom, Melior eſt conditio poſſidentis:
in vaine therfor do you aske, <hi>what reaſon can be imagined, why any of
them ſhould leaue out any thing which he knew to be neceſſary
&amp;c:</hi> it being a moſt ſufficient proofe that they had no ſuch
obligation, becauſe you can bring no poſitiue proofe for the contrary: and
if they were not obliged to do it, how can you accuſe them for <hi>doing ſo
great a work of God after ſuch a negligent faſhion,</hi> meerly becauſe
they do not that, which they had no obligation at all to doe?</p>
               <p n="145">145. A ſecond reaſon may be not only imagined, but
truly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, both from your particular Aſſertion, and from the generall
doctrine of Proteſtants. You teach, that he who wrote the Firſt Goſpell,
(S. Matthew) delivered evidently all things neceſſary; which to the other
Euangeliſts might be a very ſufficient reaſon, to hold themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
free, from obligation, of repeeting thoſe things, which had bene delivered
already with evidence; and, which they did certainly know (if the thing were
true) to haue bene ſo delivered. And this reaſon vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges yet more,
concerning S. Luke, who vvrote his Goſpell after S. Matthevv, and S. Mark had
vvritten theirs, and as I ſayd, did knovv certainly, that they had vvritten
all neceſſary points, if indeed they had done ſo. Laſtly. S. John,
before he wrote his Goſpell, had ſeene the Goſpels of the other three
Evangeliſts, beſide other canonicall ſcriptures, and therfor might with
good reaſon, think himſelf diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged, from doing that which had bene
done by ſo many before him. And that Holy Spirit which directed the firſt
Writer of ſcripture, (S. Matthew) foreſeeing all future Canonicall
writings, in which, many neceſſary points were to be expreſſed, might,
even according to your humane diſcourſe, moue him to omitt ſo me
neceſſary points, which he ſaw would be delivered in other Scripture or
tradition, eſpecially if we reflect that a truth once delivered in
ſcripture, beleeved to be Gods word, is a much as a million of tymes. Now,
from the generall doctrine of Proteſtants, that all neceſſary things are
contained in the vvhole ſcripture collectiuè, not in every part
therof, a cleare reaſon may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to diſoblige the Evangeliſts from
vvriting, that vvhich they vvere ſure, could not but be vvritten in other
parts or bookes of holy ſcripture, becauſe that Doctrine implyes, that the
ſole-ſufficiency of ſcripture, is perfectly aſſerted and maintayned,
if all neceſſary Points be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the whole Bible, though they be
not all ſet downe, in any one Part, or booke therof.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:59214:123"/>
               <p n="146">146. A third reaſon may be taken from the End which
moved the Evangeliſts to write, which, as I haue often ſayd, being not to
make a Cathechiſme, or a Summe of Chriſtian Doctrine; <hi>what reaſon can
be imagined, that any of them,</hi> ſhould think himſelf obliged to ſet
downe in particular all neceſſary points?</p>
               <p n="147">147. Will you haue a Fourth reaſon? Let it be this
(which may alſo ſerue for a wholſome and neceſſary document for you,
and ſuch as you are) we haue good reaſon to belieue, that the Holy Ghoſt
thought not fitt to express either in the Goſpells, or other Parts of
Scriptures all neceſſary things, that we might be put vpon a wholſome and
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py neceſſity of exerciſing humility in our ſelves, and obedience to
Gods Church, and to our Saviour himſelf, who ſayd (Luke 10.16) 
<q rend="margQuotes">He that heares you heares me, and
(Matth. 18.17.) If he heare not the Church, let him be vnto thee as a Heathen,
or Publican;</q> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a dependence of one man vpon another, as it was
ſayd to S. Paul even in that great viſion (Act. 9. V. 7.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Goe into the citty. And it ſhalbe
told thee what thou art to doe; and to him who was cured of the leproſy,
(Matth. 8.4.) Goe, ſhew thy ſelf to the Prieſt: As alſo for procuring
peace and vnity in Religion, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſerved, if all
controverſyes muſt be tryed by ſcripture alone, that being in effect, to
leaue every man to his owne witte, will, and wayes, as we ſee by conſtant
experience, in all thoſe who reject the Authority of a Living Judg.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="148">148. But what you cannot evince by reaſon, you
endeavour to proue by an example, in theſe words. Suppoſe Xaverius had bene
to write the Goſpell of Chriſt for the Indians, think you he would haue
left out any fundamentall Doctrine of it?</p>
               <p n="149">149. Anſwer. Are theſe Arguments taken from evident
Texts of ſcripture, as yours againſt vs ought to be in this poynt, which is
the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foundation of Proteſtantiſme? If you tell vs what you meane in
this particular Objection by the Goſpell of Chriſt, yourſelf may eaſily
anſwer for vs, out of what hath beene ſayd already. We haue heard you
ſaying; <hi>By the Goſpell of Chriſt, I vnderſtand not the whole
Hiſtory of Chriſt, but all that makes vp the covenant between God and
man.</hi> Now then to your example; I Anſwer: that if S. Xaverivs had
intended to write the Goſpell as it ſignifyes the Hiſtory of Chriſt, he
had not bene obliged, to write all neceſſary Points, as neither the
Evangeliſts, who wrote the Goſpell, were obliged to do; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it is
ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, that we denying it <pb n="230" facs="tcp:59214:124"/>of them, you would ſeek
to proue it only by changing the perſon, as if any would attribute more to S.
Xaverius, than to the Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſts. But if S. Xauerius had purpoſed to
write, not the Hiſtory of our B. Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as the Evangeliſts did, but a
Catechiſme, or ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine, or the Goſpell as it
ſignifyes (to vſe your words) all that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes vp the Covenant between God
and man, which the Evangeliſts did not intend, then what you ſay, or
imagine of S. Xaverius, cannot be applyed to the Evangeliſts, ſeeing in
that caſe, their ends in writing, had bene very different. Nevertheless, even
vpon this ſuppoſition, that S. Xaverius had purpoſed to write a
Catechiſme, we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome particular circumſtances, before
we can affirme, that he was obliged to write all neceſſary points of Faith:
for example, if that Saint had bene aſſured, that in his abſence, and for
all future tymes, there would never be wanting Preachers, Teachers, Prelats,
Paſtors, and Apoſtolicall men, to inſtruct Chriſtians, convert
Infidels, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply abundantly by word of mouth, and a perpetuall
Succeſſion, and Tradition, whatſoever was not expreſſed in ſuch a
Catechiſme (as de facto we ſee God in his Goodness hath furniſhed the
Indyes, with ſo many Paſtours, Preachers &amp;c. that no one Catheciſme
is abſolutely neceſſary:) in that caſe, I ſay no man can judge, that
S. Xaverius had bene obliged to leaue in writing, preciſely every
particularneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Point, but only ſuch as, Tyme, Place, Perſons, and
all other particular circumſtances conſidered, ſhould in prudence ſeeme
moſt for the purpoſe: and ſuch a Catechiſme, togeather with thoſe
other helpes, had bene a moſt ſufficient Meanes for that End, which S.

in their harts by the ſpirit of God, without letters, or inke, and
diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keeping ancient Tradition. It is eaſy to receiue the truth from
Gods Church, ſeing the Apoſtles haue moſt fully depoſited in her, as in
a rich ſtorehouſe, all things belonging to truth.</q> It is therfor cleare,
that the Evangeliſts had no obligation to write all neceſſary points in
particular: and ſome may retort your example, thus: the Evangeliſts had no
reaſon to doe ſo; therfor, neither S. Xaverivs in the like caſe and
circumſtances, had been obliged therto; and not argue as you doe; S. Xaverius
ſhould haue bene obliged to do ſo; therfor we muſt ſay the ſame of
the Apoſtles. I will not ſtand heer to ſay, that although S. Xaverius had
bene obliged, to ſet downe all Points neceſſary to be believed, by every
priuate perſon, as ſuch: yet, I hope you would not haue obliged him, to
expreſſe all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the whole Church, as I ſayd in the

               <p n="150">150. But here occurs a difficulty, which will ſhew
your example of S. Xaverius, or of any other, to be not only inſufficient, or
imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but alſo impoſſible and chimericall, and even ridiculous,
(in your grounds:) of which, I believe you did not reflect. You teach, that
there cannot be given a particular Catalogue of fundamentall poynts, but that
men may be ſure not to faile in believing all ſuch Articles, if they
belieue all that is evidently found in ſcripture, which clearly containes all
neceſſary things in particular, and many more. If then S. Xaverius could
not know preciſely, what points in particular be fundamentall, how will you
oblige him, or any other, not to omitt any one ſuch point? Neither I do
vnderſtand how in your principles, any man can ſet downe all neceſſary
points, in ſuch manner as he may be ſure to omitt none, except by referring
them to ſcripture, or procuring that they haue either the whole bible
(according to the common opinion of other Proteſtants) or at leaſt, the
Goſpell of S. Luke, which you hold for certaine that it contaynes all
neceſſary points (for of the other three Evangeliſts you are doubtfull)
which is a ſtrange kind of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Catechiſme; and yet there can be
no other perfect Catechiſme made, either by Catholiques or Proteſtants,

               <p n="152">152. Anſwer. Heer is nothing but begging the

Evangeliſts was to write, 
<q rend="margQuotes">not the whole Hiſtory of Chriſt,

a contradicting your ſelf in ſaying, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that the deſigne of the Evangeliſts

and not a part of it: and yet you ſay expreſſly, that you vnderſtand
not the whole Hiſtory of Chriſt, but all that which makes vp the covenant
between God and man;</q> which is but a part of the Goſpell, which containes
many Hiſtoryes and truths not neceſſary to ſalvation. Yea we ſee,
that S. Matthew begins his Goſpell in an Hiſtoricall, not a dogmaticall
way, ſaying; 
<q rend="margQuotes">The Book of the Generation of Jeſus
Chriſt.</q> S, Mark ſaith: The beginning of the Goſpell of Jeſus

(which Preface is a brief hiſtory or narration) begins his Goſpell with
Hiſtory; 
<q rend="margQuotes">There was in the dayes of Herod the
King of Jewrie a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Prieſt named Zacharie, &amp;c. S. John indeed
begins his Goſpell with a ſublime point of doctrine;</q> In the beginning
was the word, &amp;c. againſt Ebion, one of your progenitours, who denyed
Chriſt to be the Son of God, conſubſtantiall to his Father; and
accordingly ſayes, (Cap: 20.31.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Theſe are written, that you may
belieue, that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſon of God:</q> which ſhewes, that
his purpoſe was, not to make a Catechiſme, or ſet downe all points of

Evangeliſt through divers verſes of the ſame firſt Chapter, relates how
S. John gaue teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Saviour, to ſhew that his purpoſe was to
write the Hiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of Chriſt, as the other three did, and not to make a

               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:59214:125"/>
               <p n="153">153. But then ſay you, <hi>How haue they complyed with
their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, which was, as the titles of their Books ſhew to write
the Goſpell of Chriſt, and not a part of it? Or how haue they not deceyved
vs in giving them ſuch titles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="154">154. Anſwer. I have often told you, that they haue
written the whole Goſpell, and not a part of it, for all that was to be
written, and written by them, in order to that End which by inſtinct of the
Holy Ghoſt, they propoſed to themſelves. Neither do the Titles of their
Books ſignify any thing more: and therfor not the titles deceyue you, but you
deceyue yourſelf, and wrong the Holy Evangeliſts by framing a fictitious
and falſe meaning of true Titles, by your interpreting them to ſignify all
particular Points neceſſary to ſalvation. Thus S. Luke doth fully comply
with the Title, Acta Apoſtolorum, The Acts of the Apoſtles, though he
ſpeak nothing of ſome of the Apoſtles by name, yea litle of any, except
of S. Paule, nor all that might haue been ſaid of him; becauſe he ſets
downe all that he intended to write, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the direction of the Holy
Ghoſt. And S. Chriſoſtome about the ſame Title of The Acts of the
Apoſtles, (Lib. cont. Gentil.) tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that Booke to be ſo called, not
that it contaynes all the Acts, nor of all, but only of one or two, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
even of thoſe, ſuch as were eaſy to be ſet downe. Nay if we ſpeake in
all rigour, the word Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium, which ſignifyes, Good tidings, is verifyed,
though one write not all good tidings and ſo, Evangelium ſecundum Mattheum,
ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyes good tidings delivered by S. Matthew, or the Book of good tidings
written by S. Matthew, which is litterally true, though that Booke containe not
all neceſſary Points. The ſame I ſay of the other Evangeliſts: And
this obſervation doth clearly make voyd all your Arguments.</p>
               <p n="155">155. But in this place alſo, a difficulty offers it
ſelf, which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belieue, you will not anſwer, otherwiſe than by
acknowledging ſome contradiction, and which turnes vpon yourſelf that which
you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vpon vs, as if it did follow from our Doctrine, that the
Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts wrote not the Goſpell, but only a part of it; wheras
yourſelf alone are guilty of ſuch a ſequele, where you ſay; <hi>By the
whole Goſpell, I vnderſtand not the whole hiſtory of Chriſt, but all
that makes vp the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between God and man.</hi> Wheras therfore, the
Goſpell, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your owne Diviſion, may ſignify two things, and
containe two parts, namely, <hi>The whole Hiſtory of Chriſt;</hi> And,
<hi>all that makes <pb n="234" facs="tcp:59214:126"/>vp the Covenant between God and
man,</hi> (that is, all things neceſſary to ſalvation) you reſtraine
the Goſpell to the ſecond part; and ſo you muſt anſwer your owne
Objection, <hi>How haue they complyed with their onwe deſigne, which was, as
the Titles of their Bookes ſhew, to write the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, and not
a part of it?</hi> You ſay then; they write not the Goſpell, but a part of
it: And yet you alſo ſaie, that their deſigne was to write, the
Goſpell, and not a part of it; which is a plaine contradiction as I toucht
aboue. Againe, you and every one muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the Title, Goſpell
&amp;c. as it ſignifyes the Hiſtory of Chriſt, is not taken vniverſally
for the whole Hiſtory of Chriſt, and then how can you with any ſhew of
probability proue, that the ſame Title, muſt be taken vniverſally, as it
is referred to Points neceſſary to be believed? The titles themſelves
ſay not vniverſally, the whole or all the Goſpell of Chriſt, but
indefinitely, Goſpell of Chriſt; and by what Authority can you draw them
vnto an vniverſall ſignification, and an vniverſall of your owne, to
witt, of all neceſſary Points?</p>
               <p n="156">156. And here, I make the ſame Argument, which I made
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the word all in S. Luke; and aske, whether the Goſpell of Chriſt
ſignify abſolutely all things both neceſſary and profitable; or els
only things neceſſary; or only things profitable; or laſtly, at leaſt
all things neceſſary, as (Pag. 112. N. 43.) You demand <hi>Whether in the
Text</hi> (of the Acts) <hi>All things which Ieſus began to doe and teach
muſt not at leaſt imply all the principall and neceſſary things?</hi>
You cannot ſay without contradicting S. John, that the Goſpell of Chriſt
ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyes abſolutely all things, both neceſſary and profitable; or
only things neceſſary, it being manifeſt, that the Evangeliſts haue
written many things not neceſſary; and you will not ſay, that it
ſignifyes only, things only profitable, which would overthrow your
Aſſertion, that they haue written all things neceſſary: And therfor it
remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, according to your manner of diſcourſing, that it ſignifyes, at
leaſt all things neceſſary, which cannot be ſayd without abſurdity,
as if the Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſts, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d S. Mark in particular, who beginns thus <hi>(The
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt the Son of God,)</hi> as part
of his Goſpell, had bin doubtfull whether they wrote only things
neceſſary, or both neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and profitable; and therfor to be ſure
not to erre did add, at leaſt.</p>
               <p n="157">157. Before I ptoceed, one thing is to be obſerved, to
wit, that it ſeemes you are of Opinion, that the Evangeliſts, themſelves
gaue the titles to their owne Bookes; For you ſay: <hi>if every one of them
haue <pb n="235" facs="tcp:59214:126"/>not in them all neceſſary doctrines, how haue
they complyed with then owne deſigne, which was, as the Titles of their Books
ſhew, to write the Goſpell of Chriſt, and not a part of it? Or how haue
they not deceyved vs, in giving them ſuch Titles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="158">158. But in this you are miſtaken; which beſide
other reaſons, appeares ſufficiently by this; that the inſcription or
Title of all the Goſpells, is the very ſame, only the name of every
patticular Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt being changed; and S. Mark, beſide his particular
manner of beginning his Goſpell, with theſe words, 
<q rend="margQuotes">(The beginning of the Goſpell of
Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of God)</q> hath alſo the ſame common Title,
which is prefixed before the other Goſpells, with difference, only of his
name. And it is not likely S. Mark would haue repeated the ſame words. In
Proteſtant bibles Ann: 1586. 1596. I find this Title; <hi>The holy Goſpell
of Ieſus chriſt according to Mark:</hi> (and the ſame they ſay of the
other Goſpells, reſpectiue) but Ann: 1611. and 1622. they ſay; <hi>The
Goſpell according to S. Mark,</hi> where we ſee different words, and
ſome, ſuch as the Evangeliſts would not haue vſed, calling
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Saints, or terming their owne writing, <hi>The holy Goſpell of
Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Do you think, that S. Paul, for example, for his
Epiſtle to the Romans, gaue this Title, <hi>The Epiſtle of Paul the
Apoſtle to the Romans,</hi> over and aboue that, which he hath in the
beginning of the Epiſtle it ſelf; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Paul the ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt,
to all that are at Rome, the beloved of God called to be Saints. Grace to you:
&amp;c:?</q> Or that he premiſed this Title; <hi>The firſt, or ſecond,
Epiſtle of Paul to the Corinthians,</hi> beſide the particular address
which he makes to them in the beginning of the Epiſtles themſelvest. The
ſame I ſay of his Epiſtles to Timothy, the Corinthians, Theſſalonians
&amp;c: Or do you belieue, that S. John premiſed before his (The ſecond
Epiſtle of John) notwitſtanding that in the Epiſtle it ſelf he ſayth;

<q rend="margQuotes">The Seniour to the lady Elect, and her
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; the like I ſay of the third? Epiſtle vvhich, begins, the Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to Caius the deareſt.</q> If then theſe titles were not given by the
Evangeliſts, they haue not deceyved you in giving ſuch titles, which they
never gaue; nor can it be gathered, as you inferr that they haue not
<hi>complyed with their owne deſigne, which was, as the Titles of their Books
ſhew, to write the Goſpell of Chriſt, and not a part of it;</hi> ſeing,
as I ſayd, thoſe Titles are not theirs. Beſides, if thoſe Titles were
not given by the Evangeliſts, all your Arguments grounded on them, are no
proofes taken out of Holy Scripture, which alone you ought to 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59214:127"/>bring in the Principles of Proteſtants. By the way, I
know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proteſtants reflect, that they haue in their bibles, and
reade publikly, apocryphall Writings, that is, not Divine ſcripture, which
yet commonly moſt of them take to be ſcripture, I meane, the Titles of the
Goſpells, Epiſtles; and I might add, diſtinction of Chapters and Verſes
&amp;c. And even out of the Premiſes, I may conclude; that if the meaning of
the Titles of Canonicall books (and in particular, that which S: Marke hath in
the beginning of his Goſpell, which is a part of Scripture) be not cleare,
who can believe, that the meaning of the ſcripture it ſelf is evident?</p>
               <p n="159">159. You goe forward and ſay: If this (all that makes
vp the Covenant between God and man) <hi>be wholy contained in the Goſpell of
S. Mark, and S. Iohn, every conſidering man will be inclinable to beleeve,
that then without doubt it is contayned in the larger Goſpells of S. Matthew,
and S. Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="160">160. Anſwer. You know we deny your ſuppoſition,
that all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Points are written in the Goſpells of S. Mark and S.
John. And though your ſuppoſition or Antecedent were true, yet your
conſequence or deduction is ſo weake, that without doubt no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
man wilbe inclinable to approue it. For, what a poore conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is this?
The Goſpells of S. Matthew, and S. Luke are lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the Goſpells of S.
Mark, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d S. John; Therfor if theſe containe all neceſſary Points,
thoſe alſo muſt containe them: As if ſome, or many, or all
neceſſary Points might not be ſet downe within a ſmall compass, and
none at all written in a larger Volume. How many large Chapters are there in
ſcripture, which you will acknowledg, not to containe any one neceſſary
Point of Chriſtian belief? And yet the Apoſtles Creed, which Dr. Potter,
and you affirme to containe all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Points of Faith, conſiſts
not of very many words. It is likely, you are of opinyon, that all Points
abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, are very few, and might perhaps be
contained in a few lines or words; in compariſon of which ſmall compass,
one Goſpell may be truly ſayd, to be no larger than another, becauſe
every man will be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to belieue, that three lines may be as well
contained in a book of three Chapters, as in a Volume of a great bulke; as ten
cubits may be eſteemed as larg, as twenty, for the effect of containing a
body of one cubit. In fine, all theſe your topicall toyes, proue nothing,
till firſt you proue poſitively and ſolidly, out of ſcripture, that all
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59214:127"/>neceſſary Points muſt neceſſarily be
expreſſed in ſcripture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that that was particularly
the intent of the Evangeliſts. Let vs ſee what proofes you can bring that
S. Mark and S. John, haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all things neceſſary to be believed.</p>
               <p n="161">161. You ſay (P: 210. N. 40. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d 41) that <hi>S. Marke
wants no neceſſary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of this covenant, I perſume you will not
deny, if you belieue Irenaeus when he ſayes, Matthew to the Hebrewes in their
tongue publiſhed the Scripture of the Goſpell, when Peter and Paul did
preach the Goſpell and founded the Church or a Church at Rome, or of Rome,
and after their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Mark the ſcholler of Peter, delivered to vs in
writing, thoſe things which had been preached by Peter; and Luke, the
follower of Paul, compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a Booke the Goſpell which was preached by him:
and afterward, Iohn reſiding in Aſia, in the Citty of Epheſus, did
himſelf alſo ſet forth a Goſpell.</hi> Having ſet downe theſe words
of S. Irenaeus, you vrge them thus; (Pag: 211. N. 41.) <hi>In which words of
Irenaeus, it is remarkable that they are ſpoken by him againſt ſome
Heretikes, that pretended (as you know, who do now a dayes) that ſome
neceſsary Doctrines of the Goſpell, were vnwritten, and that out of the
Scriptures, truth (he muſt meane, ſufficient truth) cannot be found by
thoſe which know not tradition. Againſt whom to ſay, that part of the
Goſpell which was preached by Peter, was written by S. Mark, and ſome other
neceſſary parts of it omitted, had been to ſpeak impertinently, and
rather to confirme, than confute their errour. It is plaine therfor, that be
muſt meane, as I pretend, that all the neceſſary doctrine of the
Goſpell, which was preached by S. Peter, was written by S. Mark. Now you will
not deny I perſume, that S. Peter preached all, therfor you muſt not deny,
that S. Mark wrote all.</hi> In your Margent you cite S. Irenaeus (Lib. 3. Cap.
2.)</p>
               <p n="162">162. Anſwer: you ſet nor downe the Booke or Chapter
for the firſt place which you cite out of S. Irenaeus: I haue found it, and
find that your ill dealing is ſo very exorbitant, and manifold, that I
ſcarcely know where to beginne the diſcovery, or how to exaggerate
ſufficiently your fraude.</p>
               <p n="163">163 Firſt: In thoſe words which you cite, (they are
Lib. 3. Cap. 1. adverſus Haereſes) it is only ſayd, that the foure
Evangeliſts wrote their ſeverall Goſpells, but it is not ſo much as
inſinuated, that every one, or all of them, wrote all things neceſſary to
ſalvation, nor any leaſt thing that may ſeeme to looke that way, or to be
for your purpoſe in a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y other reſpect, as ſhall appeare anone. But your
miſery is, that ſtill you ſuppoſe that all neceſſary things muſt
be expreſſed in ſcripture, and in vertue <pb n="238" facs="tcp:59214:128"/>of that
begging ſuppoſition, you extend indefinite Propoſitions, as if they were
vniverſall, and yet did ſignify not abſolutely all, as vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalls are
wont to doe, but determinately for your purpoſe all things neceſſary for
ſalvation; wheras S. Irenaeus hath neither the word all, nor the words
neceſſary Articles. Your chief or only care ſhould haue bene, to proue
poſitively a neceſſity, that all things neceſſary ſhould haue bene
written, in every one of the Goſpells, and then you might with ſome more
ſhew of reaſon turne indefinite, into vniverſall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions: but
your negatiue way, or only asking queſtions, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be imagined,
that any of them ſhould leaue out any thing which he knew to be neceſſary
&amp;c: will not ſatisfy. S. Irenaeus teaches, that S. Marke delivered to vs
in writing, 
<q rend="margQuotes">thoſe things which had been preached
by Peter; but doth he ſay, all thoſe things which had bene preached by
Peter?</q> He neither did, nor could ſay ſo, the thing being in it ſelf
manifeſtly vntrue. For, S. Peter delivered many things by word of mouth,
which neither S. Mark, nor any other of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts haue written, as we
may learne from S. John, (Chap. 21.) and S. Mark omitts divers things which the
other Evangeliſts and canonicall Writers haue written, and can you affirme,
that S. Peter delivered none of thoſe points? And in particular, could he be
ſilent of the Incarnation and birth and other Myſteryes of our Saviour
Chriſt, till his baptiſme, which yet S. Mark omitts, as we noted aboue? It
is therfor evident, that S. Irenaeus could not meane, that S. Mark wrote
whatſoever S. Peter delivered, and therfor he wrote only ſome, and not all.
This then muſt be your Argument: S. Peter preached all the neceſſary
doctrine of the Goſpell, and much more; but S. Mark wrote only ſome, and
not all that S. Peter preached, therfor S. Mark wrote all the neceſſary
doctrine of the Goſpell, and more. An Argument like to this: God knowes all
things. <hi>Mr Chillingworth</hi> knowes ſome, but not all things that God
kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes therfor <hi>Mr. Chillingworth</hi> knowes all things. Euſebius (Lib.
5. Hiſt. C. 8.) cites S. Irenaeus thus: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Mark the diſciple and interpreter of
Peter committed to writing, thoſe things which he had receaved from him:</q>
where we ſee no vniverſall, but only an indefinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition Neither
did it make any thing to S. Irenaeus. his purpoſe to treate whether or no,
the Evangeliſts, or other Canonical VVriters, did ſet downe all
neceſſary points. For, he wrote againſt certaine abſurd Heretiques, whe
denyed, that God created Heaven and earth, or breached ſome other ſuch
pernicious fooleryes, <pb n="239" facs="tcp:59214:128"/>which might be confuted out of
ſcripture, though it do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all other neceſſary points of
Faith: And it is too much boldness (another would call it impudency) in you, to
ſay, that in the words of Irenaeus, <hi>it is remarkable, that they are
ſpoken by him againſt ſome Heretiques, that pretended that ſome
neceſſary Doctrines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell were vnwritten, and that out of the
Scriptures, truth (he muſt meane, ſufficient truth) cannot be found by
thoſe which know not tradition;</hi> and for this you cite S. Irenaeus (Lib:
3. Cap: 2.) and (Pag: 346. N. 30) you ſay, Irenaeus had <hi>to do with
Heretiques, who, ſomwhat like thoſe who would be the only Catholiques,
declining a tryall by Scripture, as not contayning the Truth of Chriſt
perfectly, and not fitt to decide Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes without recourſe to
Tradition &amp;c:</hi> But in this, your fraud is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For, thoſe
Heretiks, of whom S. Irenaeus ſpeakes, when Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes did alledge
ſcripture, excepted not againſt it becauſe it did not contayne all
neceſſary truths, or not the truth of Chriſt perfectly, (which exception
could nothing availe them, it being ſufficient for confutation of their
particular hereſy, if the ſcripture did containe as much as was
contradictory to their errours, ſuppoſing they did believe it to be the
word of God) but their exception was, that it was not well written, was
falſe, and not agreeing with it ſelf; as may be ſeene in that very third
Booke and ſecond Chapter, which you alledg againſt vs, in the words which
now I haue cited out of you; and therfor you cannot pretend ignorance for
excuſe of your want of ſincerity. Thus then S. Irenaeus in that (Lib: 3.
Cap. 2.) (the title of which Chapter is; Quod neque ſcripturis, neque
Traditionibus obſequantur haeretici: <hi>That Heretiks obey neither
Scripture, nor Traditions.</hi>) beginns that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with theſe words;
<hi>When they are convinced out of Scripture, they fall vpon accuſing the
Scriptures themſelves, as if they were not right, nor of ſufficient
authority, and that they did varie from themſelves, and that, truth could not
be gathered from them by thoſe who are ignorant of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Theſe
very words yourſelf (Pag: 361. N 40.) alledg out of S. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, and ſay;
The Fathers vrged tradition againſt them, who <hi>when they were confuted out
of Scripture, fell to accuſe Scriptures themſelves as if they were not
right, and came not from good authority, as if they were various one from
another, and as if truth could not be found out of them, by thoſe who know
not Tradition, for that it was not delivered in writing (they did meane</hi>
ſay you, <hi>wholy) but by word of mouth, and that thervpon Paul alſo
ſayd, we ſpeake wiſdome amongſt the perfect.</hi> But the word, wholy,
in your parentheſis is wholy your owne falſe <pb n="240" facs="tcp:59214:129"/>gloſſe, to make thoſe Heretikes ſeeme like to vs Catholiques;
wheras it is plaine, as we haue heard out of your owne confeſſion, that
thoſe Heretiks held ſcripture vnfitt to proue any truth at all, and not
only vnfitt to proue all necſſary truths; becauſe they held it not to be
the infallible word of God, but to contayne falſhoods and contradictions: and
your conſcience cannot but beare witness, that we do not deny the
ſufficiency of ſcripture alone, and neceſſity of tradition, vpon any
ſuch Atheiſtical perſwaſion as that was.</p>
               <p n="164">164. This alſo appeares by S. Irenaeus in the firſt
Chapter of the ſame Book which you cited, where he ſayth againſt thoſe
Heretiks; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Neither is it lawfull to ſay, that
they preached, before they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved perfect knowledge, as ſome preſume
to ſay, boaſting that they are correctours of the Apoſtles.</q> And this
horrible Hereſy he confutes, becauſe the Apoſtles did not preach, till
firſt they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved the Holy Ghoſt. Where I beſeech you, remember
with feare and trembling, your owne doctrine, that the Apoſtles did erre,
about preaching the Goſpell to Gentils; and in ſome things did not deliver
divine truths, but the dictates of humane reaſon, and all this, after they
had receyved the Holy Ghoſt; and then conſider whether you, or wee
diſagree from S. Irenaeus, and detract from the ſufficiency of
ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, if theſe your doctrines were true, would be of no
greater authority than thoſe abſurd Heritiks wickedly affirmed it to be,
with whom therfore you do in this perfectly agree. This alſo appeares by the
words of S. Irenaeus (Lib: 1. Cap: 29) where he ſayth of Marcion the
Heretike; 
<q rend="margQuotes">he perſwaded his diſciples, that
his word was more to be believed, than the Apoſtles who delivered the
Goſpell.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="165">165. You could not alſo but ſpeak againſt your
conſcience, while you liken the Tradition which Catholiks belieue, to thoſe
of the ſayd wicked Heretiques, who indeed agreed with you in the point of
deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Traditions which we defend, as is fully witneſſed by S.
Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in that very Chapter and Book which you alledg, and therfor you. are
inexcuſable in laying to our charge the traditions of thoſe men. For, S.
Irenaeus in the ſame (Lib: 3. Cap: 2.) having ſayd, that when thoſe
Heretiks are preſſed with ſcripture, they fly to tradition, he adds; 
<q rend="margQuotes">But when we provoke them to that
Tradition which comes from the Apoſtles, and which is kept in the Churches by
the Succeſſions of Prieſts; they oppoſe themſelves againſt
Tradition, ſaying, that they themſelves being wiſer not only than
Prieſts, but alſo than the <pb n="241" facs="tcp:59214:129"/>Apoſtles, haue found out
the ſincere truth. And ſo it comes to paſſe, that they aſſent
neither to ſcripture, nor Tradition.</q> Which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Title of
that Chapter; Quod neque ſcripturis &amp;c. as I ſayd aboue. Wherby it
appeares, that they rejected Catholike Traditions derived from the Apoſtles
by ſucceſſion of Paſtours; and therfor when they appeale to Tradition,
it was to certaine ſecret traditions of their owne men; which even yourſelf
(Pag. 344. N. 28.) affirme out of S. Irenaeus, where you ſay, that Catholikes
alledged Tradition <hi>much more credible than that ſecret tradition to which
thoſe heretikes pretended againſt whom he [S. Irenaeus] wrote.</hi> And
(Pag. 345. N. 29.) You ſpeake moſt clearly and effectually to your owne
confutation. For there, you make a paraphraſe of ſome words of S. Irenaeus,
and make him ſpeake in this manner: <hi>You heretiks decline a tryall of your
doctrine by ſcripture, as being corrupted and imperfect, and not fit to
determine Controverſyes with out recourſe to Tradition, and inſteed
thereof, you fly for refuge to a ſecret tradition, which you pretend that you
receaved from your Anteceſſours.</hi> Do not theſe words declare, both
that thoſe heretiks held ſcripture to be corrupted; and that they relyed
vpon certaine hidden and vaine traditions of their owne? As contrarily, it is
evident out of S. Irenaeus, that the Fathers were wont to convince heretiks by
Tradition co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the Apoſtles, 
<q rend="margQuotes">and which is conſerved in the
Churches by ſucceſſion of Prieſts:</q> which demonſtrates, that there
was no neceſſity, that all neceſſary points ſhould be written; and
you wrong S. Irenaeus alledging him to the contrary, wheras it is moſt
certaine, and evident, that this holy Father writes moſt effectually in
favour of Traditions deſcending to vs by a continued ſucceſſion, of
Biſhops and Paſtours, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d particularly of the Biſhops of Rome, whoſe
ſucceſſion and names he ſetteth downe to his tyme, as may be ſeene
(Lib. 3. Chap 3.) and then concludes: 
<q rend="margQuotes">by this order and ſucceſſion that
tradition which is in the Church derived from the Apoſtles, and preaching of
the truth came to vs. And this is a moſt full demonſtration, that it is one
and the ſame life-giving Faith which from the Apoſtles to this tyme hath
bene in the Church conſerved and delivered in truth.</q> I beſeech the
Reader for the good of his owne ſoule, to read what this holy Father writes
of traditions (Lib. 3. C. 4.25.40.) and (Lib. 4. C. 43.) where he hath theſe
remarkeable words; 
<q rend="margQuotes">wherfore we ought to obey thoſe
Prieſts which are in the Church, and haue ſucceſſion from the
Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, who with Epiſcopall ſucceſſion haue receyved the certaine

But others who depart from the principall ſucceſſion, and haue their
conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in what place ſoever, we ought to hold for ſuſpected,
either as Heretikes, and of ill doctrine, or as ſchiſmatikes, and provd,
and pleaſing themſelves, or els as hypocrites, doing theſe things for
lucre and vainglory.</q> And yet further (L. 4. C. 45.) he hath theſe words:
Paul teaching vs where we may find ſuch, (he meanes Faithfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
whom our Lord hath placed ouer his family, of whom he ſpoke in the end of the
precedent 44. Chapter) ſaith; 
<q rend="margQuotes">he placed in his Church firſt,
Apoſtles, ſecondly, Prophets, thirdly Doctours where therfor the gifts of
our Lord are placed, there we ought to learne the truth, with whom there is a
ſucceſſion of the Church from the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and that is conſtantly
kept which is wholſome, vnblemiſhed for converſation,</q> and not
ſpurious but incorruptible in doctrine, (that is, both for manners, and
Faith; affirming, that in neither of thoſe the Church can erre.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">For, thoſe men do keepe our Faith
which is in one God who made all things, and expound to vs the ſcriptures
without danger.</q> And the ſame he ſayth (L. 4 C. 63.) yea even vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker

delivered all things in writing, directly oppoſite to your contrary
Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, ſo often repeated, but without any proofe, which you know is
but to begg the Queſtion? Of people without ſucceſſion of Paſtours,
which is the ground of Tradition, we may truly ſay as Optatus ſaith of the

               </p>
               <p n="166">166. I will make an end of this matter, if firſt I
haue noted, that it is a falſe gloſſe of yours, (like to that which I
haue noted aboue) and directly againſt S. Irenaeus, that when he ſayth;
thoſe Heretiks taught, that <hi>truth cannot be found by thoſe who know not
Tradition, he muſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane ſufficient truth,</hi> as if thoſe heretiks had
agreed with Catholikes, that all truth is not ſufficiently contayned in
ſcripture alone; wheras S. Irenaeus expreſſly declares the doctrine of
thoſe Heretiks to haue been, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that the ſcriptures were not right,
and came not from good authority,</q> but were various one from another, as I
haue ſhewed, and yourſelf affirme in thoſe very words which you
tranſlate out of S. Irenaeus: and ſo not only ſufficient truth could not
be learned in the ſcriptures, but they could not aſſure vs of any truth
at all. Wheras you ſay; (to haue ſayd againſt thoſe Heretiks, <hi>that,
part of the Goſpell which was preached by Peter, was written by S. Mark, and
ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſary parts of it omitted, had been to ſpeake
impertinently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rather to <pb n="244" facs="tcp:59214:131"/>confirme than confute
their errour.</hi> I muſt ſay, that your conſequence is no less
impertinent, than your ſuppoſition is falſe; becauſe no body did ever
go about to confute thoſe Heretiks by ſaying, that part of the Goſpell
was written, and ſome part omitted; but by proving that the ſcriptures were
true, and of infallible authority, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed; and alſo, that
beſide ſcripture, there are true Catholique Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions (oppoſite to the
fooliſh traditions of thoſe Heretiks) from which, truth may be learned:
both which Points S. Irenaeus proves, and ſo confutes the double errour of
thoſe heretiks, that truth could be found, neither by the ſcriptures, nor
by the Traditions of Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques; and therby expreſſly makes good ſuch
Traditions, and that both out of ſcripture and Tradition we may learne ſome
Points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith; which is directly againſt that very thing, for
which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, and proves my chief intent, that ſcripture is not the
only Rule of Faith. To which purpoſe, I beſeech you, heare your owne words
[Pag: 345. N. 29.] where you bring S. Irenaeus [Lib. 3. Cap. 2.] ſpeaking
thus to thoſe Heretiks; <hi>Your calumnyes againſt Scripture are moſt
vnjuſt, but yet moreover aſſure yourſelves, that if you will be tryed
by Tradition, even by that alſo you will be overthrowne. For our Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is farr more famous, more conſtant, and in all reſpects more credible than
that which you pretend to. It were eaſy for me, to muſter vp againſt you
the vninterrupted Succeſſions of all the Churches founded by the
Apoſtles, all conſpiring in their teſtimonyes againſt you: But
becauſe it were too long to number vp the Succeſſions of all Churches, I
will content my ſelf with the Tradition of the moſt Ancient, and moſt
glorious Church of Rome, which alone is ſufficient for the confutation and
confuſion of your doctrine, &amp;c:</hi> Thus you: And though you render very
imperfectly both the words and meaning of S. Irenaeus, and in ſome words
following thoſe which I haue ſett downe, falſify his ſenſe: (And
therfor I beſeech the Reader to examine the place) yet this is ſufficient
to ſhew, by your owne confeſſion, what was the judgment of this glorious
Saint and Martyr concerning Traditions, and the no-neceſſity that all
Poynts of Faith ſhould haue bene written, ſince we may receyue them from
the Church.</p>
               <p n="167">167. By the way: For what myſtery do you goe about to
proue that S. Mark hath written all things neceſſary, becauſe S. Irenaeus
(Lib. 3. Cap. 1.) ſaith; <hi>Mark S. Peters diſciple, delivered to vs in
writing thoſe things which S. Peter had preached;</hi> and yet do not apply
the ſame <pb n="245" facs="tcp:59214:131"/>proof to S. Luke, of whom S. Irenaeus in the
ſame place, ſaith: <hi>Luke a follower of Paul, wrote downe the Goſpell
which had bene preached by him.</hi> (S. Paul.) To what purpoſe would you goe
the further way about, firſt proving, that S. Mark hath all neceſſary
points, and from the nce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring, that S. Luke whoſe Goſpell is larger
than that of S. Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt needs haue written all ſuch things? When as
you might haue imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly proved the ſame thing of S. Luke, of whom S.
Irenaeus ſpeaks in the very ſame manner, as he ſpeaks of S. Mark.</p>
               <p n="168">168. From S. Mark you paſſe to S. John, whom (Pag.
211. N. 42.) you would proue to haue written all neceſſary points,
becauſe he ſaith; <hi>Many other ſignes alſo did Ieſus in the ſight
of his diſciples, which are not written in this Booke: But theſe are
written, that you may belieue that Ieſus is Chriſt the Sonne of God, and
that believing you may haue life in his name,</hi> (John. 20. V 31.) <hi>By
(theſe are written) may be vnderſtood, either thoſe things are written,
or theſe ſignes are written. Take it which way you will, this concluſion
will certainly follow, That either all that which S. Iohn wrote in his
Goſpell, or less then all, and therfor all much more was ſufficient to make
them belieue that which being believed with lively Faith, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
bring them to eternall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="169">169. Anſwer: Of this Text we haue ſpoken already.
Who would ever haue dreamed of this Argument? S. John ſett downe in his
Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell as much of the Miracles which our B. Saviour wrought, as was
ſufficient to oblige men to belieue that he was the Son of God: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for he
ſett downe evidently all things neceſſary to ſalvation; as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
were neceſſary, except the belief of that ſingle Point; or as if none can
be damned if he belieue that Point, which is to ſay, no Chriſtian can be
damned. For, he who believes not Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God, and the
Meſſias, is no Chriſtian. Doth the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Creed conſiſt only of
that Poynt? And yet Potter and you ſay, it containes only things belonging to
Faith. Do not many Heretiks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that Point? Yea if they did not belieue
that Article, they were not Heretikes, but Jewes, Turks, or infidells, and
Apoſttaes from Chriſtian Faith. Suppoſe S. John had written only ſome
Miracles, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to proue Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God, without
mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any other doctrinall point at all, who will ſay, that he had
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſett downe all things neceſſary to ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And S. John
(Epiſt. 1. C. 2. V. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.)
ſaith: 
<q rend="margQuotes">theſe things I write to you that you
may not ſinne: as he ſaith in his Goſpell; Theſe things are written,
that ye may belieue that Jeſus is Chriſt, the ſon of God.</q> Therfor as
you will not ſay, that <pb n="246" facs="tcp:59214:132"/>in that Epiſtle he evidently
ſetts downe all Points of Faith, and other conditions required for keeping
the commandements, and avoyding ſin; but only that he wrote it to that end,
which yet was not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by that Epiſtle alone; ſo although S.
John ſaith (Ep. 1. C. 1.4.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Theſe things we write to you, that your ioy may be full;</q>
yet the contents of that Epiſtle alone could not giue full ioy, which
requires the ſtate of Grace, and obſervation of all things belonging to
Faith and Good life. Nothing is more ordinary than to attribute an effect to
ſome one cauſe, becauſe indeed it is a cauſe, though it alone be not
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to produce ſuch an effect. 
<q rend="margQuotes">He that ſhall belieue, and ſhalbe
bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſhall be ſaved,</q> Mark (16.16.) and yet Hiſtoricall Faith
alone, even according to Calviniſts, togeather with baptiſme, is not
ſufficient for ſalvation. Luther (Poſtilla in Dominic. 5. poſt
Paſch.) ſaith, <hi>Here we ſee, that to belieue in Chriſt, doth not
conſiſt in believing that Chriſt is one Perſon which is God and man.
For, this would availe no man.</hi> Sadeel (Reſp: ad Artic: abjurat: 33. Pag
495.) ſaith; <hi>it is not enough to belieue that Ieſus Chriſt came into
the world; that he ſuffered death; that he roſe againe, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
into Heaven: for, this Hiſtoricall Faith will not ſaue me.</hi> This you
did ſee, and therfor to helpe the matter, you cloſely add, that S. John
wrote <hi>ſufficient to make</hi> men <hi>belieue that which being believed
with lively Faith, would certainly bring them to eternall life.</hi> With
lively Faith? Therfor not by believing that Point alone, Jeſus is the Son of
God. A lively Faith ſignifyes the belief of all other Points of Faith, and
all things neceſſary for keeping all the Commandements; and you ſhould
haue proved, that S. John ſetts downe in his Goſpell evidently all Points
belonging to Faith and manners. Here I muſt put you in mynd, of your
doctrine, that there cannot be given a Catalogue of neceſſary or
fundamentall Points of Faith; and yet it may be eaſily and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily given,
(and you actually give it in this place) if the belief of this Article alone,
Ieſus Chriſt is the Son of God, will certainly bring men to eternall
life.</p>
               <p n="170">170. But indeed is this Poynt which you alledg, cleare
and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in S. Johns Goſpell? You could ſcarcely haue picked out a
place, or Poynt, less for your, and more for our, purpoſe. Do not
Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants differ both from Catholiks and amongſt themſelves about the
Conſubſtantiality, Merit, and Satisfaction of out B. Saviour? And for that
which you ſay was S. Johns prime intent in writing his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, Vt
credatis, That you may belieue, do not you in this, differ from 
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59214:132"/>other Proteſtants toto genere, as much as a belief only
probable and fallible, differs from a moſt certaine and infallible
aſſent? And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the words, that you may haue life in his name, do
not you and your Socinian brethren, differ from other Proteſtants, who
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the Value of our Saviours workes, his Merit, Satisfaction for our
ſinnes, and Redemption of mankind? And ſo (in his name) muſt be
vnderſtood, by different Proteſtants, in a very different ſence, which is
the life of ſcripture. In which maine differences, you in your Principles
will not ſay, but that many, or divers, or at leaſt, ſome, Proteſtants,
do ſincerly ſeeke the true meaning of ſcripture, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for could not
diſagree among themſelves, and from Catholikes, if thoſe words of S. John
were evident, according to your owne Rule. That a thing is not evident, when
men ſo qualifyed, diſagree about it. Catholique Biſhops did overthrow the
Arians, (who made no end of alledging ſcripture for their Hereſy) by
Tradition, and the word homoouſion, which is not found in ſcriprure. And
ſo you could not haue brought any Text of greater ſtrength to proue the
neceſſity of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of a Living Judg, then this, which you alledg
for the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſufficiency of ſcripture alone: and if this Text
itſelf be ſo difficult, how can you by it proue, that all other
neceſſary Points are evident? eſpecially if we reflect on your words
(Pag. 93. N. 106.) That the Evangeliſts wrote not <hi>only for the learned,
but for all men. And therfor that they intended to ſpeake plaine, even to the
capacity of the ſimpleſt.</hi> A pretty paradox! that the ſimpleſt are
able to learne with certainty, out of the bare words of ſcripture alone, the
moſt ſublime myſteryes of Chriſtian Religion, which is more than the
learned can do without obſerving divers Rules exceeding the capacity of the
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned; and yet this abſurdity cannot be avoyded, if ſcriprure alone be
the ſole Rule of Faith: becauſe God hath provided meanes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
both for the learned and vnlearned: and therfor if there be no other meanes
beſide ſcripture, it muſt be cleare to all ſorts of people. What is
this but to caſt men into deſpayre?</p>
               <p n="171">171. By what hath bene ſayd, there offers it ſelf an
eaſy anſwer, to the Objection which you make (Pag. 93. N. 105.) Where
ſpeaking of the Evangeliſts, you ſay: <hi>Can we imagine, that either
they ommitted ſomthing neceſsary out of ignorance, not knowing it to be
neceſſary? Or kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing it to be ſo, maliciouſly concealed it? or out of
negligence did the work they had vndertaken, by halfes? If none of theſe
things can without Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <pb n="248" facs="tcp:59214:133"/>be imputed to them,
conſidering they were asſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt in this worke, then
certainly it moſt evidently followes, that every one of them writt the whole
Goſpell of Chriſt; I meane, all the eſſentiall and neceſſary parts
of it.</hi> In which words you do nothing but begg the Queſtion, ſtill
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the Evangeliſts were obliged to ſet downe in writing
all neceſſary Points of Faith; which though they knew to be neceſſary
to be believed, yet they neither did, nor could know, that they were
neceſſary to be written: which two things you ought to diſtinguiſh,
though it ſeemes you are reſolved never to do ſo. And here alſo you
take vpon you to limit the Goſpell to the eſſentiall and neceſſary
parts of it; of which your voluntary reſtriction I haue already ſayd
enough.</p>
               <p n="172">172. But Sr. I cannot chuſe but aske you, vpon the
occaſion which here you giue; how you can ſay, that ignorance or negligence
cannot without blaſphemy be imputed to the Evangeliſts? ſeing (Pag. 144.
N. 31.) you affirme, that the <hi>Apoſtles even after the ſending of the
Holy Ghoſt, were, and through inadvertence, or prejudice, continued for a
tyme, in an errour repugnant to a revealed truth,</hi> and againſt <hi>our
Saviours express warrant and injunction:</hi> and (Pag. 137. N. 2.) you teach,
that the Church of the Apoſtles tyme, did erre againſt a revealed truth
<hi>through prejudice or inadvertence, or ſome other cauſe;</hi> which
laſt generall reaſon gives ſcope to proceed in blaſphemy (if once we
ſay, that the Apoſtles were not in all things belonging to Faith directed
by the Holy Ghoſt) and for ſuch as you, to ſay, that if they could erre
by inadvertence, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or ſome other cauſes, it was not
impoſſible, but at length one of thoſe other cauſes might grow to be
malice. But more of this herafter. Now I will only touch that which I noted
before, how little credit, or authority your reaſons ought to haue with any
judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſince you acknowledg it to be but probable, that every
one of the Evangelſts hath written all things neceſſary, and yet you
would needs haue your proofes therof to be certaine and evident. Thus we haue
heard you ſay (Pag. 211.42.) <hi>Take it as you will, this concluſion will
certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow, that all that which S. Iohn wrote in his Goſpell was
ſufficient to make them belieue, that which being believed with lively Faith,
would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring them to eternall life.</hi> Vrceus inſtitui coepit,
cur Amphora prodit? A probability improved to a certainty, by the only
ſtrength of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; And (Pag. 93. N. 105.) you ſay; that vnless we
will blaſpheme and accuſe the Evangeliſts either or ignorance, or malice,
or negligence, certainly it moſt evidently follows, that every one of them
writt the <pb n="249" facs="tcp:59214:133"/>whole Goſpell of Chriſt; I meane, all the
eſſentiall and neceſſary parts of it.</p>
               <p n="173">173. Morover, although you pretend to a certainty, that
S. Luke hath written all neceſſary Points, which you hold only probable for
the other three Evangeliſts; yet your reaſon comes to be the ſame for
all, which is, that the Evangeliſts were obliged to write all things
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; or els this (which in effect is all one with the former) what
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n can be imagined, that they ſhould not write all things
neceſſary, and yet ſet downe many things only profitable? For, vnless you
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe this reaſon (which is common to all the Evangeliſts) you
haue no ground to affirme, that the words of S. Luke (all that Jeſus began to
doe and teach) muſt ſignify determinately all neceſſary things, as I
haue often ſayd; and ſo vppon the matter, you haue the ſame reaſon for
all the foure Evangeliſts, which is no more then the ſame begging of the
Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="174">174. But what need we vſe many reaſons? Our eyes can
witness, that the Evangeliſts haue not written all neceſſary Points of
Faith. For, (to omitt, that they haue not ſet downe the matter and forme of
Sacraments, the forme of Government of the Church, the power of inflicting
cenſures, and many ſuch Points, which cannot be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proved out of
ſcripture alone, without the aſſiſtance of traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) we do not find
clearly expreſſed in S. Matthew the Eternall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Son of God,
wherwith S. Iohn beginnes his Goſpell, 
<q rend="margQuotes">In the beginning was the word
&amp;c.</q> S. Mark is ſilent of the Incarnation of our Lord in the wombe of
the B. Virgin by vertue of the Holy Ghoſt; His Birth, and all other
Myſteryes of his ſacred life till his age of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares. S Luke, as
alſo S Mark; omits the giving power to forgiue ſins. (Ioan. 20. V. 22.23.)
and (Matth. 18. V. 18.) which is a chief Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Creed, I beleeue the
remiſſion of ſinnes. S. Iohn wrote no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Annuntiation,
Nativity, Circumciſion, Epiphany, and Aſcenſion of our Saviour Chriſt;
and according to Proteſtants, he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes not of the Euchariſt. For, they
deny that [Cap. 6.] he ſpeakes of that Sacrament: And conſequently,
communion vnder both kinds, which they hold to be a Divine precept, and
therfore neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is omitted by him; as alſo our Lords
prayer. All of them haue omitted in their Goſpells, that which is
expreſſed [Act. 2.] about the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt; and the
Decrees of the Councell of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, (Act. 15.) wherin amongſt other
things, they declare, that it <pb n="250" facs="tcp:59214:134"/>was not neceſſary to
obſerue the Moſaicall Law, which is a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and neceſſary
point. I haue bene longer in anſwering this objection, as contayning many
heads and divers Arguments of the ſame nature, which I thought beſt not to
divide. Let vs now ſee what more you can object.</p>
               <p n="175">175. Object 3. (Pag: 93. N. 105.) If men cannot
vnderſtand by ſcripture, <hi>enough for their ſalvation, why then doth S.
Paul ſay to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, the ſcriptures are able to make him wiſe vnto
ſalvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="376">376. Anſwer: Firſt, It is not ſayd, the
ſcriptures alone are able to make one wiſe to ſalvation: And if you had
dealt honeſtly, and not conceald what went before and after, it would haue
been cleare, that S. Paul ſpeakes not of ſcripture alone; and of what
ſcripture he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes; and how ſcripture may inſtruct to ſalvation;
which points being well conſidered, it will appeare, that this Text is ſo
farr from proving what you intend, that it makes againſt you. S. Paul (V 14.
and 15.) ſaith; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Tu vero permane, &amp;c. But thou
continue in thoſe things which thou haſt learned, and are committed to thee
knowing of whom thou haſt learned; and becauſe from thy infancy thou haſt
knowen the holy ſcriptures, which can inſtruct thee to ſalvation, by the
Faith that is in Chriſt Ieſus.</q> In which words S. Paul ſpeakes of
things which Timothy had learned of him (though out of humility a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d modeſty
he concealed, his owne name as he doth 2. Cor. 12.2. 
<q rend="margQuotes">ſcio hominem &amp;c I know a man in
Chriſt aboue fourteen yeares agoe, &amp;c.)</q> beſide ſcriptures, which
Timothy had knowen from his infancy; therfore he ſpeakes not of ſcripture
taken alone, or without a Teacher, and ſo it can only be inferred, that
ſcripture or the word written, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the vnwritten word, is
ſufficient to inſtruct vnto ſalvation. But beſides this, of what
ſcriptures doth S. Paul ſpeake? Of thoſe in which S. Timothy had been
converſant from his infancy, which could be only the ſcriptures of the Old
Teſtament, and therfor that which S. Paule delivered by word of mouth, muſt
containe many more Points concerning Chriſtian Religion, than Timothy could
learne evidently, diſtinctly, and in particular by the Old Teſtament alone.
Of that maine Point, which one would think ſhould be moſt cleare, that
Chriſt our Lord is the true Meſſias, the Eunuch ſayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how can
I (vnderſtand) without an interpreter? Which yet he might haue done, if
ſcripture in that fundamentall Point had bene evident, according to the Axiom
of the Socinians, he needs no guide who clearly and certainly kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes

belieue in Chriſt, being rightly interpreted; but it alone is not ſo
evident as you pretend ſcripture to be. The ſtarre which appeared to the
three Sages, had not bene ſufficient to call and direct them to Bethleem,
without ſome other helpe; as that tradition,

cleare without the declaration of the Clergy of that tyme; which declaration
they alſo received by tradition. Wherby it appeares, that when it is ſayd;
The ſcriptures can inſtruct thee vnto ſalvation, this being ſpoken of
the Old Teſtament only, can ſignify no more then that they may helpe to
that effect, but not that they alone are ſufficient, which is the thing you
ſhould proue. Which may be confirmed by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that S Paul doth as
it were prevent an Objection, or Demand which might be made: why doth the
Apoſtle exhort Timothy to be conſtant in thoſe things, which he had
learned out of the ſcriptures, of the Old Teſtament, if they be not
ſufficient to make a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? To which, S. Paul anſwers, that although
thoſe ſcriptures alone be not ſufficient, yet they are profitable. And
this he proves, in the next verſe (16.17.) becauſe all ſcripture being
inſpired by God, is profitable to teach &amp;c. And therfor nothing can be
gathered from this place to proue the ſufficiency of ſcripture alone. Which
appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares alſo by thoſe words which the Apoſtle adds; 
<q rend="margQuotes">per Fidem &amp;c. by Faith which is in
Chriſt Jeſus,</q> declaring that the Old Teſtament may inſtruct to
ſalvation, not taken alone, but with the helpe of a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher expounding it
according to the Analogy of Chriſtian Religion: and ſo this Text proves,
that beſides ſcripture, a Living Guide is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: 
<q rend="margQuotes">which is alſo proved by thoſe
words: (2. Tim. 3.14.) But thou continue in thoſe things which thou haſt

promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated: which interpretation he proves out of the Greeke. And ſo it
ſtill appeares more and more, even by this place of S. Paul, that more is to
be believed, than is contayned particularly in ſcripture; as alſo we learne
out of the ſame Apoſtle, (2. Teſſalon: 2.15.)

them ſo, that their writings ſhould be fit and ſufficient to attaine that
end they aymed at in writing? For, if he were both able and willing to do ſo,
then certainly he did ſo. And then their writings may be very ſufficient
meanes, if we would vſe them as we ſhould doe, to preſerue vs in vnity in
all neceſſary Points of Faith, and to guard vs from all pernitious
Error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="178">178. Anſwer: As you are ſtill begging the
Queſtion, ſo I may not faile to be putting you in mynd, that you do ſo.
You ſhould proue, and not take as granted, that the intent of the Apoſtles
was to conſerue vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith, and to keepe vs from errour by their
writings, taken alone, without any vnwritten word, or Tradition. Our Queſtion
is, whether all neceſſary particular Points be evidently contayned in
Scripture alone: if they be not ſo contained; then it followes, that the
ſcripture alone, can neither conſerue vs in vnity, nor preſerue vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
errour in thoſe points of which it ſayes nothing, but for ſuch things,
all will proceed, as if there were no ſcripture, therfore you muſt
ſuppoſe all neceſſary things to be contayned in ſcripture, before you
can affirme, that the intent of the Apoſtles was to conſerue vnity, and to
keep vs from errour, by their writings alone; that is, you muſt begg, that
which you know is denyed. The Holy Ghoſt was both able, and willing, ſo to
direct the Apoſtles and all Canonicall Writers, that their writings ſhould
be fit and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to attaine that end they aymed at in writing, and
certainly he did doe ſo. But you haue nor proved that they aymed at that end,
which <pb n="253" facs="tcp:59214:135"/>not the Holy Ghoſt, nor the Apoſtles moved by
his inſpiration, ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at, but which you only preſume to preſcribe, for
making good your errour. You ſay; the ſcriptures may be very ſufficient
meanes if we would vſe them as we ſhould doe, to preſerue vs in vnity,
&amp;c. But experience teaching, that by not following a Living Guide, no vnity
can be hoped for by ſcripture alone; to vſe them as we ſhould doe, is not
for every one to follow his owne interpretation, but that of Gods Church. And
it is an injury to the inſinite wiſdom of our B. Saviour, to imagine, that
he left that, for a ſufficient Meanes to conſerue Vnity, which hitherto
neither hath had, nor ever will, nor ever can haue that effect, without a
perpetuall, great, and vnuſuall Miracle, by making men, different in all
other things, agree in the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. You will not deny, but that
while the Apoſtles and other Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall writers were aliue, the ſcripture,
ioined with ſuch explication as they could giue by word of mouth, or by
writing new bookes, was ſitter to conſerue vnity, then now it is: and, by
not making vſe of ſuch help of ſome authenticall interpreter, it is
ſayd of the Epiſtles of S. Paul, (2. Pet. 3 V. 16.) that there were in them
ſome hard things to be vnderſtood, which, vnlearned and inconſtant
perſons did depraue to their owne perdition, as they did alſo other
Scriptures. Now the Church ſupplyes that want of the Apoſtles perſonall
preſence: And ſo we may ſay of all Controverſyes in Faith, as S.
Auſtine (de vnit: Eccles: C. 22.) writes concerning the Queſtion about
Rebaptization of ſuch as were baptized by Heretikes: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Seing we find not in Scripture, that
ſome pass to the Church from heretiks, and were receyved, as I ſay, or as
thou ſayeſt, I ſuppoſe, that if there were any wiſe man of whom our

que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, we ſhould make no doubt to performe what he ſhould ſay,
leaſt we might feeme to gainſay, not him ſo much as Chriſt, by whoſe

               <p n="179">179. To your demand; <hi>Why may not the Apoſtles
writings be as fit meanes to conſerue vs in vnity, and keep vs from errour,
as the Decrees of the Church?</hi> The Anſwer is eaſy and cleare. Firſt,
If one Decree be obſcure, it may be declared by another, ſeing the church
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> never periſh. 2. If any new co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy in faith ariſe, the Church,
alwayes living and preſent, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <pb n="254" facs="tcp:59214:136"/>it by ſome
new Decree or Declaration. Theſe conditions are wanting in ſcripture, which
is alwayes the ſame, and wilbe no more cleare, or of any larger extent for
the contents therof, to morrow, than it is to day; nor can 'it ſpeake and
declare it ſelf by it ſelfe, but only can be declared by ſome living Judg
or Interpreter. And you are in a great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, if you conceiue that we hold
any one Writing or Decree, to be ſufficient for deciding all Controverſyes;
But we ſay, that the Church vpon ſeverall exigents can declare her mynd,
either by explicating former Decrees, or by promulgating new ones, as
neceſſity ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And for this cauſe, there are extant ſo
many Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, &amp;c: If we did yield to any one writing the
ſufficiency of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all emergent Controverſyes, God forbid we ſhould
deny it to hò<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcripture! Neither do we diſtinguiſh Tradition
from the written word, becauſe Tradition is not written by any, or in any
booke or writing; but becauſe it is not written in the ſcripture or Bible.
For Tradition hath this advantage, that it may be both written and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by word of mouth; and ſo be certainly conſerved. By theſe
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, is anſwered an Objection which you make againſt ſome
words of <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> and it ſhall be.</p>
               <p n="180">180. Object: 5. [Pag: 54. N. 5.] You are pleaſed to
ſpeak to your Adverſary in this manner: <hi>In the next words</hi> (of
<hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> Part: 1. Chap: 2. N. 1.) <hi>we haue direct Boyes-play, a
thing given with one hand, and taken away with the other; an acknowledgment
made in one line, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in the next. We acknowledg (ſay you)
Scripture to be a perfect rule, for as much as a writing can be a Rule: Only we
deny that it excludes vnwritten Tradition. As if you ſhould haue ſayd, we
acknowledg it to be as perfect a Rule, as a writing can be; only we deny it to
be as perfect a rule as a writing may be. Either therfor you muſt revoke your
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, or retract your retraction of it; for both cannot posſibly
ſtand togeather. For, if you will ſtand to what you haue granted, That
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is as perfect a rule of Faith, as a writing can be: You muſt then
grant it both ſo compleat, that it needes no addition, and ſo evident, that
it needs no interpretation. Now that a writing is capable of both theſe
perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> (you ſay N. 7.) <hi>is ſo plaine, that I am even
aſhamed to proue it. For he that denyes it, muſt ſay, That ſomething
may be ſpoken which cannot be written. For if ſuch a compleat and evident
rule of Faith may be delivered by word of mouth, as you pretend it may, and is;
and whatſoever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by word of mouth, may alſo be written, then
ſuch a compleat and <pb n="255" facs="tcp:59214:136"/>evident rule of Faith may alſo be
written. Anſwer me; Whether your Church can ſet downe in writing all
theſe, which ſhe pretends to be Divine vnwritten Traditions and add them to
the verityes already written? And whether ſhe can ſet vs downe ſuch
interpretations of all obſcurityes in Faith, as ſhall need no farther
interpretations? If ſhee can; let her doe it, and then we ſhall haue a
writing, not only capable of, but actually endowed with both theſe
perfections, of being both ſo compleat as to need no Addition, and ſo
evident as to need no Interpretation. Laſtly, no man can without Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
deny that Chriſt Ieſus, if he had pleaſed, could haue writ vs a rule of
Faith ſo plaine and perfect, as that it ſhould haue wanted neither any part
to make vp its integrity, nor any clearness to make it ſufficiently
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and then a writing there might haue been endowed with both
theſe propertyes.</hi>

               <p n="181">181. Anſwer I haue had the patience to ſet downe
your words much more at large, than was needfull: the anſwer having been
given already; that no one writing, can without a great and vnvſuall

no ſuch matter, as will appeare anone. But firſt I muſt tell you, that
you cite <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> very diſadvantagiouſly, or rather falſely,
thus: <hi>We acknowledg ſcripture to be a perfect Rule, for as much as a

and here you ſtopp; wheras He added; <hi>We only deny, that it excludes
either divine Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, though it be vnwritten, or an externall judge to

propoſe itſelf to be Authenticall, <pb n="256" facs="tcp:59214:137"/>and much less
infallible, and divine, or can keep and preſerue it ſelf from corruption.
Seing then you grant, that no writing alone can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme theſe things, it
followes, that ſcripture cannot do them. Or if any one writing can do ſo, I
hope, you, and Proteſtants who pretend ſo much to reverence ſcripture,
will not hold it any great crime in <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> to haue ſayd, that if

               <p n="182">182. But here (Pag: 55. N. 8.) you make an Objection
againſt <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> in theſe words: <hi>You will ſay, that though a
writing be never ſo perfect a Rule of Faith, yet it muſt be beholding to
Tradition to giue it this teſtimony that it is a Rule of Faith, and the word
of God. I anſwer: Firſt, There is no abſolute necesſity of this. For,
God might giue it the atteſtation of perpetuall miracles. Secondly: That it
is one thing to be a perfect Rule of Faith; another, to be proved ſo vnto vs.
And thus, though a writing could not be proved to vs to be a perfect rule of
Faith, by its owne ſaying ſo, for nothing is proved true by being ſayd or
written in a booke, but only, by Tradition, which is a thing credible of it
ſelf; yet it may be ſo in it ſelf, and containe all the materiall
Objects, all the particular Articles of our Faith, without any dependance vpon
Tradition; even this alſo not excepted, that this writing doth contayne the
Rule of Faith. Now when Proteſtants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme againſt Papiſts, that
Scripture is a perfect Rule of Faith, their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not, that by Scripture
all things abſolutely, may be proved, which are to be believed. For, it can
never be proved by Scripture to a gainſayer, that there is a God, or that the
booke called Scripture, is the word of God. For, he that will deny theſe
Aſſertion; when they are ſpeken, will belieue them never a whitt the more
becauſe you can ſhew them written: But their meaning is, that the
Scripture, to them which preſuppoſe it Divine, and a Rule of Faith, as
Papiſts and Proteſtants doe, contaynes all the materiall Objects of Faith;
is a compleat and totall, and not only an imperfect and partiall Rule.</hi>

of which none can be more eſſentially neceſſary, then that ſuch a

as hath been ſhewed out of your owne words; though now in your Firſt

impertinently to the purpoſe, in ſaying; <hi>there is no abſolute
necesſity that a writing be beholding to Tradition, to giue it this

Sr., Reflect that the Queſtion is, whether any writing alone can giue to it

and if God ſhould doe it by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, it were not done by a writing alone,

every where that we can know by Tradition only, that Scripture is the word of

Which according to you were not true if de facto God did <hi>give it the

muſt be beholding to tradition to giue it this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that it is the

know Scripture to be the word of God? Beſides, if you will fly to Gods
Omnipotent Povver in vvorking Miracles, for excluding the neceſſity of
Tradition and a Living Judge, you may eaſe men of all diſpute about
Scripture, or neceſſity therof, ſeing God can direct every man vvithout
Scripture by perpetuall Miracles, and make all as infallible in their Thoughts,
as the Apoſtles vvere in <pb n="258" facs="tcp:59214:138"/>their words and writings, We
ought therfor to ſpeake of things as they are, and according to their
natures, and the way which God hath ſet downe; without recourſe to a meere
poſſibility of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, againſt Experience teaching that He workes not
ſuch imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wonders. Wherby I come now to proue, that it is not only
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any writing alone to propoſe, or proue, and conſerue it
ſelf, but alſo to interpret its owne meaning; becauſe as <hi>Cha:
Ma:</hi> ſaith, (Part: 1. Chap: 2. N. 3.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">It muſt be, as all writings are,
deafe, dumbe, inanimate, and being alwayes the ſame, cannot declare it ſelf
any one tyme, or vpon any occaſion more particularly than v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any other;
and let it be redd over an hundred tymes, it will be ſtill the ſame, and no
more fit alone to terminate Controverſyes in Faith, than the Law would be to
end ſuites, if it were given over to the phanſy, and gloſſe of every
ſingle man.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="184">184. And this which hath bene ſayd in generall of any
one wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, is in a particular manner to be affirmed of Holy Scripture, or of
any writing contayning Divine and ſublime Myſteryes, which ſeeme
repugnant to naturall Reaſon. For, the height of ſuch truthes moves the
will, and perſwades the vnderſtanding, to ſeek out any ſenſe of
words, though orherwiſe ſeeming cleare, rather then to belieue things
ſeeming evidently contrary to Reaſon. Beſides, ſeing (as I alledged out
of Doctour Taylour in his §. 3. N. 2.) words may be taken in a
<hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall or ſpirituall ſenſe, and both theſe ſenſes are
ſubdivided; For the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſenſe is either naturall or figuratiue:
And the ſpirituall is ſometymes allegoricall, ſomtymes anagogicall, nay,
ſomtymes there are divers litterall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the ſame ſentence, as
appeares in divers quotations in the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, where the Apoſtles and
Divine Writers bring the ſame Teſtimony to divers purpoſes;</hi> Seing, I
ſay, this is ſo; how it is poſſible, that any one writing, can be ſo
evident, both for words, and meaning, that all men by only reading the ſame
words, muſt be neceſſitated to take them in the ſame ſenſe,
literall, ſpirituall; naturall, figuratiue; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoricall, anagogicall; and
that even of divers literall ſenſes of the ſame Text, every perſon
muſt ſee all; which if he do not, he may miſſe in one, though he chance
to hitt right in another; ſince there cannor poſſibly be aſſigned any
infallible Rule, (which yet is neceſſary for ſettling an Act of Faith) to
know in particular, when and where, words capable of ſo many and ſo
different meanings, are determinately to be vnderſtood in this, or that,
ſenſe? If <pb n="259" facs="tcp:59214:138"/>you ſay, God might put a remedy to this
diverſity of meanings, by ſetling the indetermination or diverſity of
mens vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, with perpetuall Miracles, effectually keeping them all
to the ſame judgment of all the ſame places, or ſubtracting his
concurſe to all contrary aſſents: I anſwer, this would be, a ſtrang
kind of proceeding, or Miracle; neither would it make any thing to your
purpoſe, becauſe, as I ſayd, we ſpeake of a writing taken alone,
without Miracle, or Tradition. And ſeing de facto God workes no ſuch
Miracle, as we ſee by Experience in the diſagreements of Chriſtians
concerning places of Scripture, which for the words ſeeme very evident; it
followes, that both for the divinity, and Interpretation, or true meaning of
Scripture, we muſt depend on Tradition, or a Living Judge. And thus is
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered your Argument; that <hi>no man can without Blaſphemy deny that
Chriſt Ieſus, could haue writ vs a Rule of Faith ſo plaine and perfect,
as that it ſhould haue wanted neither any part to make vp its integrity, nor
any clearness to make it ſufficiently intelligible.</hi> For I grant, that
our Saviour could by Miracle haue procured, that all men ſhould frame the
ſame Judgment of the ſame words; but deny that this could haue happened
infallibly, by meanes of any one writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which is our preſent
Queſtion; and your having recourſe to our Saviours extraordinary Power,
proves the very thing to be true which I affirme; that it cannot be done by any
one writing alone. And when <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſayd <hi>we
acknowledg Holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be a moſt perfect Rule for as much as a
writing can be a Rule,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſees by the whole drift of his
diſcovrſe, and plain words, that he ſpoke of a writing alone, and
conſidered according to the nature therof, and in that courſe which God de
facto holds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dreaming of Metaphyſicall ſuppoſitions of your
imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or of flying to ſuch Miracles as God neither hath, nor (for
ought we can vvith any ſhadow of reaſon imagine,) ever vvill worke
vniverſally in the vnderſtandings of all men, to belieue with certainty the
particular dogmaticall ſenſe of words, for the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wherof,
they haue no certaine vniverſall Rule, either evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeene by Reaſon,
or certainly believeed by revelation. It is alſo evident, that when <hi>Cha:
Ma:</hi> ſpoke the aforeſayd words, of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, He compared it not with
all writings, which ſucceſſively <pb n="260" facs="tcp:59214:139"/>and without end,
may interpret or declare one an other, but with any one writing taken alone,
which, as I haue proved, can not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly propoſe, conſerue, or
interpret itſelf. For as Scripture, or the Bible, is one whole work or booke,
ſo it ought to be compared only with one other writing or booke; as alſo He
ſpoke of a writing, as it is contradiſtinguiſhed from Tradition, or a
perpetuall Living Judg. But if you will be ſuppoſing a multiplication, or
as it were ſucceſſiue addition of a latter writing to extend or declare
the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, you are out of our caſe of a ſole writing, and joyne a writing
with a Living Writer and Judg, and ſo grant perforce the very thing which we
affirme, and you pretend to deny. If the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les were ſtill Living to
declare their former writings by word of mouth, or new Scriptures, we needed no
other Living Judg: but ſeing they are deceaſed, and no one writing is
ſufficient to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it ſelfe, we muſt haue recourſe to ſome
preſent, alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent, and Living Judg, for determining
Controverſyes of Faith, and interpreting Holy Scripture. I belieue, the
vnpartiall Reader will Judge, that which you call Boyes-play, to haue turned in
good earneſt to a greater diſadvantage to yourſelfe and your cauſe,
than you imagined: And that your Arguments are of no force to proue, that any
one writing can of it ſelf be a perfect Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p n="185">185. We grant, that whatſoever is ſpoken, may be
written, and affirme, that as no one writing, ſo no one ſpeech, can be a
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Rule of Faith, but both the one and the other ſtand in need of
ſome other ſpeach, or writing to declare them, as occaſion ſhall
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: neither do we pretend that the Church can ſet downe in any one
writing all traditions, and Interpretations, or Declarations of all things
belonging to Faith; but ſhe can, and will, by ſeverall writings declare
Doubts, as they ſhall occurre neceſſary to be determined. You ſay:
<hi>Neither is that an Interpretation, which needs againe to be
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted;</hi> as if a word or writing, or Interpretation, might not be
cleare for ſome part, and yet need a further Declaration in ſome other
reſpect, or point, or purpoſe, or for ſuch as did not fully vnderſtand
the firſt Interpretation: And as you ſay; <hi>it is one thing to be a
perfect Rule of Faith, another to be proved ſo vnto vs,</hi> ſo it is one
thing to be a true, yea a full Interpretation in it ſelf, another to appeare
ſo without addition of ſome other declaration; as alſo the firſt
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation <pb n="261" facs="tcp:59214:139"/>may giue ſome light, yet to be further
perfited by ſome ſubſequent expoſition. None can deny, that the
Canonicall Writers of the New Teſtament, alledging ſome paſſages of the
Old (and by alledging them to a certaine purpoſe, they interpret and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
them to ſignify that for which they alledge them) are not alway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſo
cleare in every reſpect as that they may not require ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
or Explication, as we ſee performed by Holy Fathers, and Interpreters of
ſcripture, who ſomtyme find difficulty, even in fynding in the Old
Teſtament, what is cited out of it; and we have heard out of a Proteſtant
Doctour that <hi>The Apoſtles and divine Writers bring the ſame Teſtimony
to divers</hi> purpoſes; which ſhewes, that every interpretation doth not
adequate the ſenſe: yea ſince ſome Proteſtants, hold that the ſame
Text of Scripture cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſeverall true and different ſenſes (as
Fulk in his Confutation of Purgatory, (Pag: 151.) and Willet in his Synopſis,
(Pag: 26.) they muſt aknowledg great difficulty in the interpretation of the

purpoſes, as Divine Writers haue done, and will be forced to giue ſome
interpretation or declaration of thoſe very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent interpretations, which
Canonicall Writers gaue of thoſe Texts of the Old Teſtament. Thus your
Arguments being clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, I muſt put you in mynd of ſome Points on
which I belieue you did not reflect, and which will proue, that it is not
<hi>Char: Main:</hi> but yourſelf who <hi>giue a thing with one hand, and
take it away with the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="186">186. In your firſt Anſwer to an Objection which you
make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt yourſelf (Pag: 55 N. 8.) you ſay: God might giue a writing
the <hi>atteſtation of perpetuall Miracles, that it is a Rule of Faith, and
the word of God.</hi> This you giue heer; and yet you take it away in your
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your Third Motiue to be a Roman Catholike; where you ſay;
<hi>the Bible hath bene confirmed with thoſe ſupernaturall and divine
Meracies, which were wrought by our Saviour Chriſt, and his Apoſtles;</hi>
and <hi>add; It ſeemes to me no ſtrang thing, that God in his Iuſtice
ſhould permit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true Miracles to be wrought to delude them, who haue
forged ſo many, as apparently the profeſſours of the Roman Doctrine haue,
to abuſe the world.</hi> The ſame you expreſſly deliver (Pag 379. N.
69) Now, if even true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles may be wrought, to delude any ſort of people,
certainly they might haue been wrought to delude the Jewes, who deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and impugned the Miracles of our Saviour Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, 
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59214:140"/>and denyed Chriſt to be the true Meſſias, and
forged falſe witneſſes to put Him to death, and diſcredit his Doctrine.
Nay, what People, or what ſingle Perſon can be ſure that their ſinnes
haue not deſerved ſuch a puniſhment? Every deadly ſinne vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
will certainly be puniſhed with eternall torments, which is the greateſt
evill that can be imagined, or rather ſo great, that it cannot be imagined by
any mortall man; and therfor much more may every ſuch ſinne be juſtly
puniſhed by permitting true Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be wrought, to delude the ſinner,
if once that be granted which you affirme. How then could our Saviour ſay,
(John 10.38.) If you will not belieue me, belieue the workes? Or doth not this
open a way to affirme, that the Miracles of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, haue
beene wrought to delude men? And finally, to come cloſe to our purpoſe, how
could God giue any certaine atteſtation by any Miracle, that Scripture is the
word of God, if true Miracles may be done to delude men? And how do you ſay
in your Anſwer to your ſayd Third Motiue to be a Roman Catholike; The Bible
de facto hath bene <hi>confirmed with thoſe Supernaturall and Divine Miracles
which were wrought by our Saviour Chriſt, and his Apoſtles?</hi> Is not
this, with one hand to giue Scripture the prerogatiue of being the word of God,
and with the other to take it away? In the meane tyme; I challeng all the
enemyes of the Roman Church, to ſhew any one Miracle-forged and approved by
Her; and yourſelf know, that ſhe cenſures with excommunication broachers
of falſe Miracles, as <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part 1. Chap. 3. N. 9.)
ſhewes, and you in your Anſwer deny it not, it being notorious to the whole
world, that ſuch forgers are moſt ſeverely puniſhed in Catholique
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes.</p>
               <p n="187">187. In another reſpect alſo, you giue and take
away. Here you tell vs, that God might giue ſcripture the <hi>Atteſtation
of perpetuall Miracles, that it is the word of God:</hi> and in your Anſwer
to your third Motiue as I ſayd even now, you ſay, that the ſcripture hath
bene <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with thoſe innumerous, ſupernaturall, and Divine
Miracles, which were wrought by our Saviour Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</hi>
If this be ſo, we muſt inferr that as the particular contents of
ſcripture; for example, the Incarnation, Life, Death, Reſurtection, and
Aſcenſion of our Saviour Chriſt &amp;c: being confirmed by Miracles,
became materiall Objects of our Faith; ſo ſeing you confeſſe this Truth
<hi>(The Bible <pb n="263" facs="tcp:59214:140"/>is the word of God)</hi> to be proved by
the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, it followes evidently, that it is
a materiall Object of Faith, no less then the particular Truths which it
contaynes. Andthis your ſelfe affirme in this very place, in your Second
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, where you ſay; by <hi>Scriptures not all things abſolutely may
be proved which are to be believed: For it can never be proved by Scripture to
a gainſayer, that there is a God, or that the Book called Scripture, is the
word of God.</hi> Is not this to ſay, that one of the things which cannot be
proved by Scripture, and yet are to be believed, is, that Scripture is the word
of God. Therfor, <hi>we are to belieue, that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the word of
God:</hi> and what is this but to be a materiall Object of our Faith? This, I
ſay, you teach here. But in other places, you affirme and take care to proue,
that Scripture is not one of the materiall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Faith, as ſhall
appeare in my next Chapter.</p>
               <p n="188">188. You do alſo overthrow what we haue heard you
ſay, that Miracles may be wrought to delude men, by the contrary doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
delivered (Pag: 144. N. 31.) in theſe words: <hi>It is impoſſible that
God ſhould lye and that the Eternall Truth ſhould ſet his hand and
ſeale to the Confirmation of a falſhood, or of ſuch Doctrine as is partly
true and partly falſe. The Apoſtles Doctrine was thus confirmed, therfor it
was intirely true, and in no part either falſe or vncertaine.</hi> But how is
this true, if the Apoſtles might haue bene permitted to worke even true
Miracles to delude men; or how is not their Doctrine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, if you cannot
be certaine but that their Miracles were wrought to ſuch an end of deluding
men? How many wayes are you fallen into that which you objected to your
Adverſary as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Boyes-play? Giving, taking away; ſaying, vnſaying,
and in a vvord, contradicting yourſelf; not in any by-point, or incident

as I ſayd, you cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that B. Saint, becauſe he is ſo great a

being but exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and effects of heate in diſputation; wheras of all
thoſe holy, learned, and pious volumes of his, none can be of greater profit
to Gods Church, then thoſe which he wrote againſt the Donatiſts, who were
Schiſmatikes from, and impugners of the ſame Church. It is well (though
this alſo be wickedly done on your behalfe) you confess that S. Auſtine did
ranſack all places for Arguments againſt the Donatiſts; and yet we ſee
he finally reſted vpon the Churches authority, and not vpon ſcripture;
which directly proues for vs, that after all diligence vſed, he comes to

indeed that Doctrine be not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely certaine, ſince it were to hazard
the ſalvation of infants and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; beſides that S. Auſtine
confeſſes, that the baptizing of Children is not grounded vpon ſcripture,

<q rend="margQuotes">If there were any <pb n="268" facs="tcp:59214:143"/>wiſe man of whom our Saviour had given Teſtimony, and that he

Chriſt beareth witness to his Church.</q> Behold S. Auſtine ſpeaks of the
Queſtion, or Doctrine it ſelf, and not only of examples, or what was
practiſed by the Church, and therfor ſaith, we ſhould not doubt to
performe even for tyme to come, what a wiſe man, of whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had
given Teſtimony, ſhould adviſe, and not only to belieue him, that ſuch
a thing was, or was not, practiſed before. Now S. Auſtine ſaith that
Chriſt beares witness to the Church, as vpon ſuppoſition he had done to
ſome wiſe man; therfor we are to belieue the Church as we would belieue
ſuch a man ſo recommended, whom certainly we ought to belieue both for
matter of Fact, and Faith, or Doctrine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, if S. Auſtine did alledg
the Church only as a witness of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Argument were of no force to
eſtabliſh a Point of Faith, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he did ſuppoſe the Church could not
erre in delivering what hath bene a perpetuall Tradition, and that the Point
delivered by ſuch a Tradition, muſt be true, and conſequently that the
Doctrine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the vniverſall Church cannot be falſe. It had bene a

hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes delivered as a perpetuall practiſe, or tradition, that
perſons bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Heretiks are not to bee rebaptized; But the church may
erre in that which is certaine ſhe does practiſe: therfor it is certaine
that perſons baptized by Heretiks may not be rebaptized. And is it not a
great injury to impute ſuch an Argument to that learned and Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? If
the Church may practiſe a thing vnlawful what neerer are we by knowing the
practiſe of the Church for our direction in order to the imbracing, or
avoyding ſuch a pactiſe? And therfor S. Auſtine propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the
practiſe of the Church, as a Rule and direction, what we are to follow,
ſuppoſes the Church cannot erre in the Doctrine on which ſuch a
practiſe depends; as all practiſe depends vpon ſome dictamen of the
vnderſtanding. The ſame is evident by other ſayings of S. Auſtine, as
[Epiſt: 118.] 
<q rend="margQuotes">Which of theſe things is to be done
if the authority of Holy Scripture hath preſcribed, we muſt not doubt but
that we ought to doe accordingly &amp;c: as likewiſe if the Church through

practiſes; eſpecially when the Queſtion is, whether ſuch a thing be to
be believed as a Point of Faith, which muſt rely vpon certainty? And we are
to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that S. Auſtine ſpeakes of what ought to be done, and not
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of matter of Fact; which is cleare by his words, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Quod horum ſit faciendum, Which of

or was not practiſed, but alſo that the thing in it ſelf was lawfull: and
then he ſayth, that beſide ſcripture, we ought to imbrace, and not to

S. Auſtine by <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part 1. Chap. 3. N. 16.) as alſo
out of S. Chryſoſtome, who treating (theſe words (2. Thess. 2.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Stand and hold the traditions which you

Whitaker were alledged in the ſame place by <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> but
are diſſembled by you, who (Pag. 153. N. 45.46.) giue two ſlight
anſwers to the ſayd words of S. Chriſoſtome: the firſt is like to
that which in the firſt place you gaue to the words of S. Auſtine; that
<hi>I was to proue the Church infallible, not in her Traditions, but in all her
decrees and difinitions of Controverſyes:</hi> Which anſwer I haue confuted
already; and it is directly contrary to S. Chriſoſtome, who not only
ſayth, that we are to belieue the church affirming ſuch, or ſuch a thing
to haue bene delivered, but alſo, that the things ſo delivered are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of belief, as he ſayd of things delivered by the Apoſtles without Writing,
and to be believed in ſuch manner, as we are to ſeek no more. Therfor we
are to rely on the churches Tradition, as vpon a ſure and certaine ground or
Rule of Faith. It was not without cauſe, that Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aker a man of ſo great
note in England was ſo angry with S. Chriſoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</p>
               <p n="203">203. Your ſecond Anſwer is; That the things
<hi>Which the Apoſtles delivered without writing, are worthy of belief, if we
know what they were:</hi> Which is not to anſwer, but to deride S.
Chryſoſtome, as if he ſpoke of a Chimera, and not of any thing of vſe,
or exiſtent, and applicable to practiſe, and in ſtead of ſaying as he
doth: 
<q rend="margQuotes">It is a Tradition, ſeeke no more, it
is worthy of belief.</q> He ſhould haue ſayd, There is no ſuch thing as
Tradition, ſeeke it not, nor belieue it. Beſides, in this very conditionall
grant, that we were to belieue Tradition of the Church, and the things which
ſhe delivers as true, you grant the Church to be indued with infallibility,
as I may ſay, habitually; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we could not belieue her Traditions,
or that the things which ſhe delivers, are true, though ſhe were
ſuppoſed to deliver them. Now if once it be granted, that the Church is
infallible, not only as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of what hath bene done, but alſo of what
ought to be done, that is of Fact and Faith, of Practiſe and Speculation; we
haue as much as we deſire, to wit, that the Church cannot erre in her
Traditions, or in defining what hath bene delivered by the Apoſtles. And in
this, <pb n="272" facs="tcp:59214:145"/>Whitaker by rejecting S. Chryſoſtome, whom he
could not otherwiſe anſwer, ſhewes more ſincerity then you doe.</p>
               <p n="204">204. Laſtly: Wheras you ſay, there are no
vniverſall Traditions of the Church for matters of Doctrine, we haue

concerne the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Government of the church; Forme and matter of
Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other Points of which I ſpoke hertofore, even out of Dr.
Field and other Proteſtant learned Writers. And indeed ſeing S.
Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foſtome ſaith, as we haue ſeene, that the Apoſtles delivered many
things without writing, who will belieue without any convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to
the contrary, that not one of thoſe many ſhould be tranſmitted to
poſterity, conſidering how many things are not clearly expreſſed in
Scripture, even the chief heads of Chriſtian Doctrine, as Dr. Field
confeſſes; and I haue demonſtrated that the very Articles of our Creed,
are not cleare without the Declaration of the church, and it appeares in the
experience we haue before our eyes in the contentions of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
concerning thoſe principall Articles of the Creed.</p>
               <p n="205">205. But now let vs returne to anſwer your
aſſertion out of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, which in effect is done to our hands by Dr.
Field, who, (Lib: 4. Cap: 20.) ſummoneth divers Traditions not contayned in
ſcripture, as <hi>the chief heads of Chriſtian Doctrine, and diſtinct
explication of many things, ſomwhat obſcurly contained in Scripture.</hi>
Yea Dr. Potter, though he hold all Fundamentall Points of Faith to be contained
in the Creed, yet (Pag: 216.) he puts this reſtriction, that it muſt be
<hi>taken in a Catholike ſenſe, that is, as it was further opened and
explained in ſome parts (by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of emergent Hereſyes) in the other
Catholique Creeds of Nice, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, Epheſus, Chalcedon, and
Athanaſius.</hi> Now as Hereſyes may ſtill ariſe, ſo ſtill there
will be neceſſity of a new opening, or explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and what would ſuch
explications availe vs in order to an Act of Faith, if the whole church may
erre? And therfor when S. Auſtine is alledged to ſay, that all
neceſſary Points are manifeſt in ſcripture, he cannot be vnderſtood
of ſcripture alone without explication, or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the church, even
for Fundamentall Points, (and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to ſalvation)
contayned in the Creed. This anſwer you might haue gathered out of S.

               </p>
               <p n="209">209. Anſwer: 1. I cited S. Auſtine, Theſe things,

doubt, whether that which ſhe practiſes, did not containe ſome errour
againſt Faith, or deviation from manners; or whether that which you call
order and decency, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, may not containe ſomething againſt
ſcripture: For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether according to the example of our Saviour, the
Euchariſt were not to be celebrated after ſupper, or at the tyme when we
are wont to ſupp, as Proteſtants commonly call it the ſupper; which
certainly you cannot avoyd by ſcripture alone, but only by authority of the
Church, which practiſeth the contrary. And this is ſo great a doubt, that
Januarivs conſulted S. Auſtine about it; and S. Auſtine anſwers, that
we are to follow the cuſtome of Churches: though yet in the ſame Epiſtle,
(Cap. 7.) he ſaith: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Nonnullos probabilis quaedam ratio
&amp;c. Some were moved with a probable reaſon, that vpon one particular day
in the yeare, on which our Lord gaue the ſupper, the Body and Bloud of our

<q rend="margQuotes">If I waſh thee not, thou ſhalt haue

Mark the word ought, which may ſeeme to ſound a comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and was ſpoken
not only to S. Peter, but to all the reſt. Therfor vnless we rely on the
churches practiſe, Declaration, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, we muſt ſay that
there is a command to waſh feete, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we receyve the Euchariſt,
or els abſolutely without relation to that <pb n="275" facs="tcp:59214:146"/>Sacrament,
becauſe our Saviour ſayd abſolutely, you ought to waſh one an others
feet. Morover; How will you aſſure vs, that bread for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of
Conſecration, muſt not of neceſſity be vnleavened; and the wine only of
that kind which our Saviour vſed at that tyme? Or if you may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate in
any kind of wine, why not in any kind of bread? Which are things belonging not

forbidden or commanded in ſcripture, the doing, or omiſſion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were
damnable: therfor S. Auſtine muſt ſuppoſe that the vniverſall church
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre. Neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he be thought to ſay: theſe things are not
vnlawfull, but indifferent, therfor it is madness to diſpute againſt them,
if they be practiſed by the whole church; but contrarily he muſt ſay, the
whole church practiſes them; therfore they are lawfull, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it is madness to
diſpute againſt them; which were not ſo, if the whole church might erre:
neither had he ſayd any more of the vniverſall than of any particular
church, which ought not to be diſturbed for things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: as you ibid:
(Pag. 151. N. 42.) deny not but it might be <hi>eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pride and folly,
to contradict and diſturbe the Church for matter of order, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the
tyme and place and other circomſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of Gods worſhip:</hi> And yet S.
Auſtine in that Epiſtle, (Cap. 2.) having firſt mentioned things
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in ſcripture, adds theſe words: 
<q rend="margQuotes">But thoſe things which we keep not as
written, but by tradition, if they be obſerved through the whole world, are
vnderſtood to be kept as reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended and ordayned either by the Apoſtles

in the Church: and having given examples of things which are differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
obſerved in different places and countryes, ſaith: this kind of things is
freely obſerved: neither is there any better order for a grave and prudent
Chriſtian, then that he doe as he ſees done in that church to which he
chances to come: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d afterward he diſallowes their proceeding, who are
cauſe of diſturbance for things which can be decided neither by the
authority of holy ſcripture, nor by tradition of the vniverſall church.</q>
Therfor according to S. Auſtine, if o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we haue a tradition of the
vniverſall church, we may a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ought to defend it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further diſpute,

aſſured that the vniverſall church cannot approue any vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
practiſe, or deliver any thing againſt faith: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfor he ſaith Cap.
4. <pb n="276" facs="tcp:59214:147"/>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">that he who alledges only the cuſtome
of his particular country, will not ſpeake out of ſcripture, neither will
he take his proofes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the voice of the vniverſall church dilated through
the world:</q> Where we ſee S. Auſtine makes a difference between a
particular and vniverſall church, and conſtantly ioynes togeather the Holy
Scripture, and the voice of the vniverſall church, either of which
whoſoever can alledg, he may confidently ſtand for what they deliver. And
for this cauſe (cap. 5.) he ſaith that Januarius to whom he wrote, was to
conſider whether that of which there was Queſtion, be contayned in
ſcripture, or be vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly practiſed by the whole church, or of the
third kind which is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in divers places and countryes; of which third
kind he ſaith,

that church where he fynds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</q> But of the two firſt kinds he
ſpeakes, as I noted aboue, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, that there is no doubt but
that we are to doe what the Holy Scripture preſcribes, as alſo whatſoever
the vniverſall church doth practiſe, and that to diſpute againſt any
ſuch thing, is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent madness. What could haue bene ſpoken more
cleare? to ſhew that we are not to follow the vniverſall church, becauſe
we judg aforehand that what ſhe practiſes, is lawfull, but becauſe we
learne by her practiſe, that it is lawfull, and ſo ought not to doubt 
<q rend="margQuotes">quin ita faciendum ſit,</q> that is
ought to be ſo done; and ſo we muſt learne of her both the practiſe,
and the lawfulness therof: And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatſoever is againſt
ſcripture, or the practiſe of the vniverſall Church, muſt not be ranked
among the third kind of things, of which he ſayd, 
<q rend="margQuotes">none of thoſe things are againſt
Faith or Manners;</q> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, whatſoever is of the two firſt
kinds, that is, againſt ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the vniverſall Church, muſt be
eſteemed to be of a different nature, and contrary to Faith or Manners; and
therfor, ſaith he,

your ſaying here, that it is not to be accounted <hi>pride or folly, to goe
about to reforme ſome errours which the Church hath ſuffered to come in,
and to vitiate therby the ſubſtance of Gods Worſhip;</hi> is directly
againſt S Auſtine: and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoyd the crime of ſchiſme, by

by this moſt pernicious Doctrine, that the vniverſall Church may erre.</p>
               <p n="210">210. From theſe places of S. Auſtine, and what we
haue ſayd in <pb n="277" facs="tcp:59214:147"/>this whole chapter, it is eaſy to
anſwer a kind of Objection which you make (Pag 134. N. 13.) againſt thoſe
words of <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part. 1. Ch. 3. N. 19.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">I deliver a catalogue, wherin are
compriſed all Points y vs taught to be neceſſary to ſalvation, in
theſe words: We are obliged vnder paine of damnation, to belieue whatſoever
the Catholique viſible church of Chriſt propoſeth as revealed by God.</q>
Againſt this you ſay, that <hi>in reaſon Charity Maintayned might thinke
it enough</hi> for Proteſtants <hi>alſo to ſay in generall, that it is
ſufficient for any mans ſalvation; to believe, that the ſcripture is true
and contaynes all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and to doe his beſt
endeavour to find and belieue the true ſenſe of it, without delivering any
particular catalogue of the fundamentalls of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="211">211. This Objection, I ſay is eaſily anſwered out
of the grounds we haue layed and proved. For, Firſt, we deny that ſcripture
containes all things neceſſary for ſalvation; and ſo one might belieue
all the contents therof, and yet want the belief of ſome neceſſary
Points. But whoſoever believes ſcripture, with the Traditions and
Definitions of Gods Church, is ſure to belieue all; and ſo hath a
ſufficient catalogue of all. 2. Whoſoever believes the church, hath an
evident and certaine Meanes to know the true Meaning of ſcripture, in all
neceſſary Points: Not ſo, they, who belieue only ſcripture which needs
an infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter. 3. We are ſure, that the church which is
aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt, will not faile to propoſe in all
occaſions every particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, as neceſſity ſhall
require: Which, as I haue often ſayd, ſcripture cannot doe, taken alone.
And therfor our chiefeſt care muſt be, to belieue the true church, which we
know will propoſe, in due tyme, all neceſſary Points of Faith, whether or
no we know what Points in particular are fundamentall: and ſo this belief of
the church, brings with it the explicite belief of all neceſſary Objects,
as need ſhall be: But you cannot tell whether you belieue all fundamentall
Points, vnless firſt you know what Points in particular be ſuch, and
therfor Proteſtants hitherto haue endeavoured to aſſigne a particular
Catalogue of them: and after all, you come to tell vs, that it is
impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to make any ſuch Catalogue.</p>
               <p n="212">212. But enough of this Objection, and whole Queſtion,
wherin much more might haue beene ſayd, out of ſcripture, Fathers, and
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; which may be ſeene at large in Catholique VVriters. My purpoſe
was to anſwer <hi>Mr. Chillingworths</hi> Arguments; and yet ſome will
thinke I haue beene to long; to whoſe judgment I would ſubſcribe as
ſoone <pb n="278" facs="tcp:59214:148"/>as any other, if I had not found, that
perpetually he gives ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as I muſt either haue bene long,
or wholy diſſembled them; and by occaſion given by him, ſome things not
vnprofitable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, haue bene declared.</p>
               <p n="213">213. And even now, I muſt not omitt to add a new
Argument to all my former: and it is this; that although it were granted, that
ſcripture alone did containe evidently and expreſly, all particular Truths,
that we are bound to belieue, yet this were not enough for Proteſtants, if
they will belieue this mans doctrine, which is ſuch, as overthrowes the
authority of ſcripture it ſelf; and therfor they muſt either renounce his
Aſſertions, or els be content to alter their pretended moſt common
ground, that ſcripture alone contaynes evidently, and in particular, all
Points of Faith; and ſo returne to belieue the authority, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of Gods Church.</p>
               <p n="214">214. The Reader, I confess, may well expect now, that
having proved Chriſtian Faith to be infallibly true, and that this
infallibility cannot be ſetled vpon ſcripture alone, I ſhould according
to good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, declare what is that, on which it muſt be grounded: yet for
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting this Queſtion about the ſufficiency of ſcripture alone, I
muſt of neceſſity ſhew out of this mans particular Tenets, that if his
doctrine were true, ſcripture cannot be any Rule at all, and much less a
perfect Rule for matters of Faith. This I will endeavour to peforme in the next
Chapter.</p>

revealed to his Apoſtles, and the Apoſtles taught the Churches, are
contayned in Scripture. That is, all the materiall Objects of our Faith; wherof
the Scripture is none, but only the meanes of conveying them vnto vs: Which we
belieue not finally, and for it ſelf, but for the matter contained in it. So
that if men did belieue the doctrine contayned in Scripture, it ſhould no way
hinder their ſalvation, not to know whether there were any Scripture or no.
Thoſe barbarous nations Irenaeus ſpeakes of, were in this caſe, and yet
no doubt but they might be ſaved. The end that God aymes at, is the belief of
the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the Covenant between God and man; the Scripture he hath
provided as a meanes for this end, and this alſo we are to belieue, but not
as the laſt Object of our Faith, but as the inſtrument of it. When therfor

you teach, as you doe, that one is not bound to belieue Scripture, but may
reject it, you muſt grant, that by the ſame reaſon he may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue,
yea, may reject Chriſt himſelf. And now heare what you ſay; (Pag: 116. N.
159.) <hi>If a man ſhould belieue Chiſtian Religion wholly and entirely,
and liue according to it, ſuch a man, though he ſhould not know or not
belieue the Scripture to be a Rule of Faith, no nor to be the word of God, my
opinyon is, he may be ſaved; and my reaſon is, becauſe he performes the
entire condition of the new Covenant, which is, that we belieue the matter of
the Goſpell, and not that it is contained in theſe or theſe Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. So
that the Bookes of Scripture are not ſo much the Objects of our Faith, as the
inſtruments of conveying it to our vnderſtanding; and not ſo much of the
being of the Chriſtian Doctrine, as requiſite to the well being of it.
Irenaeus tells vs of ſome barbarous Nations; that believed the Doctrine of
Chriſt, and yet believed not the Scripture to be the word of God, for they
never heard of it, and Faith comes by hearing: But theſe barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
might be ſaved: Therfor men might be ſaved without believing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be the word of God; much more without believing it to be a Rule, and a
perfect Rule of Faith. Neither doubt I but if the Bookes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had
beene propoſed to them by the other parts of the Church, where they had bene
before receyved, and had bene doubted of or even rejected by thoſe barbarous
Nations, but ſtill by the bare belief and practiſe of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, they
might be ſaved: God requiring of vs vnder paine of damnation, only to belieue
the verityes therin contayned, and not the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Bookes
wherin they are contayned.</hi> In ſome of theſe words, you may perhaps
ſeeme to ſpeake ambiguouſly, <hi>That the Scriptures are not ſo much
the Objects of our Faith, as the inſtruments of conveying it to our
vnderſting.</hi> For, <hi>(not ſo much)</hi> ſeemes to ſignify, that
they are the objects of our Faith in ſome degree: but this very mincing of
things, ſhewes the abſurdity of that wherin you are afrayd to declare your

muſt ſay, that you hold ſcripture not to be a materiall Object of our
Faith which muſt conſiſt in indiviſibili. For, if this truth
(ſcripture is the word of God) be revealed, it is no leſſe abſolutely
and rigorouſly a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall object of Faith, then the verityes contayned in

by your next N. 160 Pag. 117.) Where you ſay; <hi>This diſcourſe whether
it be rationall and concluding or no, I ſubmitt to better judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
For you ſpeake of the diſcourſe which I haue now ſett downe out of your
(N. 159.) Neither can you avoide this abſurdity, by ſaying; one may reject
ſcripture, if it be not ſufficiently propounded. For, you put the very
caſe, that it ſhould be propoſed by the other parts of the church, where
they had bene before receyved: As alſo you expreſſly put a difference
between the verityes contained in ſcripture a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſcripture which contaynes
them, ſaying; <hi>God requires of vs vnderpayne of damnation, only to belieue
the verityes therin contained, and not the divine Authority of the bookes
wherin they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned;</hi> and yet it is a thing granted by all, and
evident of it ſelf, that none ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be obliged to belieue the verityes
contayned in ſcripture, or any other verityes, vnless they be ſufficiently
propoſed: and therfor if you will make good, the difference you put between
ſcripture and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents therof, and not contradict yourſelf, you muſt
confess, that one is not obliged to belieue ſcripture or the divine Authority
therof, but may reject it, although it be ſufficiently propoſed: yea it
will alſo follow, that the contents therof may be rejected, the firſt, and
laſt, and totall knowledge wherof Proteſtants pretend to receyue only from
the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word. For, they cannot poſſibly conceaue any obligation to
belieue the contents of ſcripture, if firſt they be perſwaded, that they
haue no obligation to belieue ſcripture it ſelf, from which alone they can
come to know any ſuch obligation. And ſo proteſtant miniſters in
England, ſubſcribing to the 6, of their 39 Articles (That <hi>ſcripture
containeth all things neceſſary to ſalvation</hi>) in effect
ſubſcribe to nothing, but may reject all thoſe Articles whenſoever they
pleaſe. But of the abſurdity of this your doctrine herafter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For the preſent, I muſt obſerue ſome things
delivered by you in the places which I haue cited. Firſt, (Pag. 66. N. 33.)
where you teach, that ſcripture is an inſtrumentall Object of our Faith:
which is a ſtrang kind of ſpeach. Philoſophers tell vs of a materiall,
and formall Object, of a totall, and Partiall, of an Adequate, and Inadequate,
and ſome <pb n="283" facs="tcp:59214:150"/>other Diviſions of Objects; but of an
inſtrumentall Object I never heard. Nothing can be ſtiled an Object of any
act of our vnderſtanding, vnless it be apprehended by that act; and nothing
conſequently can be called the Object of an Act of Faith, vnless it be
believed by an act of Faith; and if it be believed by an act of Faith, as a
thing revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it is a materiall Object of Faith, and ſo your phraſe of
an inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Object, ſerves only to confute your owne doctrine, and
proue that ſcripture is a materiall Object of Faith. Beſides, who ever
dreamed, that either the divine Revelation, which is the formall Object of
Faith, or the things revealed, which are the Materiall Objects therof, can be
called according to Philoſophy, the Inſtruments of an act of Faith? Or who
ever heard that an Inſtrument is divided into a Formall and Materiall
Inſtrument?</p>
               <p n="6">6. 2. You ſay in the ſame place <hi>All the divine
Verityes which Chriſt revealed to the Apoſtles, and the Apoſtles taught
the Churches are contained in ſcripture.</hi> Againſt which words I haue
theſe juſt exceptions: That they are againſt yourſelf, who
expreſſly teach that the Apoſtles declared diverſe things to the Church
of their tyme, which declarations are not extant: as alſo that they are
againſt this doctrine of yours, that ſcripture is not a materiall object of
Faith. For I aske, whether, or no, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles taught the Churches, that
the Bookes or Epiſtles, or Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes, written by Canonicall Authors, were
the word of God? If they did; then the divine authority of ſcripture is a
materiall object of our Faith, as being a thing taught by the Apoſtles with
divine infallible aſſiſtance: which is the reaſon why we belieue, that
other myſteryes delivered by them, are to be believed by an Act of Faith. If
the Apoſtles did not teach the Churches this Truth; by what authority do you
now belieue it to be the word of God? Yourſelf, ſpeaking of the
Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>onicalness of ſome ſcriptures, ſay, (142. N. 28.) <hi>If it were not
revealed by God to the Apoſtles, and by the Apoſtles to the Church, then
can it be no Revelation:</hi> as on the other ſide, you teach in the ſame
place, that if the Apoſtles delivered it, it was to be believed as an article
of Faith?</p>
               <p n="7">7. 3. In your (Pag: 217. and 218. N. 49.) which I cited
aboue, you ſay, <hi>Is it not manifest to all the world, that Christians of
all Profeſſions do agree with one conſent, in the belief of all thoſe
Bookes of ſcripture, which were not doubted of in the Ancient Church, without
danger of damnation?</hi> And how then ſay you (Pag. 116. N. 159.) that men
might reject the ſcripture; <hi>God requiring of vs vnder payne of damnation,
only to belieue the verityes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, and not the Divine Authority of
the Books wherin they are <pb n="284" facs="tcp:59214:151"/>con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

belieue, that not to be damnable, which yourſelf acknowledg Chriſtians of
all Profeſſions to agree with one conſent to haue bene damnable, namely,
not to belieue all thoſe Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes which were not doubted of in the ancient
Church? Or how are not thoſe bookes an Object of our Faith, and belief, in
the <hi>Belief wherof, Chriſtians of all profeſſions agree with one
conſent?</hi> Or how can you ſay in the ſame (Pag. 218. N. 49.) <hi>Is it
not apparent, that no man at this tyme, can without hypocriſy, pretend to
belieue in Chriſt, but of necesſity he muſt do ſo?</hi> That is he
muſt belieue all thoſe Bookes of Scripture, which were not doubted of in
the Church, <hi>ſeing he can haue no reaſon to belieue in Chriſt, but he
muſt haue the ſame to belieue the ſcripture.</hi> And Pag. 116. N. 159.)
you ſay; <hi>It were now very ſtrange and vnreaſonable, if a man ſhould
belieue the matter of the Bookes,</hi> (of Scripture) <hi>and not the Authority
of the Bookes: and therfor if a man ſhould profess the not believing of
theſe, I ſhould hane reaſon to feare he did not believe that:</hi> How, I
ſay, can you write in this manner, who teach, that ſcripture is not a
materiall object of faith, which we are bound to belieue vnder payne of
damnation, and yet that we are bound to belieue the verityes contained therin,
of which, Chriſt is one? Is there the ſame reaſon to belieue a thing
revealed, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d another acknowledged not to be revealed? I hope your meaning is
not that it is reaſonable, not to belieue the authority of ſcripture, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
yet that it is reſonable, for the authority therof to belieue the matter of
it: which were not only vnreaſonable, but impoſſible alſo; as no man
can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſſent to a Concluſion in vertue of Premiſes which he
believes not to be true.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But in this laſt place (Pag: 116. N. 159.) you haue a
ſubtilty expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>There is not alwayes an equall
neceſſity of the belief of thoſe things, for the belief wherof there is
an equall reaſon. We haue I belieue, as great reaſon to belieue there was
ſuch a man as Henry the eigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> King of England, as that Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered vnder Pontius
Pilate: yet this is neceſſary to be believed, and that is not ſo. So that
if any man ſhould doubt or diſbelieue that, it were moſt vnreaſonably
done of him, yet it were no mortall ſin, nor no ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ne at all: God having no where commanded men
vnder payne of damnation to believe all which Reaſon induceth them to
belieue. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for as an Executor, that ſhould performe the will of the dead,
ſhould fully ſatisfy the law, though he did not belieuo that parchment to
be his Written will, which indeed is ſo: ſo I belieue, that he who believes
all the particular doctrines which integrate Chriſtianity, and lives
according, to them, ſhould be <pb n="285" facs="tcp:59214:151"/>ſaved, though he
neither believed, nor knew that the Goſpell were written by the
Evangeliſts, or the Epiſtles by the Apoſtles.</hi> This is your
diſcourſe; which deſerves deteſtation rather then confutation. Yet I
muſt not omitt to make ſome reflexions on it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Firſt then: wheras you ſay, <hi>There is not
alwayes an equall necesſity for the belief of thoſe things, for the belief
wherof there is an equall reaſon:</hi> I anſwer, that you ſpeake very
confuſedly, and imperfectly; and either vntruly, if your words be ſo
vnderſtood, as they may make any thing to our preſent Queſtion: or
impertinently, if they belong nothing to it. I ſay therfor: if the belief of
one thing, be neceſſary for the belief of another, which I am bound to
belieue, the belief of both is neceſſary: the one, for it ſelfe, the
other for that other, which is ſuppoſed to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary of it ſelf,
as you ſay the belief of ſcripture is only for the belief of the contents.
Secondly; if the reaſon for which I belieue a thing, be not only true, but
alſo by the nature therof neceſſarily obliges me to belieue that thing
which it proves; in that event, wherſoever I find that reaſon, I ſhall
remaine obliged to belieue that Object which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves. This is our caſe.
For, no Chriſtian, yea no man indued with reaſon, can deny, but that if I
belieue an Object, as teſtifyed by God, I am o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to belieue all other
Truths ſo teſtifyed. Now I pray you tell vs the reaſon for which at this
tyme you hold yourſelf obliged to belieue the contents of ſcripture. You
muſt anſwer: becauſe they are revealed by God teſtifying the truth of
them by many and great miracles. Then I aske, for what reaſon do you belieue
Scripture to be the word of God? If you anſwer, becauſe God hath
teſtifyed it to be ſuch, by thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which the Apoſtles wrought
to proue their words and writings to be infallible and inſpired by the Holy
Ghoſt: then I inferr, that as you are bound to belieue the contents of
Scripture, ſo you are alſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to belieue Scripture it ſelf; ſeing
you haue the ſame reaſon to belieue that God hath teſtifyed both the
Scripture, and the contents therof. If you belieue Scripture to be the word of
God, not for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Teſtimony, for which you belieue the contents, but
for ſome other Reaſon; then your ſaying <hi>(There is not alwayes an
equall necesſity for the belief of thoſe things, for the belief wherof
there is an equall Reaſon)</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, becauſe for the belief of
Scripture there is not the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for which you belieue the verityes
therin contained and your other ſaying (Pag. 218. N. 49) muſt be
<hi>falſe</hi> (that no man at this tyme <hi>can haue reaſon to belieue in
Chriſt, but he muſt haue the ſame to belieue the <pb n="286" facs="tcp:59214:152"/>Scripture,</hi>) if it be true that you belieue not ſcripture for
the ſame reaſon for which you belieue Chriſt, and other myſteryes
contained in it. But let vs know indeed, for what reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you belieue
Scripture to be the word of God. It ſeemes, one may anſwer for you out of
your Anſwer to your Third Motiue, where you teach, that the <hi>Bible hath
bene confirmed with thoſe ſupernaturall and Divine Miracles, which were
wrought by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, and the Apoſtles;</hi> And (Pag. 379. N.
69.) you ſay, <hi>following the Scripture I ſhall belieue that which
vniverſall never-failing Tradition aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures me, that it was by the
admirable ſupernaturall worke of God, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be the word of God.</hi>
If this be true; how are not men obliged to belieue that which hath bene ſo
confirmed? Or for what other reaſon do you belieue the Truths contayned in
Scripture; as our Saviour; His Incarnation; Life; Death; Reſurrection, and
other Myſteryes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, but becauſe they were confirmed by
the admirable ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall workes of God, wherby you expreſſly grant
Scripture to haue bene confirmed to be the word of God? You muſt therfor
either grant, that there is a neceſſity to belieue Scripture to be the word
of God, or deny that there is a neceſſity to belieue the contents therof.
And then further, for our preſent Queſtion; you muſt either grant, that
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a materiall Object of Faith, or deny that the verityes therin
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, are ſuch an Object; vnless you will confess yourſelf to be a
very ſtrang and vnreaſonable man, to belieue the matter of the bookes, (of
Scripture) and not the Authority of the bookes; and therfor ſince you profess
not to be obliged to belieue, theſe, may not one haue reaſon (to vſe your
owne words) to feare, that you do not thinke yourſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to belieue,
that? Nay, is it not apparent (ſtill I vſe your owne words) that you at
this tyme cannot without hypocriſy, pretend an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to belieue in
Chriſt, but of neceſſity you muſt acknowledg an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to belieue
the Bookes of ſcripture; ſeing you can haue no reaſon to thinke you are
obliged to belieue in Chriſt, but muſt haue the ſame to belieue the
ſcripture: and if your belief of the contents of ſcripture, or of
obligation to belieue them, be vnreaſonable, it cannot proceed from the
particular motion of the Holy Ghoſt, nor be an Act of divine Faith. And I
beſeech you reflect, that here there is not only the ſame reaſon for the
truth of things in themſelves, but alſo for our obligation to belieue them,
namely, the divine Teſtimony: which Point if you obſerue, you cannot but
ſee, how impertinent your example was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout believing there was ſuch a man
as King Henry, (which you ſay, <pb n="287" facs="tcp:59214:152"/>one is not bound to
belieue) <hi>and that Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered vnder Pontius Pilate,</hi>
which is a Truth ſet downe in a writing confirmed by Miracles to be the word
of God, and conſequently to deny the Myſteryes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that booke,
were to reject a thing confeſſed to be witneſſed by God. And is not a
man obliged to belieue whatſoever he knowes to be witneſſed by God? I
ſayd, your example is impertinent; but I muſt add, that it is alſo
falſe, vnchriſtian, and blaſphemous, to ſay, as you doe, <hi>We haue I
belieue as great reaſon to belieue there was ſuch a man as Henry the eight,
King of England, as that Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered vnder Pontius
Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi> Haue you as great reaſon to belieue the Chronicles of England,
and the Teſtimony of men, as to belieue the word of God?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Morover though it import nothing to our preſent
Queſtion, whether or no you ſpeake true, in ſaying; <hi>there is not
alwayes an equall neceſſity for the belief of thoſe things, for the
belief wherof there is an equall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> yet perhaps you will not
eaſily make it good, if there be perfectly and entirely the ſame reaſon,
and of the ſame kind, for both of them. For if I conceaue the ſame reaſon
for both, if I belieue the one I may belieue the other; nay, I haue a
neceſſity to belieue it, ſo far, as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belieue the contrary; as it
is impoſſible from the ſame premiſes, belieued to be the ſame, to
inferr contrary or contradictory conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. If perhaps you anſwer, that
when one believes a thing for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which he ſees to be the ſelf
ſame for another, he cannot diſſent from that other, yet he may
ſuſpend his vnderſtanding, from any poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue aſſent to it; which
he cannot doe when there is a command to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue it: This anſwer will not
ſerue your turne; but firſt, it is againſt your ſelf, who (Pag. 195. N.
11.) ſay to <hi>Cha: Ma: your diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Points neceſſary to
be believed, and neceſſary not to be diſbelieved, is a diſtinction
without a difference, there being no point to any man, at any tyme, in any
circumſtances neceſſary not to be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſbelieved but it is to the ſame man, at the
ſame tyme, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſame
circumſtances, neceſſary to be belieyed.</hi> Out of which words it
followeth, that ſeing, one can at no tyme disbelieue, or diſſent from
that for which he hath the ſame reaſon, in vertue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he belieues
another thing, he muſt neceſſarily belieue it, according to your
doctrine. Secondly: If we belieue a thing meerly for ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or naturall
Reaſon, you will not, I belieue, be able to ſhew that we are obliged to
belieue any one thing, and are not obliged to belieue another, for which we
haue the ſame reaſon. For, if the command be only this; that reaſon
obliges vs to belieue that which in reaſon deſerves <pb n="288" facs="tcp:59214:153"/>belief the reaſons being equall, the neceſſity of believing
muſt be equall. But if the command of believing be ſupernaturall, or ſome
Poſitiue Divine Precept, then this muſt be notifyed to vs by revelation,
and ſo there will not be the ſame reaſon for both, but as different as is
between humane reaſon and divine revelation; and therfore, Thirdly; If I haue
the ſame reaſon of divine revelation to belieue both, there is <hi>alwayes
an equall neceſſity for the belief of thoſe things, for the belief wherof
there is</hi> that equall reaſon of divine reuelation: and ſo your
ſubtilty, That there is not alwayes an <hi>equall neceſſity for the
belief of thoſe things, for the belief wherof</hi> &amp;c: is againſt
reaſon, againſt yourſelf, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d againſt all divinity.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I haue no tyme to looſe in examining your ſaying:
<hi>If any man ſhould doubt or disbelieue, that there was ſuch a man as
Henry the eight, king of England, it were moſt vnreaſonably done of him,
yet it were no mortall ſin, nor ſin at all; God having no where commanded
men vnderpayne of damnation to belieue all which reaſon induceth them to
belieue.</hi> Yet perhaps ſome wold as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, whether you ſuppoſe, that he
who in the example you giue, ſo doubts or disbelieves, doth it vincibly, or
invincibly? If invincibly; then in him it is not vnreaſonable: becauſe he,
in ſuch circumſtances could judg no otherwiſe, and ſo in him it is
reaſonable. For, it falls out often, that a true judgment may be imprudent,
and vnreaſonable, if it be framed lightly, and for inſufficient reaſons;
and contrarily, one may judge amiſſe for the materiall truth in it ſelf,
and yet judg prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he be moved by probable reaſons; and ſo a true
judgment may be raſh, and a falſe one prudent. But if he who ſo doubts,
be ſuppoſed to erre vincibly; you will not eaſily excuſe him from all
fault: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, of pertinacy, and obſtinacy of judgment againſt all
wiſe men; or precipitation; or imprudency, or at leaſt from an idle thought
in his extravagant, vnreaſonable, falſe, and fooliſh belief, which
ſurely can be of no ſolid profit for himſelf or others, or for the glory
of God: and you know, our B. Saviour hath revealed, that every idle word is a
ſin. But whatſoever be ſayd of your Doctrine taken in generall, that God
hath no where commanded men to belieue all which reaſon induceth them to
belieue; yet I leaue it to be conſidered, whethert he particular example
which you giue may not ſeeme in it ſelf to imply ſomthing of the
dangerous; for if it be no ſin at all, to belieue that there was never any
ſuch man as Henry the eight, (and I ſuppoſe you will ſay the ſame of
other like examples, of Kings, Princes, Commonwealths, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats)
ſome perhaps will infer, That if your Doctrine were true, it 
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59214:153"/>could be no ſin at all to belieue that they had no
lawfull Succeſſours, ſeing no body can ſucceed to a Chimera, or to a
No-Body, or a Non-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, as you ſay King Henry may be without ſin
believed to haue bene.</p>
               <p n="12">12, But at leaſt your frends will thinke you haue
ſpoken ſubtilly, and to the purpoſe in your other reaſon, or example:
<hi>That as an Executor that ſhould performe the whole will of the dead,
ſhould fully ſatiſfy the law, though he did not belieue that Parchment to
be his written will, which indeed is ſo: So I belieue, that he who believes
all the particular doctrines which integrate Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d lives
according to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould be ſaved, though he neither believed nor knew
that the Goſpels were written by the Evangeliſts, nor the Epiſtles by the
Apoſtles,</hi> Yet in this alſo, you either erre againſt truth, or
overthrow your owne maine cauſe. For, if ſuch an Executor <hi>did not
belieue that Parchment to be the dead mans written will,</hi> and had no other
ſufficient ground to belieue the contents to be his will, he ſhould neither
ſatiſfy the law, (which gives him no power, but in vertue of the dead mans
will) nor his owne conſcience, but ſhould vſurpe the office without any
Authority, and expoſe himſelf to danger of committing great injuſtice by
diſpoſing the goods of the dead againſt his meaning, and depriving of
their right thoſe, to whom, for ought he knowes, they were bequeathed by the
true will of the party deceaſed. Now apply this your caſe to our preſent
Queſtion, and the reſult will be; that ſeing according to Proteſtants,
de facto we know the contents of Scripture, and the Will and Commands of God
delivered therin, only by Scripture it ſelfe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by no other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of
Tradition or declaration of the Church; if one be not obliged to belieue the
Scripture, he cannot be obliged to belieue all, or any of the <hi>particular
doctrines which integrate Chriſtianity,</hi> nor can judge himſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>to liue according to them;</hi> nor can any man without injury depriue men
of the liberty which they poſſess, by impoſing vpon their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
ſuch an obligation.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And here I muſt not omitt your ſaying; that a man
<hi>may be ſaued, though he ſhould not know or not bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

to be the word of God:</hi> Where you diſtinguiſh between being a Rule of

rather is our Religion, and the ſole, and adequate object of our Faith.</hi>
If ſcripture be the <hi>ſole and adequate object of Faith,</hi> certainly
it is an object of Faith or a thing believed by Faith. How then do you teach,
that it is not an object of Faith? Beſides, into what <pb n="291" facs="tcp:59214:154"/>extremes do you fall, teaching on the one ſyde, that ſcripture is

thus, as ſomtyme you teach, that not ſcripture it ſelf, but only the

the contents, but only ſcripture it ſelf is the object thereof; becauſe
having begun to ſay, that ſcripture containeth the objects of Faith; by way

can I belieue, a thing, becauſe ſuch a man affirmes it, vnless I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue,
both that he affirmes it, and that his word deſerves credit? But
Proteſtants belieue the contents of ſcripture for the Authority of

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for it is not ſufficient to belieue the Matters contayned in

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for if we belieue the Myſteryes of Chriſtian Faith, for ſcripture,
we muſt beliue ſcripture itſelf to be of infallible Authority: And
Proteſtants in particular can haue no Faith at all, who pretend to belieue
all the Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teryes of our Faith for the Authority of ſcripture alone, if
ſcriptur be not believed to be infallible.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Fourtly. I take an Argument from your reaſon to the
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For thoſe people of whom S. Irenaeus ſpeakes, had not bene
obliged to belieue the Myſteryes of Chriſtian Faith, vnless they had bene
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d made credible by Arguments, which proved them to proceed from
God: but you gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the ſcripture is proved to proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, by
thoſe very Miracles which were wrought by Chriſt a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his Apoſtles:
therfor if theſe people were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obliged to belieue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of
ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s now are for the ſame reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obliged to belieue
ſcripture it ſelf</p>
               <p n="19">19. Fiftly. Not vnlike to this Reaſon is that which I
tooke from your owne words; (Pag: 115. N. 156.) where you teach, that
<hi>nothing can chalenge our belief, but what hath deſcended to vs by
originall and vniverſall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:</hi> and that ſcripture alone is
ſuch: therfor ſcripture doth chaleng our belief, and is an object of
Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p n="20">20 From theſe two laſt Arguments, I deduce, that this
Truth, (Sctipture is the word of God) is an object to be believed by Faith,
though we ſhould ſuppoſe, that it were propoſed to one, whom God 
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59214:155"/>would not oblige to know the particular Myſteryes
contained therin: becauſe independently of any ſuch obligation, it is
ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly propoſed as a thing revealed by God, and conſequently as an
Article of Faith, abſtracting from any relation to a further end. Which
conſideration o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowes the ground of your aſſertion, that the belief
of ſcripture is referred to the end of believing the contents of it, and
therfore itſelf is not an object of Faith.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Sixtly. If we be not obliged to belieue the
ſcripture, Proteſtants are not bound to belieue the contents therof, as I
haue often ſayd vpon ſeverall occaſions; becauſe they haue no notice of
the contents, but by ſcripture it ſelf. Neither can you anſwer, that we
are obliged to belieue ſcripture as a meanes to lead vs to the verityes
contayned in it. For, this anſwer ſuppoſes, that I haue ſome notice and
belief of being obliged to belieue the matter of ſcripture, before I belieue
the ſcripture; wheras Proteſtants muſt ſay the direct contrary, to wit,
that all their belief or any apprehenſion of the particular Truth of
ſcripture proceeds, from, and is grounded, in ſcripture, which therfor
muſt be believed before, we can be obliged to the belief of thoſe
particular Truths. So that if we haue no antecedent obligation to belieue
ſcripture; we cannot poſſibly, in the grounds of Proteſtants, be
obliged to belieue, the contents therof. Beſides, this Anſwer overthrowes
your owne Aſſertion, and grants that we are obliged to belieue the
ſcripture, at leaſt as a meanes de facto neceſſary to attayne the
belief of the contents therof; it being cleare, that if I be obliged to attayne
an End, I am neceſſarily obliged to vſe the Meanes which is neceſſary
to attaine that End, and conſequently this Anſwer doth not excuſe you,
but ſtrongly proves that you haue a ſtrict obligation to belieue
ſcripture, ſince you are obliged to compaſſe that End of the belief of
thoſe Divine Truths which it containes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is our Queſtion, whether
ſcripture be a materiall Object believed for itſelf alone, as I ſayd
aboue, but whether it be an Object, which I am obliged to belieue; which this
very Anſwer is forced to grant. This diſcourſe is clearly confirmed by
your words (Pag. 86. N. 93.) <hi>It was neceſſary that God by his
Providence ſhould preſerve the ſcripture from any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcernable
corruption in thoſe things which he would haue knowen; otherwiſe it is
apparent it had not bene his will that theſe things ſhould be knowen, the
only meanes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing the knowledg of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, heing periſhed.</hi> Much
more you muſt ſay; it is <hi>appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it had not bene Gods will</hi> that
the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of ſcripture ſhould be knowne, if we need not knowe, yea if we
may reject the only mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <pb n="294" facs="tcp:59214:156"/>of begetting <hi>or
continuing the knowledg of them,</hi> which you in this very particular
acknowledg to be ſcripture, and thence you inferr that God could not but
<hi>preſerue it from any vndiſcernable corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. Seventhly. They who believed theſe Articles of
Chriſtian Faith, becauſe the Apoſtles and Apoſtolicall men did preach
them, believed not only the Myſteryes or Matters which they preached, but
alſo the Authority of thoſe Preachers, as of perſons worthy of credit,
ſo that it was a materiall object of Faith, that the Apoſtles ſpoke in
the name of God, and inſpired by him; yea the matters propoſed were
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved for the Authority of the propoſers, which therfor muſt be
belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at leaſt as much as the things believed: yourſelf ſaying (Pag:
377. N. 59.) <hi>VVe muſt be ſurer of the proofe, then of the thing proved,
otherwiſe it is no proof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> Therfor as their words, ſo their writings muſt be
believed as an object of faith, at leaſt as much as the truths which they
ſpoke or wrote, neither doth ſpeaking or writing make any difference at all
in this point. And as you ſay their writings were referred to the belief of
the things which they wrote, or were taken as Meanes for that End, ſo their
ſpeaking, or preaching was ordained to beget a belief of the things which
they ſpoke; and ſo there is a moſt exact parity; neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you exclude
the authority of ſcripture from being a materiall Object of Faith, but you
muſt likewiſe ſay, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were not bound to belieue the Authority of
the Apoſtles when they preached; and conſequently that they were not
obliged to belieue the Truths which they preached, and which they could belieue
only in vertue of the belief of ſuch an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And further: although it
were ſuppoſed, that ſome one or more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Articles of
Chriſtian Faith, by an extraordinary Motion and light of the Holy Ghoſt,
without the Preaching or writing of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and lived according to
their belief and were ſaved: In that caſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe men could not
be obliged to belieue the preaching or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Apoſtles preciſely
as a meanes for attaining the belief of thoſe Articles, which they believed
already; yet they would remayne obliged to belieue the authority of the
Apoſtles, if at any tyme it came to be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly propounded, and proved
by miracles, or other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of credibility, and could no more reject it,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they could disbelieue the articles of Chriſtian Faith ſufficiently
propoſed: Therfor the authority of the Apoſtles, and the infallibility of
their preaching a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d writing, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to terminate an act of faith,
that is, to be a materiall object therof even of it ſelf, or take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone,
becauſe ſo taken, it may be proved to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God, which is the
formall motiue for which we belieue all <pb n="295" facs="tcp:59214:156"/>the materiall
object of faith. Since therfor you teach, as I haue often put you in mynd, that
ſcripture had bene confirmed by Miracles, you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny it to be a
materiall object of Faith. And this argument is ſtronger againſt you, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the caſe I put, doth declare; wherin it was ſuppoſed, that the articles
of our faith were knowne by ſome other meanes, then by the preaching or
writing of the Apoſtles; wheras de facto you profess to know thoſe articles
only by ſcripture; which therfor you are obliged to belieue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a double
title or account, that is, both as it is credible in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by divine
argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, abſtracting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any further end; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d alſo as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes to
attaine the ſayd end of believing the articles therin contayned.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Eightly. You confess, that we are obliged to belieue
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents or verityes contained in ſcripture: but one of thoſe is, that
ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf is the word of God, and inſpired by Him; therfor we
are obliged to belieue ſcripture to be the word of God. The minor is proved
out of (S. Paul 2. Timoth: 3.16.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">All ſcripture divinely inſpired, is
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to teach, &amp;c. that the man of God may be perfect, inſtructed
to every good worke.</q> Which words, Proteſtants and yourſelf in part,
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to proue, that ſcripture is a perfect and totall Rule of Faith. And
if it be a perfect Rule, certainly it muſt be a Rule; therfor that
ſcripture is a Rule of Faith, is a truth contayned in ſcripture, and
conſequently a materiall Object of our Faith. Or if you will needs ſay,
that we do not belieue as an Object of Faith, ſcripture to be a totall Rule
of faith, you overthrow the cauſe of Proteſtants, and yourſelf, by
confeſſing, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved out of ſcripture, that ſcripture is
ſuch a totall Rule, which is the thing I haue mainly vrged againſt you in

by alledging texts of ſcripture for that purpoſe? Or out of what ground can
you poſſibly pretend to proue, that ſcripture alone is the Rule of Faith
if you gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it cannot be proved out of ſcripture, on which you profess all

that the decrees of the Church are infallible; ſeing then ſcripture ſaith
that itſelf is divinely inſpired, you muſt belieue as a matter of faith,
that it is infallible, or the word of God. The like argument I take from the
doctrine of Proteſtants, and their endeavour to proue out of ſcripture,
that it is a Rule evident for all neceſſary Points, for which they are wont
to alledg the words of the (Pſalme 18. V. 9.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">The precept of <pb n="296" facs="tcp:59214:157"/>our Lord lightſome; illuminating the eyes, and (Pſalm: 118. V.

according to them; this Propoſition, ſcripture is an evident Rule for all

cannot be proved out of ſcripture that it is an evident Rule for ſuch
Poynts. Beſides, (Pag: 143. N. 30.) you bring the ſaid words of S. Paul,
All ſcripture is divinely inſpired, expreſly and immediately to proue,
that the Apoſtles were infallible in their writings: Therfor it is a truth
contayned in ſcripture, and conſequently by your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, a
materiall Object of Faith. Morover, we read (2. Pet. 1.20.21) 
<q rend="margQuotes">vnderſtanding this firſt, that no
prophecy of ſcripture is made by private interpretation. For not by mans will
was propheſy brought at any tyme: but the Holy men of God ſpake, inſpired

contayned in ſcripture, that the writers therof ſpoke and wrote inſpired
by God. And what is oftner repeated in the Prophets, then, the word of our Lord
was made to me, or the like? Therfor one truth contained in ſcripture is,
that they wrote by divine inſpiration. Doth not S. John begin his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps
with theſe words: 
<q rend="margQuotes">The Apocalyps of Jeſus Chriſt,
which God gaue him, &amp;c: bleſſed is he that readeth and heareth the

God gaue him, or inſpired into his mynd: and ſo it is contained in
ſcripture, and a materiall Object of our Faith, and his Apocalyps is the word
of God; Which Truth being declared by S. John, men are bound to belieue it as a
matter of Faith, though they were ſuppoſed to know all the contents of the
Apocalyps by other meanes, for example, by immediate Revelation or
Inſpiration, as S. John himſelf came to know them; vnless you will ſay,
that men may reject what an Apoſtle hath ſet downe in writing. Doth not S.
Peter alſo (2. Epiſt: Cap. 3.15.16.) teach, that S. Paul wrote his
Epiſtles by wiſdom and inſpiration from God? Therfor it is a materiall
object of Faith, that S. Paules E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles are the word of God, even although
one were not bound to know the particular contents of them, or had knowne them
by ſome other meanes: Therfor your Doctrine, that it is ſufficient for

               <p n="24">24. Ninthly and laſtly; in ſtead of an argument, I
may express a juſt admiration, how ſuch a Doctrine as this could appeare in
a Book prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in England, and approved as agreeable to the Doctrine and
Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church of England! Fulke a chief man amongſt Engliſh
Proteſtants, ſaith plainly (in his Confutation of Purgatory, Pag. 214.)
<hi>Whoſoever denyeth the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, therby be wrayeth
himſelf to be an heretike:</hi> And hitherto all Engliſh, and other
Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, haue pretended to oppoſe themſelves againſt the
Swenckfeldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who rejected all the Scripture, as you ſay one may doe, and
yet be ſaved. And certainly if men be not obliged to belieue Scripture as a
matter of Faith, it imports nothing, whether they accept, or reject it: if
alſo they do not belieue it to be the word of God, what certaine cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit can
they giue to it? and if Chriſtians did not belieue it to be ſuch, they
would account it very great fooliſhneſſe, to belieue Myſteryes, which
ſeeme repugnant to all Philoſophy and naturall Reaſon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue men
of thoſe things, to which nature is moſt inclined, vpon any Teſtimony or
Authority, less then Divine. And this your Doctrine is less tolerable,
becauſe you are not able to bring in favour therof, any one argument
deſerving anſwer.</p>
               <p n="25">25. You ſay indeed (Pag: 116. N. 159.) that without
knowing or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſcripture, one may performe the <hi>entire condition of
the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is, that we belieue the matter of the Goſpel, and
not that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in theſe or theſe Bookes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26. But this is a plaine begging the Queſtion, to
ſuppoſe or affirme without proofe, that one condition of the new Covenant
is not, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue ſcripture to be the word of God. Yourſelf (Pag: 134. N.
13.) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly teach, that among the conditions which Chriſt requires,
<hi>one is, that we belieue what he has revealed,</hi> when it is
ſufficiently declared <hi>to hane beene revealed by him.</hi> Now that
ſcripture hath bene revealed by God, is proved with the many Miracles which
the Apoſtles wrought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that they were meſſengers of God, and
Infallible in all matters, which they delivered by word or writing, and therfor
cannot without damnation be rejected by any to whom it is ſufficiently
propounded for ſuch; which ſufficiency of propoſition, is required in all
articles of Faith, fundamentall, or not fundamentall, before one can be obliged
to belieue them.</p>
               <p n="27">27, Since then according to your Doctrine, we are not
obliged to belieue Scripture to be the word of God, yea and may reject it: It
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines <pb n="298" facs="tcp:59214:158"/>true, then, as I ſayd in the laſt Chapter,
Scripture cannot be a perfect Rule, nor any Rule at all of Faith, although we
ſhould falſly ſuppoſe, that it containes evidently all things
neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For, what can it availe me in order to the
exerciſing an act of Faith, to read any Point in that Booke, which I conceiue
my ſelf not obliged to belieue? Let vs now come to another errour of
yours.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Your ſecond errour I find (Pag. 144. N. 31.) where
you write thus. <hi>If you be ſo infallible as the Apoſtles were, ſhew it
as the Apoſtles did; They went forth (ſaith S. Marke) and preached every
where, the lord working with them, and confirming their words with ſignes
following. It is impoſſible that God ſhould lye, and that the eternall
Truth ſhould ſet his hand and ſeale to the confirmation of a falſhood,
or of ſuch Doctrine as is partly true, and partly falſe. The Apoſtles
Doctrine was thus confirmed, therfor it was intirely true and in no part either
falſe or vncertaine. I ſay, in no part of that which they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>livered conſtantly as a
certaine divine Truth, and which had the Atteſtation of Divine Miracles. For,
that the Apoſtles themſelves, even after the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt,
were, and through inadvertence or prejudice, continued for a tyme in errour
repugnant to a revealed Truth, it is vnanſwerably evident from the ſtory of
the Acts of the Apoſtles. For notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding our Saviours express warrant
and injunction to goe and preach to all Nations, yet vntill S. Peter was better
informed by a viſion from Heaven, and by the converſion of Cornelius, both
h<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, and the reſt of the Church held is vnlawfull for them to goe or preach
the Goſpell to any but the Iewes.</hi> And (Pag. 145. N. 33.) you ſay, the
Apoſtles could not be <hi>the Churches Foundations without freedome from
errour in all thoſe things which they delivered conſtantly, as certaine
revealed Truths.</hi> Do not theſe words overthrow Chriſtian Religion, and
Authority of Scriptures?</p>
               <p n="29">29. Theſe conditions you require that the Doctrine of
the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les be to vs certaine, and receyved as Divine Truth. 1. It muſt
be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered conſtantly. 2 It muſt be delivered <hi>as a Divine
Truth.</hi> 3. <hi>It muſt haue the Arteſtation of Divine Miracles;</hi>
and theſe conditions you require for every part therof. For you ſay, the
Doctrine of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les was <hi>falſe or vncertaine in no part,</hi> and
then you add expreſſly this limitation, <hi>I ſay, in no part of that
which they delivered conſtantly, as a certaine Divine Truth, and which had
the Arteſtation of Divine Maracies</hi> You cannot deny but that the
Apoſtles, if they conceyved that the Goſpell was not to be preached to the
Gentills, did frame that opiny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <pb n="299" facs="tcp:59214:158"/>out of ſome
apprehended Revelation (for example, 
<q rend="margQuotes">In viam gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium ne abieritis (Matth:
10.5.) Into the way of the Gentiles goe ye not, or (Matth: 15.24.) I was not
ſent but to the ſheep that are loſt of the houſe of Iſrael,</q> or
ſome other) and ſo delivered a thing conceyved by them to be a Divine
Truth, yet they were deceyved in that Poynt, becauſe it wanted the other
conditions of conſtancy, and Atteſtation of Divine Miracles; and
conſequently your doctrine muſt be, that every Point of Faith muſt haue
all the ſayd three conditions, and that the Apoſtles after the ſending of
the Holy Ghoſt, might faile in ſome of them, and might teach an errour in
delivering matters concerning Faith and Religion.</p>
               <p n="30">30. If this be ſo; what certainty can we now haue, that
they on whom Chriſtians are builded as vpon their Foundation (Epheſ. 2.20)
haue not erred in writing, as then they erred in ſpeaking? And in
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, whether they did not erre in ſetting downe that very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
which (Pag: 137. N. 21.) You cite out of S. Matth: (29.19.) <hi>Goe and teach
all Nations:</hi> And ſo at this preſent, we cannot be certaine, whether
the Apoſtles erred in their firſt thoughts of not preaching, or in their
ſecond, of preaching the Goſpell to Gentils. If they were vniverſally
aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt, they could erre in neither; without it, in
both: and if once you deny ſuch an vniverſall aſſiſtance, we cannot
poſſibly know when they are to be truſted; and how can you be certaine,
that S. Luke hath not erred in declaring this very Story, out of which you
would proue that S. Peter and the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did erre? You grant (Pag:
35. N. 7.) That the <hi>meanes to decide Controverſyes in Faith and Religion,
muſt be indued with an vniverſall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, in whatſoever it
propoundeth for a Divine Truth. For if it may be falſe in any one thing of
this nature, in any thing which God requires men to belieue, we can yield vnto
it but a wavering and fearfull Aſſent in any thing.</hi> Seing therfor you
teach, that the Apoſtles were decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a thing, which God <hi>required
them to belieue,</hi> and commanded them to practiſe; according to your owne
ſaying, <hi>we can yield vnto</hi> them <hi>but a wavering and fearfull
aſſent in any thing.</hi> What the Apoſtles ſpoke or preached, they
might haue written (it is your owne ſaying (Pag: 54. N. 7.) <hi>Whatſoever
is delivered by word of mouth, may alſo be written:</hi>) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had it
bene more or less true or falſe, by being committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, than if it
had bene only ſpoken or preached: and ſo if they could erre in ſpeaking,
we cannot be ſure but that their writings may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <pb n="300" facs="tcp:59214:159"/>ſome errour, proceeding from <hi>inadvertence or prejudice, or
ſome other cauſe,</hi> as you ſpeake (Pag: 137. N. 21.) This I may
confirme by what you ſay to <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> (Pag: 84.86.) <hi>D. Fields
words, I confess, are ſomwhat more presſing, and if he had bene infallible,
and the words had not ſlipt vnadviſedly from him, they were the beſt
Argument in your Booke.</hi> In which words, I note, that although D. Field had
bene <hi>infallible,</hi> yet <hi>words might haue ſlipt from him
vnadviſedly</hi> even in writing (for you ſpeake of what he hath written in
his Book) and therfor much more if the Apoſtles were ſuppoſed to haue
bene fallible, and actually to haue erred, (as you ſay they did) why might
not their errour haue <hi>vnadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly ſlipt from them into</hi> their
writings?</p>
               <p n="31">31. If you anſwer, that it belongs to Gods providence,
not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an errour to be ſet downe in writing, and conveyed to
poſterity: I reply; by this very Reaſon it is cleare, that God could not
permitt the Apoſtles to erre againſt any revealed Truth, and yet oblige vs
to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue with certainty their writings, which we can belieue only for the
Authority and Infallibility of the Writers; eſpecially, ſince you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that this errour of theirs is alſo transmitted to poſterity, by being
recorded by S. Luke whom you alledg: and ſo if your falſe aſſertion
were true, we are as ſure that they held an errour, as that they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
any truth, becauſe we belieue both by the ſame Authority of ſcripture;
yea according to your doctrine related aboue, we are not obliged to belieue,
that ſcripture it ſelf is the word of God, and yet are bound to belieue the
truths delivered therin, one of which you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to be, that the Apoſtles
did erre, and therfor we muſt belieue that they erred, and yet may deny the
Authority of ſcripture, which relates that errour. God, I ſay cannot in his
Holy Providence be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to himſelf, and oblige vs to belieue with
certainty, the writing of thoſe whom we belieue to haue erred, and yet for
whoſe Infallibility we belieue thoſe very writings to be infallible. For,
the Apoſtles were not infallible becauſe they wrote Scripture; but we
belieue Scripture to be infallible, becauſe it was written by the Apoſtles,
who by Divine Meanes (even before they wrote any Scripture) immediate proved
themſelves to be infallible and worthy of all credit, and ſo mediate
thoſe ſame Meanes, proved their writings to be Divine and infallible. We
could not belieue any Booke to be Canonicall, if we did thinke it delivered any
one point contrary to ſome other Part of the Scripture; and how can we
certainly belieue the Apoſtles in other Matters of <pb n="301" facs="tcp:59214:159"/>Faith, if we once yeld them to haue erred and contradicted truth, in
any one?</p>
               <p n="32">32. The ſecond condition required by you, for
aſſuring vs, that the Doctrine of the Apoſtles was neither falſe, nor
vncertaine, is, that it be delivered by them as a certaine Divine Truth. This
alſo is a ſource of vncertaintyes. For Scripture is not wont to declare
expreſſly, or as I may ſay, in actu ſignato, whether the Writers therof
intended to deliver this, or that, as a certaine Divine Truth; and though they
had done ſo, yet if their infallibility be not Vniverſall, we could not
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them with certainty in that Declaration: And if their infallibility be
Vniverſall, we muſt belieue them, though they vſe no ſuch
expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of a certaine Divine Truth. Hitherto it hath bene believed,
that Scripture is the word of God, and that all the Verityes contained in it,
though otherwiſe they be but naturall truths, are revealed or teſtifyed by
God, and by that Meanes growe to be both certaine and Divine, as inveſted
with the ſupernaturall Divine Teſtimony. Now if ſome things be delivered
in Scripture, as certaine Divine Truths, others not; you make Scripture an
Aggregate of different kinds of Truths, without being able to giue any
infallible, certaine, generall Rule (and not only ſome probable conjecture of
your owne) to know poſitively, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, when the Scripture ſpeakes
of one kind, and when of another; which yet in your grounds is neceſſary
for giving vs aſſurance, whether the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, be
entirely true and in no part falſe or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine. For if that condition of
delivering a certaine Divine Truth, do not ſubſiſt, we haue not a
ſufficient ground to exerciſe an act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Faith, and ſo we cannot
be obliged to believe the contents of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="33">33. The third condition which you require for our
aſſurance, that the Doctrine of the Apoſtles be entirely true, is, that
it haue the atteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Divine Miracles; which either diſcredits the
writings of the Apoſtles, and moſt of the Uerityes contayned in them; or
els confutes your onwe. Doctrine that the Apoſtles might erre in Matters
belonging to Religion For if you meane, that every particular Truth which they
preached, muſt be confirmed by Miracles, you diſoblige men from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
innumerable Points of Scripture, for which we haue no proofe, that they were
ſo particularly confirmed; yea we haue no proofe from Scripture, that the
Apoſtles did ever directly and immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme by Miracles, that it is
the word of God; and yet vpon this ground <pb n="302" facs="tcp:59214:160"/>all the
pretended Religion of Proteſtants, that is, the whole Bible, and Truths
conteyned therin, depends. If your meaning be only, that it was ſufficient
for the belief of every particular Truth, which the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſpoke, or
wrote, that by Miracles, Sanctity of life, and other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted arguments, they
approoved themſelves as it were in generall, that they were worthy of credit
in all Matters belonging to Religion; then you cannot maintayne, that S. Peter,
who wrought many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to proue himſelf a man ſent from, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d approved,
by God, did erre in that particular mayne article about preaching the Goſpell
to Gentils; or if he could erre in that, we cannot believe his words or writing
in many other Points not confirmed in particular by Miracles. The ſame I
ſay of the other Apoſtles, Preachers, and Canonicall Writers. Laſtly; I
confute theſe your errours by your owne words (Pag. 290. N. 88.) <hi>To
ſpeak properly, not any ſet knowne company of men is ſecured, that,
though they neglect the meanes of avoiding error, yet certainly they ſhall
not erre, which were neceſſary for the conſtitution of an infallible
guide of Faith.</hi> But you ſay (Pag. 114. N. 155.) <hi>The Apoſtles
perſons while they were living were the only Iudges of controverſies;</hi>
And (Pag. 60. N. 17.) That none <hi>is fit to be judge but he that is
infallible:</hi> Therfore according to you, we muſt inferr, that the
Apoſtles were ſecured not to erre, though they were ſuppoſed to
<hi>neglect the meanes of avoiding error,</hi> and conſequently they neither
did, nor could erre by <hi>inadvertence or prejudice,</hi> or by any neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of <hi>the meanes to avoide error.</hi> Beſide (Pag. 146. N. 34.) you ſay,
<hi>The Apoſtles were led into all Truths by the Spirit, efficaciter: The
Church is led alſo into all truths by the Apoſtles writings,
ſufficienter.</hi> How then could the Apoſtles actually fall into any
error, ſeing they were effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer led into all truths? And yet againe, you
contradict yourſelf, and ſay (Pag 177. N. 77.) <hi>Ye are the ſalt of the
earth, ſaid our Saviour to his Diſciples: not that this quality was
inſeparable from their Perſons, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was theyr office to be
ſo. For if they must haue been ſo of necesſity, and could not haue been
otherwiſe, in vain had he put them in feare of that which followes, if the
ſalt haue loſt his Savour, &amp;c.</hi> If this be ſo, what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
can we haue that de facto the Apoſtles did not erre, ſeing they may
erre?</p>
               <p n="34">34. Your Objection is eaſily anſwered. S. Peter
himſelf never doubted whether the Goſpell were to be preached to the
Gentils. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any ſuch thing be proved out of the (11. and 12.) of
the acts as you pretend. (Pag. 137. N. 21.) The Viſion recorded in thoſe
Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <pb n="303" facs="tcp:59214:160"/>as exhibited to S. Peter, was ordayned to the
ſatisfaction, not of all Chriſtians, but of converted Jewes, who were
offended with him for converſing with Gentiles, as is evident (Chap. 11. V.
2.3.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">They that were of the Circumciſion
(that is, Jewes made Chriſtians) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned againſt him, ſaying, why
didſt thou enter into men vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and didſt eate with them? And
accordingly S. Chryſoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me (Hom. 24. in Act. Cap. 11.) ſaith; Thoſe
who were of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, not the Apoſtles, did contend. They were
offended (ſaith the ſcripture) not a litle, and marke vpon what pretenſe.
They ſayd not, why haſt thou preacht? But why haſt thou eaten? Neither
did they object that, (of preaching) for they knew that it was the gift of
God.</q> According to which ſaying, even the converted Jewes were not
offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with S. Peter for preaching to, but for eating, with, Gentils. That
before the converſion of Cornelius, other Gentils were become Chriſtians,
Cornel. a Lapide (in Act. Cap. 10. poſt verſum 48.) affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and proves by
divers arguments: and therfor S. Peter was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that he and the other
Apoſtles were to preach to the Gentils, but he did abſtaine from preaching
publikly, and as it were ſolemnly, to avoide the offence of Jewes converted
to Chriſt till by this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſion he might ſweetly a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d effectually
perſwade them that ſuch was the will of God. Thus S. John Chryſ: (Hom:
22. in Act: Cap: 10) ſaith; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Becauſe it was ſo to fall out, that
they would all accuſe Peter as a breaker of the law, which was very common
with them, he ſayd neceſſarily and opportunely, I haue never eaten. Did
he himſelf feare? God forbid. But Gods ſpirit did ſo direct him, that he
might haue in readynes, a defenſe againſt thoſe who would reprehend him,
&amp;c: (Not ô Lord, becauſe I haue never eaten any common or vncle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane
thing) And a voyce came to him; That which God hath puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, do not thou call
common. This ſeemed to be ſpoken to him, but indeed it was wholy directed
to the Jewes;</q> for if the maiſter (S. Peter) be blamed, much more they:
that is the Jewes for thinking that it was vnlawfull to eate with Gentils. It
appeares then, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. Peter nor the other Apoſtles, did feare to
deale and preach to the Gentils, but the Holy Ghoſt 
<q rend="margQuotes">ſpiritus moderabatur,</q> (as S.
Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome ſpeakes,) and ordained all for the ſatisfaction of
others.</p>
               <p n="35">35. But for better vnderſtanding this whole matter, we
are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on three things. For, we may conſider; firſt, the eating of
Jewes with Gentils: 2. Eating meates forbidden to the Jewes. 3. preaching 
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59214:161"/>to them. Now, S. Chryſoſtome, as we haue ſeene,
obſerves, that the Jewes were offended with S. Peter for eating with Gentils,
and if we conſider, as I may ſay, the letter, or the moſt immediate
literall ſenſe of the viſion made to S. Peter, it had reſpect to the
Law of the Jewes, to whom certaine meates were forbidden, and eſteemed
vncleane, as appeares (Chap: 10. V. 12.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Where in were all fourfooted beaſts
and that creepe on the earth, and foules of the aire; and accordingly S. Peter
ſayd (V. 14.) I haue never eaten any common or vncleane thing.</q> And there
is not any thing ſayd directly and preciſely of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching to Gentils, but
at moſt by conſequence, becauſe the Apoſtles could not commonly and
conſtantly preach to them, but that they ſhould haue occaſion to eate
with them: or els by way of ſignification, or that vncleane meates in
generall, did alſo ſignify Gentils, whom the Jewes eſteemed as it were
vncleane and irreligious perſons: Yet prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and Eating are of their
nature, different: as, we may deale with an excommunicate perſon for his
converſion, though ordinarily we may not eate with him. This being ſo; you
cannot affirme, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did thinke it vnlawfull to preach to the
Gentils, vnless you do alſo belieue that they judged Chriſtians converted
from Judaiſme, to be obliged to obſerue the whole Law of the Jewes, in
conformity to the viſion preſented to S. Peter, of all ſorts of beaſts
or meates which the Jewes could not lawfully eate. Will you grant this? Will
you ranke the Apoſtles with that faction of Phariſees converted to
Chriſt, which troubled the moſt primitiue Church, by preaching that the
Jewiſh Law was neceſſary to ſalvation, even for converted Gentils? S.
Paul ſayth, 
<q rend="margQuotes">If you be circumfiſed, Chriſt
ſhall profit you nothing</q> (Gal: 5. N. 2.) And do you thinke, that the
Apoſtles were in an errour, which muſt draw vpon them ſo heauy a doome? A
Councell was gathered about this matter, not that the Apoſtles could doubt
therof, but for ſatisfaction and quiet of Chriſtians: and in like manner,
that viſion was ſhewed to S. Peter, not for rectifying any errour of his
owne about preaching to Gentils, but for pacifying and ſetling the mynds of
Jewes converted to Chriſtianity. Haue we not heard you ſay (Pag. 101. N.
127.) That it is cleare in Scripture, that the obſervation of the Moſaicall
Law is not neceſſary? And therfor it cannot be imagined that the
Apoſtles, for whoſe authority we belieue the ſcripture, could doubt
therof. Or if you thinke the Apoſtles might erre about the neceſſity of
obſerving the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall Law, what certainty can we haue, notwithſtanding
the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="305" facs="tcp:59214:161"/>of that firſt Councell, but that
ſtill we may thinke the keeping of Moyſes his Law to be neceſſary? you
ſee how much you did exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in ſaying; that the Apoſtles them
ſelves, for a tyme continued in an errour repugnant to a revealed Truth, is
vnanſwerably evident from the ſtory of the acts of the Apoſtles; ſeing
this Story, as you will needs vnderſtand it, doth either proue nothing for
your purpoſe, or more than you will grant, or is true in itſelf, and ſo
by proving too much you come to proue nothing at all: and this only remaynes
true; That although ſcripture did containe all neceſſary truths. yet we
could not belieue them, for ſuch a ſcripture as you offer vs, which
certainly could be no Rule of Faith at all.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Your Third errour (for I am willing to reduce them to
as ſmall a number as I can, though in thoſe which I haue layd togeather in
gross, many particulars, diſtinct from one another, are involved, as for
example, every one of the conditions which you require for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of
the writings of the Apoſtles, be ſo many ſeverall errours) Your third
errour, I ſay, is ſet downe in the ſame (Pag: 144. in the next Number
32.) in theſe words: <hi>For thoſe things which they profess to deliver as
the dictates of humane reaſon and prudence, and not as Divine Revelations,
why we ſhould take them to be Divine Revelations, I ſee no reaſon; nor
how we can do ſo, and not contradict the Apoſtles, and God himſelf.
Therfor when S. Paul ſayes</hi> (1. <hi>Epiſt: to the Cor:</hi> 7.12.)
<hi>To the reſt ſpeake I, not the Lord; And againe, concerning Virgins I

commandment, ſhall we not plainly contradict S. Paul, and that Spirit by
which he wrote? Which moved him to write, as in other places Divine
Revelations, which he certainly knew to be ſuch, ſo in this place his owne
judgment, touching ſome things which God had not particularly revealed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="37">37. This your doctrine I confute as I haue done your
other errours. For, if the Apoſtles ſomtyme deliver things as the
<hi>dictates of humane Reaſon and prudence,</hi> we cannot belieue with
certainty any thing they deliver, vnless you con giue vs a certaine Rule, how
to diſcerne when they vtter ſuch things, and when they deliver Divine
Revelations. Yea, according to your Principles, who muſt proue all by
Scripture alone, you muſt giue vs ſuch a certaine Rule, out of ſome
evident Text of Scripture. As you teach, that God may permit true Miracles 
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59214:162"/>to be wrought to delude men, much more may you ſay,
that he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Apoſtles to write their owne dictamen and judgment,
without declaring whether they write only ſuch dictamens, or els deliver
divine Revelations.</p>
               <p n="38">38. S. Paul in this ſeaventh Chapter which you cite (V.

happyer if ſhe ſo abide, after my judgment: and I think alſo that I haue
the ſpirit of God.</hi> Now conſider, I pray you, that S. Paul in theſe
words adviſes a thing for widdowes, which God hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and ſo
might haue ſayd in this place, I ſpeake, not our Lord, and then when he
adds; I thinke alſo, that I haue the ſpirit of God; I aske whether he
ſpeake theſe words out of humane prudence, or by divine Revelation and
inſpiration? If he ſpeake by divine Revelation, you haue no reaſon to
ſay, that he delivers not a divine Revelation, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 12.) he ſayes, 
<q rend="margQuotes">To the reſt ſpeake I, not our
Lord.</q> But if S. Paul in theſe words, I think alſo that I haue the
ſpirit of God, ſpeake not out of divine inſpiration, but only out of a
probable hope or perſwaſion that he had the ſpirit of God, how can we
belieue by divine infallible Faith that his writings are true in any Point?
Eſpecially if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he teaches, widdowes would be more
bleſſed if they remayned ſo, for this very Reaſon that he adviſes it,
and that he thinks himſelf to haue the ſpirit of God: which proofe
ſuppoſes that he was indued with an vniverſall infallibility, and that
therfor his counſell in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular matter was beſt. And this word (I
thinke) might with greater ſhew of reaſon, make men belieue that S. Paul
was not certaine, that he had the ſpirit of God, then the reaſon which you
alledg that he ſpoke out of humane prudence. For, what conſequence is this?
Our Lord hath commanded nothing in this particular, but I giue this adviſe or
Counſell as the beſt; Therfor S. Paul ſpeakes not by divine
inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Or thus: by inſpiration I ſay God hath not commanded:
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſpeake not by inſpiration in that which I Counſell: as if God
could not inſpire both parts of this ſpeach, that is, both his ſaying,
that God did command, and yet, that the thing not commanded was better than the
contrary, ſeing both thoſe Propoſitions are true, and ſo one excluds
not the other, but both may be inſpired by the author of Truth. Nay, if you
ſay he ſpoke by inſpiration for one part, (that there 
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59214:162"/>was no command) it is very inconſequent to affirme that
be ſpoke not by the like inſpiration in the other (I judge it the better:)
and if he ſpoke by inſpiration in both, he ſpoke only out of humane
prudence, in neither. In thoſe words, 
<q rend="margQuotes">I haue not a Command of our Lord for
Virgins, but I giue Counſell,</q> doth S. Paul ſay any more, than that
virginity is not commanded, or neceſſary to ſalvation, [which I hope you
will ſay is a revealed Truth but only I counſell it? And by what art can
you perſvvade men that he ſpoke the firſt] I haue not a command of our
Lord by Revelation, and not the ſecond, conſidering that S. Paul makes no
ſuch difference in his act of belief, or as I may ſay, ex parte ſubjecti,
but only in the Object, for not being commanded, but only counſelled; both
vvhich, as I ſayd, being true, both might be vtterd by divine inſpiration,
as indeed they vvere. And thoſe other vvords, ſpeake I, not our Lord,
ſhevv only, that our B. Saviour left povver to the Apoſtles and their
Succeſſours to adviſe, Counſell, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, or command ſome things, as
ſeverall occaſions might require vvhich he himſelf had not commanded in
particular. Which is a moſt certaine Truth and the ground of Obedience and
ſubordination to Lavvfull Paſtors in Gods Church, and cannot be denyed by
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants themſelves; and therfor it is not only a dictate of humane
prudence.</p>
               <p n="39">39. All this will appeare more manifeſt; if we ponder
S. Paules words as they lye. He ſayth (V. 5.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Defraud not one another, except

returne againe togeather, leaſt Satan tempt you for your incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency. Where
we may conſider how in the firſt part of this Verſe, there is a command
of God; (defraud not one another) except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by conſent for a tyme, that
you may giue yourſelves to prayer,</q> (in the greeke, and to faſting)
which is not a command, but a counſell: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thirdly, returne againe

<q rend="margQuotes">But I ſay this by indulgence, not by

ſayth; For I would all men to be as my ſelf: and (V. 8.) But I ſay to the

whether in all theſe S. Paul ſpoke by Revelation, or only out of humane
prudence? <pb n="308" facs="tcp:59214:163"/>Or how can you (without any leaſt reaſon)
imagine, that in ſome of them he ſpoke one way, in others, another? And if
you ſay ſo, you will only clearly confirme what I ſayd, that we can haue
no certainty, when he vtters things revealed or only his owne judgment. For,
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the words rehearſed, he ſay not expreſſly, not I, but, our
Lord, nor, not our Lord, but I; yet he might haue ſayd ſo, ſeing he
declared both a Commandement of God, and ſo might haue ſaied, (not I but
our Lord) and a Conunſell, and might haue ſaied (not our Lord, but I) And
therfor when he ſayth (V. 10. and 11.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">But to them that be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in

the reſt, I ſay, and not our Lord,</q> you cannot infer, that he ſpeakes
by another ſpirit or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then in the precedent verſes where he might
haue vſed the ſame words, not our Lord, but I and, not I, but our Lord, and
therfor he muſt be vnderſtood to ſpeak by divine inſpiration in all, or
none.</p>
               <p n="40">40 But I pray you, in any part of this Chapter, or in any
part of all S. Paules Writings, doth he ever ſay; in this God inſpires me
to ſpeake, and I ſpeak not of my ſelf: in this other, God doth not
inſpire me to ſpeak, but I ſpeak of my ſelf? Is it all one to ſay;
God commands, not I; and to ſay, God inſpires, and I ſpeak not of my
ſelf; Or I command, not God; that is I adviſe of my ſelf, not inſpired
by God? Command or counſell, are words of verie different ſignifications
from inſpired or not inſpired; neither can any man preciſely infer one
from another, as you would make vs belieue, that S. Paul was inſpired, when
he ſayd, God commands; and not inſpired when he ſayd, I Counſell. And
if you ſay, S. Paul ſpoke not by inſpiration when he ſayd, I giue
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; with what certainty can you ſay, that even his ſetting downe
in writing the Command of God, and his owne counſell, proceeded from
inſpiration? And ſo we can haue no certainty of S. Paules wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, vnless
we belieue that he ſpoke by inſpiration as well when he gaue adviſe, and
Counſell, as when he declared a Divine Command. And therfor after he had
ſayd (V. 40.) of widdowes; 
<q rend="margQuotes">more bleſſed ſhall ſhe be, if
ſhe ſo remaine according to my counſell, he adds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and I
thinke that I alſo haue the ſpirit of God;</q> leaſt any ſhould thinke
he ſpoke and adviſed, only out of humane prudence, and not by Divine
inſpiration, as if the Holy Ghoſt had forſeene, that there 
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59214:163"/>would not want ſuch blaſphemers, as you are. S.
Chryſoſtome (Hom. 19. in Cap. 7.1. Cor.) ſpeaking of the words of S.
Paul, Ego &amp; non ego, I and not I: ſayth; that they ſignify the Precept
of God, and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of S. Paul, as I ſayd; and then adds, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Leaſt you ſhould thinke thoſe
things to be humane, therfore he added, and I think that I haue alſo the
ſpirit of God. And the ſame Holy Father (apud Salme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronem Tom. 14. Diſp.
12. Pag 94.) ſayth; For that cauſe, he, S. Paul, ſayd; not our Lord, but
I; not meaning to ſignify therby, that that was a humane ſaying; for how
can that be? But that Chriſt had not delivered that precept to his
Diſciples while he was vpon earth, but doth now deliver it by him. And
afterward: feare not: for I ſayd ſo, becauſe that I haue Chriſt
ſpeaking in me, neither do thou ſuſpect, that that ſpeach is in any
part humane. And Theodoret. (ap. Salm: ib.) writes vpon theſe words, in this
manner; this I ſay; which ſignifyes, I haue not found this Law written in
the Goſpells, but now I ordaine it. And that the Lawes of the Apoſtle are
the Lawes of God is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to thoſe who are inſtructed in Divine
Matters. For it is his voyce: ſeeke you an experiment of him that ſpeaketh
in me, Chriſt? And S. Auſtine (Tract. 37. in Joan.) hath theſe words;
Somtyme men, of thoſe things of which they are certaine, ſeeme by way of
reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to doubt; that is, they vſe a word of doubting, when indeed
in their hart they doubt not: as if thou be angry with thy ſervant, and
ſay; thou contemneſts me, conſider, perhaps I am thy maſter. Hence it
is that the Apoſtle ſayth to ſome who did deſpiſe him; (juſt as you
doe) and I think that I alſo haue the ſpirit of God. He that ſayes I
thinke, ſeemes to doubt: but he did reprehend, and not doubt.</q> And
Chriſt our Lord reprehending the future infidelity of mankind, ſaith, (Luc:
18. V. 8.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">The ſonne of man comming ſhall he
find think you, Faith in the earth?</q> Thus S. Auſtine. If then S Paul did
ſpeak with certainty in a thing not commanded by our Saviour, who dare deny
but that he did it by inſpiration? and it is cleare S. Paul ſpeaks this 
<q rend="margQuotes">(And I think, that I alſo haue the
ſpirit of God)</q> not of any command of God, but of a Counſell, which he
gaue for widdowes to abſtaine from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: in which therfor thoſe his
words, not our Lord but I, haue place. And indeed, as S. Paul, if he had
ſpoken only the dictates of humane reaſon and bene ſubject to errour,
when he ſayd (V. 10.11.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">To them that be joyned in matrimony,
not I giue commandment, but our Lord, that the wife depart not from her

had put a great command vpon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for which he had no certainty or

be not ſo indeed (as he might erre if he ſpoke only by humane prudence) he
had much diminiſhed the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall freedom, which people haue to marry, or
perpetually liue chaſt. For though he did not command it, yet to perſons of
timorous conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and deſirous to do what they are taught to be moſt

                  </gap>cline them, therto. For, the Corinthians, in thoſe Queſtions
which they propoſed, and S. Paul anſwers in this Chapter, had recourſe to
Him not as to a wiſe man only, or as a private perſon, for dictates of
humane reaſon, but as to an Apoſtle, from whom they expected vndoubted
anſwers, by Revelation from God, vpon which they might ſecurely build their
Chriſtian Faith, in matters of ſo great moment: and as they believed him
ſpeaking of our Saviours command againſt divorce, ſo they believed him
adviſing chaſtity, and ſuppoſed they might doe it as ſafely in both,
as in one for, Point of S. Paules being inſpired. And this conſideration
vrges ſo much the more, as the Corinthians were like to fynd greater
difficulty in thoſe Points, for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to remaine alwayes ſuch, and for
widdowes to abſtaine from a ſecond marriage; in regard they were much given
to ſenſuall delights, as Writers haue obſerved, and appeares out of S.
Paul in divers places; and therfor to exhort them in thoſe beginnings to
perpetuall chaſtity, had bene both burthen ſome and dangerous to them, and
not ſafe for S. Paul himſelfe, if he had done it without certainty,
communicated by divine inſpiration.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Thus we ſee, that he having (V. 35.) counſelled
virginity, preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly (V. 36) addes; 
<q rend="margQuotes">a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this I ſpeak to your profit: not
to caſt a ſnare vppon you; as like wiſe having ſayd (V. 27.) Art thou
looſe from a wife? Seeke not a wife: he adds, (V. 18.) but if thou take a
wife, thou haſt not ſinned:</q> and is it not a very prepoſterous
conceipt, to ſay, that in the firſt part, ſeeke not a wife, which is a
counſell, he vtters only a dictate of prudence; and in the ſecond, if thou
take a wife, thou haſt not ſinned which implyes a matter of Faith, he
ſpeakes by inſpiration? What is this but to bring all the writings of S.
Paul to an vncertainty? And, as I ſayd aboue by the like occaſion, to make
holy ſcripture a confuſed aggregatum per accidens, of truths different in
nature and kind; and, as I may ſay, to incorporate with Gods word 
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59214:164"/>Apocryphall Writings, which are ſo called, not
becauſe they may not be true, but becauſe they are not Divine, as the

of a falſhood,</hi> at leaſt now all the words of S. Paul are atteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

confirmed by Miracles; it is as good, in order to vs, as if none had bene ſo
confirmed; ſince the Miracles themſelves do not ſpecify, what in
particular they confirme, and what not: and ſo we can only belieue in
generall, that ſome Points contayned in the Bible, are Truths; but this is
not enough to belieue with certainty any one in particular. Beſides all this,
S. Paul in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling virginity, counſells the ſame which our B.
Saviour had done before, as is recorded (Matth: 12.12.) and therfor he delivers
a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation which he knew to be ſuch, and ſpoke not out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
prudence, as you would haue him. If it be objected; how then doth he ſay: I
ſpeak not, but our Lord? Ianſwer. It cannot be ſayd, I ſpeak not by

I ſpeak ſignifyes, I counſell, adviſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or permit, by

You know, Catholiques are wont to alledg this Chapter of S. Paul, to proue as a
Point of Faith, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of perperuall virginity; and yet never any of
our Adverſaryes, haue excepted againſt this Argument by ſaying; S. Paul
profeſſes to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that matter, only as a dictate of humane reaſon,
and not as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation; which had been a cleare and vnanſwerable
reply, that we could not proue by that place perpetuall virginity to be more
perfect, as a Point of Faith, if they had bene of your mynd; and they might
eaſily haue told vs, that we could not proue an Article of Faith, by words
which the Apoſtle himſelf profeſſes to containe but a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane dictamen.

that the Lord did certainly ſpeak what S. Paul ſpeakes, and that his
judgment was Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, ſhall we not plainly contradict S. Paul, and

judgment was Gods command? Contrarily, when his judgment is, that ſuch a

Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſaying, (V. 12.) it was no command, ſpeake I, not our

               <p n="43">43. Now vpon the whole matter; it followes out of this
your Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: that although all things neceſſary to be believed, were
contayned in ſcripture; yet that were not enough to make it a ſufficient
Rule, or any Rule at all, for Chriſtian Faith: ſeing we cannot be
abſolutely certaine, when the writers therof ſet downe divine Revelations,
or only dictates of humane reaſon: yea and as you ſay S. Paul was not
inſpired by God, when he Counſelled virginity, and conſequently might
haue erred therin; ſo we cannot be ſure, that indeed he gaue any ſuch
judgment or counſell, but that as in counſelling, ſo in writing and
ſetting downe that counſell, he was no more aſſiſted by
Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in giving it. And I will end with theſe words of
<hi>Chriſtanity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> (about the ſayd Texts of S. Paul) (Chap:

<q rend="margQuotes">Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if the Apoſtles did

(Pag. 62. N. 25) that Bookes that are not Canonicall may ſay they are, and
thoſe that are ſo, may ſay nothing of it: ſo we cannot be aſſured,
that the Apoſtles deliver Divine Revelations, though they ſhould ſay,
they doe; nor that they deliver not ſuch Revelations though they ſay

neceſſarily follow, that the aſſurance which we haue of ſcripture,
muſt not only be of the ſame kind, but be farr less for the degree of it;
ſeing the bookes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Authors, haue a more full teſtimony and
tradition of all ſorts of men, Atheiſts, Pagans, Jewes, Turkes, and
Chriſtians; wheras the Bible was either vnknowen, or impugned, or not much
regarded by all, except Chriſtians, and by ſome alſo who pretended to the

ſcripture was once loſt, as ſome ſay, or at leaſt lay hid; and
Chriſtians had not thoſe commodityes, to tranſcribe faithfully Copyes of
the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which pagans had for publiſhing their Bookes: Whence it
comes to pass, that we find not ſo many divers readings, in Cicero, Virgill,

many vulgar Translations, and Editions, to what vncertainty ſhall we be
brought, if we proceed only by humane morall aſſurance of ſcripture,
without any living viſible Guide (the Church) ſo directed by the holy
Ghoſt, as we may be moſt certainly aſſured, that ſhe will either
neuer permit ſuch corruptions to happen, or will never make vſe of them: As
we were aſſured, the Apoſtles could never approue any corruption in
ſcripture, though in their tymes it could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded, but that Errours
might be committed, by the diverſity of tranſcribers ſo many centuryes of

alledg, that <hi>Divine providence will never ſuffer the way to Heaven to be
blocked vp, or made inviſible;</hi> which no man denyes; but ſeing his holy
Providence cannot be contrary to itſelf, and dispoſes of all things
ſweetly, by Meanes proportionable to his Ends, we muſt even from hence
gather, that he hath left Meanes to beget a true divine ſupernaturall Faith,
more firme than we yield to humane ſtoryes: which cannot be done by
ſcripture alone, if we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be certaine that it is not corrupted, nor
haue any other infallible Guide to rely on, beſides the bare written word;
and ſo this your As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion proves that which you ſeeke moſt to avoyd,
that ſcripture <pb n="314" facs="tcp:59214:166"/>alone, even though it were falsly
ſuppoſed to contayne all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believed, cannot be
ſufficient to erect an Act of Faith, for want of ſtrength of an infallible
authority, becauſe ſtill we remayne vncertaine and vnſatisfyed, whether
perhaps it be not corrupted in that part vpon which we build our

               <p n="54">54. Your ſift Errour, not vnlike to this, I touched
aboue out of your (Pag. 116. N. 159.) where you ſay; <hi>We haue, I belieue,
as great reaſon to belieue there was ſuch a man as Henry the eight King of
England, as that Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered Vnder Pontius Pilate.</hi> You
ſhould haue ſayd; we haue farr greater reaſon to belieue that there was
ſuch a man, as Henry the eight, or Alexander, Caeſar, Pompey, &amp;c: if
your falſe Aſſertion were true, that Chriſtian Faith rihes no higſer
than humane Tradition, and ſtory can raiſe it. For we haue a more full and
vniverſall Tradition, and Conſent of all ſorts of Perſons, that there
were ſuch men as Caeſar, &amp;c: and that they fought ſuch battailes,
obtained ſuch victoryes, and the like, than that there was one called Jeſus
Chriſt, that he had Diſciples &amp;c: And what Chriſtian can heare this
without deteſtation? Your ſaying, that we haue as great reaſon to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue there was ſuch a man as Henry the eight, as that Jeſus Chriſt
ſuffered &amp;c: ſeemes to ſignify, that we haue as great reaſon to
belieue what is delivered by humane Hiſtory or Tradition, as that which is
teſtifyed or revealed by God, ſince you pretend to belieue that
ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which gives witness to Chriſt Jeſus, is the word of God, and
yet affirme that we haue as great reaſon to belieue, there was ſuch a man
as Henry the eight (which we know only by humane tradition) as that Jeſus
Chriſt ſuffered Vnder Pontius Pilate, which we learne from ſcripture. If
you grant this, as it ſeemes you expreſſly doe; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your
ground muſt be, that which you express (Pag: 36. N. 8.) that the
<hi>Concluſion alwayes followes the worſer part: as if a meſſage be
brought me from a man of abſolute credit with me; but by a meſſenger that
is not ſo, my conſidence of the truth of the relation, cannot but be
rebated and leſſened by my diffidence in the Relatour:</hi> and therfor
becauſe we know only by morall certainty (as you ſpeake in the ſame
place) that ſcripture is the word of God, and that the contents therof were
revealed by God, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Miracles, our belief can be proportionable
only to thoſe morall inducements or humane tradition; which being as great
that there was ſuch a man as Henry the eight, as that Jeſus Chriſt
ſuffered &amp;c: we haue as great reaſon to belieue that, as this. If this
be your meaning, <pb n="315" facs="tcp:59214:166"/>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ground; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I inferr,
which hither to I haue not ſo abſolutely done, that Chriſtian Faith, with
you, is not only fallible, and not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely certaine, but alſo is no
more, yea (as I haue proved,) less cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, though it be teſtifyed by God,
than if it had bene teſtifyed, or affirmed to be true by men only; becauſe
all muſt depend on, and be exactly meaſured, not by the difference of
Humane and divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but wholy and only by the meanes or probability
by which ſuch a Teſtimony is conveyed to our vnderſtanding. And this
muſt be the cauſe which moves you to ſay, that we haue as great reaſon
to belieue there was ſuch a man as Henry the eight, as that Jeſus Chriſt
ſuffered Vnder Pontius Pilate: becauſe the Motives are a like, though the
tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of God and of men be different. Or if you ſay, that when we haue
the ſame motiues to belieue that God teſtifyes a thing, and that man doth
teſtify it, we haue greater reaſon to belieue what is teſtifyed by God,
than what is teſtifyed by man; then you contradict what yourſelf ſay,
that we haue as great reaſon to belieue there was ſuch a man as Henry the
eight, as that Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered Vnder Pontius Pilate. Howſoever; I
muſt ſtill conclude, that ſeing, according to your Principles, and
express words, we haue as great, yea, as I haue proved, greater reaſon to
belieue there was a Caeſar, Pompey &amp;c: than Jeſus Chriſt, what will
it availe vs, in order the exerciſing to an Act of true Chriſtian Faith,
that all Points neceſſary to be believed, are contayned in Scripture, if in
the meane tyme we haue as great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to belieue what is related in

neceſſity of believing, that Gods Church, from which we receaue Holy
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is infallibly aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt, than theſe your
Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and pernicious Errours, which yet do naturally reſult from
the Opinyons of thoſe Proteſtants, who deſervedly laughing at the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended private ſpirit of rigid Calviniſts, and yet denying the
infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church, are driven to ſuch Concluſions, as you
publiſh, and for which, thoſe others had diſpoſed the Premiſes. For
if the Scripture be receaved vpon the Authority of the Church, conſidered
only as a company of men ſubject to errour, and not as infallibly directed by
the Holy Ghoſt, who can blame one for inferring, that if thoſe men once
doubted of ſome Bookes of Scripture, ſuch books cannot chalenge ſo firme
a belief, as others in which all haue alwayes agreed? Though even theſe in
which all haue agreed, can never arriue to be believed by an infallible
aſſent of Divine Faith, while theſe men, though never ſo many, are
believed to be fallible.</p>
               <p n="48">48. But to come to your Errour: If it be granted, that we
belieue ſome bookes of Scripture more vndoubtedly then other, by reaſon of
a greater or less conſent, and ſo giue way to more or less in the belief of
Gods word, we ſhall ſoone come to end in nothing. For why may not thoſe
bookes of which ſomtyme there was doubt, and were afterward receyved for
Canonicall, in tyme looſe ſome voices or ſuſſrages, and by that
meanes come to be diſcanonized? You teach that we haue not infallible
certainty, but only a probability for any part of Scripture; how farr then
ſhall we be removed from certainty, for thoſe bookes <pb n="317" facs="tcp:59214:167"/>which participate of that probability in a less and less degree? The
common Doctrine of Proteſtants, is, that Scripture became a totall Rule of
Faith, when the Canon was perfited, becauſe they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine with
certainty, in what particular bookes neceſſary Points are contayned. If
then ſome parts of Canonicall Scripture be more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted than others; in
caſe ſome fundamentall points chance to be ſet downe only in theſe
others, it followes, not only that they cannot be ſo certaine of the Truth of
thoſe neceſſary Points, as of other truths not fundamentall, or of no
neceſſity at all, being conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but alſo that they
cannot be certaine at all; ſince it is ſuppoſed that they do not belieue
thoſe bookes with abſolute certainty, but with a lower degree even of a
probable aſſent. Your pretended Biſhop of London, D. King, in the
beginning of his firſt Lecture vpon Jonas ſayes: <hi>compariſons betwixt
ſcripture and ſcripture, are both odious, and dangerous: The Apoſtles
names are evenly placed in the writings of the holy Fundation. With an
vnpartiall reſpect haue the children of Chriſts family from tyme to tyme,
receyved, reverenced, and embraced the whole volume of ſcriptures.</hi> Marke
that it is both odious and dangerous to make compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons betwixt ſcripture
and ſcripture, and that the children of Chriſts family with an vnpartiall
reſpect receyve the whole Volume of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Yourſelf (Pag 68. N.
42.) ſay, that the controverſy about ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not to be tryed by
moſt Voyces; and what is the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of which we haue heard you
ſpeake in the next (N. 43.) that it was ſufficient to prevaile againſt
the contrary ſuffrages, but only moſt voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or conſent in one
judgment, ſeing you attribute infallibility, or the certaine direction of the
Holy Ghoſt, to no number, great, or ſmall? And as for the greater authority
which in the ſame (N. 43.) you aſcribe to one part more than to another,
what can it be, in your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, except greater learning, or ſome ſuch
kind of Quality, nothing proportionable to that authority, on which Chriſtian
Faith muſt rely? Take away the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of the Holy
Ghoſt, and few for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, even one ſingle perſon, may for waight haue
as good reaſon for what he ſayes, as a great multitude for the contrary.
There is ſcarcely any part of ſcripture, which hath not bene Queſtioned
by ſo many as would haue made men doubt of the works of Cicero, Livie,
&amp;c: as we ſee men doubt of ſome workes, which haue gone vnder the name
of Old Authours, becauſe, for example, Eraſmus, or others, haue called them
in Queſtion, vpon meere conjecturall reaſons, as ſeeming diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence 
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59214:168"/>of Stile, or the like. If then men haue not preſumed to
doubt of ſcripture, as they would haue done of other Writings, it is
becauſe they belieue Gods church to be equally infallible in all that ſhe
propounds, though ſome perhaps doubted before ſuch a Propoſition, or
Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I haue proved, that in your grounds we haue greater certainty for
what is related in humane ſtoryes, then for the contents of the moſt
vndoubted Bookes of ſcripture. What ſtrength then can thoſe Books of
ſcripture haue which you receaue with a less degree of belief?</p>
               <p n="49">49. You Object (Pag: 67. N. 36. and 38.) Some Saints did
once doubt of ſome parts of ſcripture; therfor we haue no <hi>warrant to
damne any man that ſhall doubt of them, or deny them now, having the example
of Saints in Heaven, either to juſtify, or excuſe their doubting or
deniall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="50">50. Anſwer: This very Objection proves the
neceſſity of an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llible Living Judg, as will appeare after I haue
firſt told you, that by this forme of arguing, we may now be ſaved, though
we belieue no part of the whole Bible; becauſe the tyme was when no part of
it was written; We may now adhere to many old Hereſyes, condemned by the
whole Church, which before ſuch a condemnation or definition. Saints might
haue held without damnation, or ſinne: We may now reject the Faith of
Chriſt, becauſe many were Saints and ſaved, in the Law of Nature, and
Moyſes, without it. Yourſelf (Pag: 280. N. 66.) affirme, <hi>That what may
be enough for men in ignorance, may be to kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing men not enough. That the
ſame errour may be not capitall to thoſe who want meanes of finding the
truth, and capitall to others who haue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and neglect to vſe them.</hi>
Howſoever, we Catholikes are ſafe by your owne words, ſince we haue the
example of Saints in Heaven, and holy Fathers, (as is confeſſed even by
Proteſtants) for thoſe Practiſes, and Doctrines, which you will needs
call Errours, beſide S. Bernard, S. Bonaverture, and others, whom
Proteſtants confess to be Saints in Heaven; and therfor by your owne rule you
haue no warrant to damne vs having ſuch examples either to juſtify, or
excuſe vs. If then you will ſtand to your owne doctrine, you cannot deny,
but at one tyme that may conſiſt with ſalvation, which at another tyme is
not compatible therwith. The Church of God hath defined what Bookes be
Canonicall; and this Definition all are obliged vnder payne of damnation to
belieue, and obey. And even by this, we may learne the neceſſity of
acknowledging a Living Judg. All Books which are truly Canonicall, were
propoſed and receyved by Crihſtians. After <pb n="319" facs="tcp:59214:168"/>ward the
knovvledg of ſome Bookes, and ſome truths, began to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, or
doubted of, or denyed by ſome, and perhaps not by a few, and thoſe of great
authority, if we reſpect either learning, or other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, qualityes,
and abilityes, vnder the degree of infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as we ſee there wanted not
in the Apoſtles tyme ſome who were zealous for the obſervation of the
Moſaicall Law: and as theſe could not haue bene confuted, convinced, and
quieted, but by the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the firſt Councell, held in
Jeruſalem; ſo, after ſome Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of ſcripture come once to be
Queſtioned, it is impoſſible to bring men backe to an vnanimous, or any
well grounded reception and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of them, except by ſome authority
acknowledged to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; which if we deny, thoſe Books which are
receyved by many or moſt, may, as I ſayd, be doubted of even by thoſe
many, and they which were receyved by few, may in tyme gaine number and
authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and ſo all things concerning ſcripture, muſt be ſtill
ebbing, and flowing, and ſloating in irremediable and endless vncertainty, of
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and rejecting the Canonicall Books. And what connection, or tye, or

which makes this an Article of Faith is ſo asſiſted as not to propoſe
any thing as a Divine Truth which is not revealed by God? If they were
commended to the Church by the Apoſtles as Canonicall, low then is the 
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59214:169"/>Church an infallible keeper of the Canon of Scripture,
which hath ſuffered ſome Books of Canonicall Scripture to be loſt? And

necesſity of being ſo eſteemed, and afterward as it were by the Law of
Poſtliminium hath reſtored their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Canonicalbiess vnto them?
If this was delivered by the Apoſtles to the Church, the Poynt was
ſufficiently diſcuſſed, and therfore your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches omisſion to teach
it for ſome ages as an Article of Faith, nay degrading it from the Number of

ſome Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes haue bene loſt, and others loſt for a long tyme their being
Canonicall, or at leaſt the necesſity of being ſo eſteemed?</hi> I
anſwer: Your Argument is of no force againſt vs Catholiques, who belieue an
alwayes Living Guide, the Church of God, by which we ſhall infallibly be
directed in all Points belonging to Faith and Religion to the worldes end, as
occaſion ſhall require; yea we bring this for a Demonſtration, that the
Church muſt be infallible, and Judg of Controverſyes. There was no
ſcripture for about two thouſand yeares from Adam to Moyſes: And againe
for about two thouſand yeares more from Moyſes to Chriſt our Lord, holy
ſcripture was only among the people of Iſrae<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>l: and yet there were Gentils
in thoſe dayes indued with Divine Faith, as appeareth in Job, and his
friends. The Church alſo of our Saviour Chriſt, was before the ſcriptures
of the New Teſtament, which were not written inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor all at one
tyme, but ſucceſſively, and vpon ſeverall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſome
after the deceaſe of moſt of the Apoſtles; and after they were written,
they were not preſently knowne to all Churches: and as men could be ſaved
in thoſe tymes without ſcripture, ſo afterward alſo, vpon condition,
that we haue a Living Guide, and be ready to receiue ſcripture, when it
ſhall be propoſed to vs by that Guide But your Objection vrges moſt
againſt your brethren and yourſelf, who acknowledg no other Rule of Faith
but ſcripture alone, and yet teach, that the duty of the Church is to keepe
ſcripture, which being now your only Rule and neceſſary for Faith and
ſalvation, how doth ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge her duty, if ſhe hath <hi>ſuffered
ſome Bookes to be loſt? And others to looſe for a long tyme their being
Canonicall, at leaſt, the necesſity of <pb n="321" facs="tcp:59214:169"/>being ſo
eſteemed?</hi> Eſpecially ſeing you teach againſt other Proteſtants,
that we receyue ſcripture from the Authority of the Church alone, and therfor
if ſhe may faile either by propoſing falſe ſcriptures, or in
conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the true ones, Proteſtants want all meanes of ſalvation.
Neither can you anſwer, that it belongs to Gods Providence, not to permit
ſcripture to be wholly loſt, ſince it is neceſſary to ſalvation.
For you muſt remeber your owne Doctrinem; that God may permit true Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to be wrought, to delude men, in puniſhment of their ſins; and then why may
he not permit, either true ſcriptures to be loſt, or falſe ones to be
obtruded for true, in puniſhment of ſin, and particularly of the
exceſſiue pride of thoſe, who preferr their judgment before the Decrees
of Gods church, deny her Authority, allow no Rule but ſcripture, interpreted
by themſelves alone; that ſo their pride againſt the Church, and the
abuſe of true ſcripture may be juſtly puniſhed by ſubtraction of
true, or obtruſion of falſe Bookes? Beſide, God in his holy Providence
works by ſecond cauſes or Meanes. If then he permit ſome ſcriptures to
be loſt, and yet his Will be, that there remaine a way open to Heaven, he
will not faile to do it by other Meanes, which is, by the Magiſtery of other
men, (Faith comes by hearing) that is, by his Church, which he hath commanded
vs to heare; vnless you will haue all men pretend with Svvinckfeldians to be
guided by enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſmes, or extraordinary lights, motions, or rapts. And
ſo this very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, in permitting ſome ſcripture to be
loſt, or queſtioned for a tyme, proves the neceſſity of a Living Guide,
and the no-neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or no ſole-ſufficiency of ſcripture, and that
God hath permitted ſuch a loss or doubting, to teach vs the neceſſity and
ſufficiency of a viſible Living Guide.</p>

                     </gap>rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which hath ſuffered ſome bookes to be loſt?</hi> It
is eaſy for vs to anſwer; that the Church ſhall alwayes be infallibly
directed to performe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is neceſſary for ſalvation of men; and
if any bookes of ſcripture haue bene loſt, we are ſure the Church can,
and will, ſupply that defect, by the aſſiſtance which God hath
promiſed Her: as your Volkelius (de vera Relig: L. 6. C. 19.) affirmes, and
endeavours to prove, that by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone the Church may be reſtored,
though ſhe were ſuppoſed, total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue fayled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which conceit of
his, though it be but a meere chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, ſince it appeares by experience, that
ſcripture alone is not ſufficient to produce vnity in faith, nor can
inſtruct vs in all Points neceſſary to <pb n="322" facs="tcp:59214:170"/>be believed;
yet it demonſtrates, that if the Church be acknowledged to be infallible
ſhe may ſupply all want or loss of ſcripture, by the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, as ſhe did for yeares and Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſcripture was written. But this anſwer cannot ſerue Proteſtants, who on
the one ſide cannot be aſſured, that in thoſe ſcriptures which were
loſt, there were not contayned ſome fundamentall or neceſſary Points of
Faith; and on the other, are reſolved not to make vſe of the ineſtimable
benefit, which they might receyue by ſubmitting to Gods Church, and commit a
grievous ſin by rejecting her Authority: and ſo God giving moſt
ſufficient and certaine meanes, you remayne inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable for not making
vſe of them. Thus then the infallibility of Gods Church in being a keeper of
ſcripture, conſiſts not in this, that no ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be loſt which God
in his holy Providence ſupplyes by another Meanes, but that ſhe be ſo
directed, as no ſcripture, or other Meanes be loſt, if indeed they be
neceſſary for ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="54">54. What you ſay of the Churches reſtoring to ſome
books of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their authority, and Canonicallness, muſt be anſwered
by Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who receyue for Canonicall ſome books, of which once there
was ſome doubt; neither will they pretend, to reſtore to them authority or
Canonicallness, which in themſelves they could never looſe (for, what is
once written by inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, is for ever truly ſayd to
haue bene ſo written) but only we may come to know that which we did not
know, or to be aſſured of that wherof ſome doubted. Which yet you muſt
not ſo vnderſtand, as if the whole Church did ever doubt of thoſe bookes,
and much less that ſhe did deny, or ever could make any Declaration or
Definition that they were not Canonicall, but only that they having been once
commended to the Church by the Apoſtles, ſome particular perſons
afterward fell into ſome doubt concerning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as many haue queſtioned or
denyed divers Articles of Faith delivered to Chriſtians by the Apoſtles;
and the Church, in due tyme, even by occaſion of ſuch doubt or denyall,
declared, the Truths contrary to thoſe Hereſyes, to be arricles of Faith,
and thoſe books of which ſome doubted, to be Canonicall. Thus Potter (Pag:
216.) teaches, <hi>that the Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

(by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if emergent Hereſyes) in the other Catholique Creeds of Nice,
Conſeantmople, Epheſus, Chalcedon, and Athanaſius,</hi> contains all
fundamentall Points of Faith. And therfor you are injuriours to Gods Church in
ſaying; her <hi>omiſſion to teach for ſome ages</hi> as an Article of
Faith that ſuch books were <pb n="323" facs="tcp:59214:170"/>Canonicall, nay, degrading
them from the number of articles of Faith, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d putting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among diſputable
problemes was ſurely not very lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble For, the church did not omit to
declare in due tyme, and vpon fit or neceſſary occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they were
Canonicall, as the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Councell of Nice (of whoſe Creed your Church of
England (Art. 8.) ſaieth it ought throughly to be receaved, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d believed) by
occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable hereſy of Arius, with whom you and your Socinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
agree, declared that Chriſt was Conſubſtantiall to his Father. Neither
did the Church ever degrade from an article of Faith, or put among diſputable
problemes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y Part of true Canonicall ſcripture, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfor <hi>Cha:
Ma:</hi> ſayd truly, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that never a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y booke or ſyllable

Definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſufficiently notifyed; though Heretiks will ſtill be doing
what pride a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d obſtinacie may ſuggeſt. In the meane tyme, you will find,
that I haue already a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered what you object P. 142. N. 29 againſt the
ſayd affirmation of <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> that <hi>never any book or ſyllable
once defined</hi> &amp;c: and of which you are pleaſed to ſay;
<hi>certainly it is a bold aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but extremely falſe,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
ſay; Hee (<hi>Cha: Ma:) were beſt ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>b his forhead hard, and ſay,</hi> &amp;c: But our anſwer is
very obvious, that the booke of Eccleſias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus, and Wiſdome, the Epiſtle
of S. James, and to the Heb: (which you mention) were approved by the
Apoſtles for Canonicall: yet that did not hinder, but afterward ſome might
be ignorant, or doubt of them, as many did of divers principall articles
delivered by the Apoſtles, and then the church had reaſon and authority to
declare the matter. You cite S. Gregory (L 9. Morall: C. 13.) calling the books
of Machabees not Canonicall. S. Gregory hath no ſuch thing in the chapter
which you cite but (L. 19. C. 17.) which you might haue learned out of Potter,
who (P. 259.) cites the ſame authority as I haue ſet it downe. This I would
not haue noted, if you had not taxed your adverſary for miſſing a
citation in one place, wheras he citeth the ſame thing right in another as I
note herafter. Potter, I ſay, makes the ſame objection out of S. Gregory,
and <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> (Part. 2. Chap. 7. N. 18.) anſwers it at large, and you
cannot be excuſed in taking no notice therof, and yet make ſtill the ſame
Objection which Potter did. Theſe then be the words of <hi>Charity
Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned:</hi> what you alledg out of S. Gergory, is eaſily anſwered for
he doth not call the Machabees, not Canonicall, as if he would exclude them
from the number of true, and divine ſcriptures, but becauſe they were not
in the canon of the Jewes, or in that which he had at hand 
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59214:171"/>when he wrote his firſt draught of his commentaryes
vpon Job. For he was at that tyme the Popes Nuncius, or Legat at
Conſtantinople, and the Greek Rapſody. of African Canons had vntruly put
out of the Canon the two Bookes of the Machabees, though they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved in
Africa as Canonicall, by the Decree of the African Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. And therfor you
were ill adviſed, vnder colour of commending Pope Gregory, (but indeed the
more to impugne vs by his authority) to write Greg: M: or Magnus, the great,
wheras he was no Pope, but only Deacon, when he firſt wrote thoſe
commentaryes vpon Job. Thus farr <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="55">55. As for your demand: <hi>whether before Sixtus Quintus
his tyme our Church had a defined canon of ſcripture, or not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer: We had the ſame Canon then, which we haue novv,
and vvhich the ſacred councell of Trent hath ſet dovvne, (Sess: 4. decreto
de Canonicis ſcripturis.) The church had alvvayes the ſame Canon, that is,
ſhe never declared by any decree, any bookes to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall at one tyme,
vvhich ſhe admitted for Canonicall at another. One Councell may omitt or not
mention ſome booke vvhich another ſpecifyes, but can never declare it to be
Apocryphall, or not canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; to vvhich contrariety, only private perſons
are obnoxious. But yet although our church had not ſet do vvne the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
ſcripture, it is very improper for you to object; <hi>then was your Church
ſurely a moſt vigilant kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſcripture, that for</hi> (1500)
<hi>yeares had not defined what was ſcripture, and what was not.</hi> For, do
not Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts till this day disagree about the canon of ſcripture, and
ſo are not able to define vvhat is ſcripture, and what is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea
they poſitively deny ſome books to be ſcripture, vvhich others of them
affirme to be Canonicall. It is true, I cannot properly ſay, that, for (1500)
yeares they haue not defined any canon, becauſe they haue no ſuch ancient
being. But I muſt ſay; although they ſhould laſt (1500) millions of
yeares, they vvould never be able to ſet dovvne any certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne canon, as not
having any aſſured ground, for vvhich one part ſhould yield to another.
And ſtill I muſt be putting you in mynd of the difference betvveen
Catholiks and Proteſtants, that vve vvho believe the church to be infallibly
aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt, are ſure that ſhe cannot deceaue vs,
vvith falſe or Apocryphall ſcriptures, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude any falſe canon;
vvheras you, vvho rely vpon ſcripture alone, and yet can haue no certainty
vvhat is the true canon, (as appeares both by your mutuall disagreements, and
becauſe you haue no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <pb n="325" facs="tcp:59214:171"/>infallible meanes to
knovv vvhat is true ſcripture) can haue no ſecurity for your faith, in
regard you haue no certainty concerning the totall rule therof.</p>
               <p n="56">56. Your other Demand, (Whether our Canon of ſcripture
vvas that vvhich vvas ſet forth by Sixtus, or that ſet forth by Clement, or
a third, different from both?) If it be vvell conſidered, is, to ſpeake
truth, exoticall; for to the demand vvhat books be Canonicall, the direct and
right Anſvver is, that ſuch or ſuch books belong to the Canon of
ſcripture; for example, Geneſis, Exodus, Pſalmes, foure Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells,
&amp;c: vvhich Demand and Anſvver abſtract from that other queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
about different Tranſlations, and Editions. And vvho vvill aske, vvhether the
Septuagint, or Aquila, or Luther, Calvin, Beza, Caſtalio, ſet out a
different Canon of ſcripture, I meane, for thoſe bookes in which they agree
that they are Canonicall, and yet it is notorious that their Translations of
the ſame canon, or books of ſcripture, are moſt different? Or, if you
will haue theſe demands to be all one, ſeing both the Hebrew and Greeke
books are corrupted, as Calvin confeſſes, your anſwer to your owne Demand
muſt be, that no true canon of ſcripture can be found; and then woe be to
Proteſtants, whoſe Faith and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends vpon the true canon of
ſcripture. If your Demand be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Edition of Sixtus and Clement; I
Anſwer, They ſett forth no different canon, but the ſelfſame; to wit,
thoſe books which before their tyme made vp the canon of ſcripture. And, as
for the edition of Sixtus, it is no good dealing in you to doe in this, as you
did concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the words of S. Gregory, concealing the large and cleare
Anſwer which <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> gaue to the ſame objection (made by Potter)
(Part. 2. Chap. 6. N. 3.) where by the Authenticall Teſtimonyes of Perſons
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhewed that the Decree of Sixtus about, his edition,
was never promulgated; that he himſelf had declared diverſe things to haue
crept in, which needed a ſecond review; and that the whole work ſhould be
re-examined, which he could never do, being preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by death.</p>
               <p n="57">57. But good Sr. Reflect I beſeech you, that in this,
and the like Demands, you give deadly wounds to Proteſtants, who profess to
rely vpon ſcripture alone, and yet cannot poſſibly haue any certainty
what ſcripture is true or corrupted, by the Hebrew or Greek Texts, which they
acknowledg to be corrupted, and much less by Tranſlations of Proteſtants,
who bitterly accuſe one another of moſt grievous errours 
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59214:172"/>in their Tranſlations, as <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> hath
ſhewed (Part. 1. Chap. 2. N. 16.) which I wiſh the Reader, for the Eternall
good of his ſoule, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, and reflect, that if ſcripture be the only
Rule of his Faith, and yet he either is ſure that ſome Texts therof are
corrupted, or at leaſt not ſure but that they are ſo, he cannot be
obliged to belieue any one Text, nor can in Matters of Eternity rely theron: as
in caſe divers meates were ſet before me, wherof I know ſome to be
poyſonous, and I haue no meanes to diſcerne them from the other, I cannot
ſafely touch any one of them. But the matter paſſes in a far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
manner with vs Catholiks, as I haue often ſayd, and muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeate: We
being ſure that the church can neither approue any leaſt corruption, nor
ground vpon it any Point of Faith: and ſo a corruption in a true booke of
Scripture, can no more hurt vs, then falſe Scriptures or Goſpells which
were vented in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive church, could prejudice thoſe Chriſtians.
Nevertheless, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, as I ſayd, the church cannot approue any falſe
tranſlation, yet ſhe is not obliged at all tymes to declare one for
Authenticall, till all circumſtances conſidered, there appeare ſome
neceſſity ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; as the ſacred Councell of Trent did, by occaſion of
a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of pernicious Tranſlations, publiſhed by moderne Heretiks in
favour of theyr hereſies; and for other juſt cauſes. Luther himſelf
Lib: contra Zwing: de verit Corporis Chriſti in Euchar:) was at length
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oed to confess, that, <hi>If the world laſt longer, it will be againe
neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Decrees of Councells, and to haue recourſe to
them, by reaſon of divers interpretations of ſcripture which now
raigne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="58">58. To that which you ſay in the ſame (N. 29.)
<hi>ſuppoſe it had bene true, that never any Booke after reteyving had bene
Questioned, how had this bene a ſigne that the Church is infallibly
aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt? In what moode or figure would this
Concluſion follow out of theſe Premiſes? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your flying to ſuch
poore ſignes, as theſe are, is to me a great ſigne, that you labour with
penury of better Arguments: and that, thus to catch at ſhaddowes and
bulruſhes, is a ſhrewd ſigne of a ſinking cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="59">59. Anſwer What greater ſigne of particular
Aſſiſtance, and as it were a Determination to Truth from ſome higher
cauſe, than conſent and conſtancy of many therin, while we ſee others
change, alter, and contradict one another (and even the ſame man become
contrary to himſelf) who yet in all other humane reſpects haue the 
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59214:172"/>ſame occaſion, ability, and reaſon, of ſuch
conſent and conſtancy? Tertullian, (Praeſcript: Chap: 28.) ſaith truly:

<q rend="margQuotes">Among many events there is not one
iſſue, the errour of the churches muſt needs haue varied.</q> But that
which among many is found to be one, is not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, but delivered. And the
experience we haue of the many, great, and endless differences of Proteſtants
about the canon of ſcripture, and interpretation therof, is a very great
argument, that the church, which never alters nor diſagrees from herſelf,
is guided by a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, infallible, Divine Spirit; as Chriſtians among
other induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to belieue that ſcripture is the word of God, alledg the
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect coherence of one part therof with another.</p>
               <p n="60">60. Before I paſſe to your next Errour; I muſt aske
a Queſtion about what you deliver (Pag: 141. N. 28.) where, ſpeaking of
ſome Bookes of ſcripture, you ſay; <hi>Seeing after the Apoſtles the
Church pretends to no new Revelations, how can it be an Article of Faith to
believe them Canoncall?</hi> And (Pag: 142. N. 29.) If <hi>they</hi> (ſome
certaine bookes of ſcripture) <hi>were approved by the Apoſtles, this I
hope was a ſufficient definition;</hi> How, I ſay, you who hold that,
Scripture is not a Point of Faith, nor revealed by God, can ſay, that to
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe bookes of ſcripture, though they had bene propoſed before, is to
propoſe new Revelations or Definitions of the Apoſtles: But, as I ſayd
hertofore, it is no newes for you to vtter contradictions.</p>
               <p n="61">61. A ſeventh Errour plainly deſtructiue both of
ſcripture, and all Chriſtianity, is taken out of your Doctrine (of which I
haue ſpoken hertofore) that the Bible was proved to be Divine, by thoſe
Miracles which were wrought by our Saviour Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and yet
that God may permit true Miracles to be wrought to delude men. Which
Aſſertions put togeather, may giue occaſion to doubt, whether thoſe
Miracles, wherby the Scriptute was confirmed, were not to delude men; and ſo
we can haue no certainty that Scripture is the word of God.</p>
               <p n="62">62. To this I will add a Doctrine of yours delivered
(Pag: 69. N. 47.) which overthrowes all proof that can be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from Miracles,
for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation either that ſcripture is the word of God, or that other
articles of Chriſtian Faith are true. Thus you write: <hi>For my part I
profess, if the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the ſcripture were not as good, and as ſit to
come from the fountaine of goodness, as the Miracles by which it was confirmed,
were great, I ſhould <pb n="328" facs="tcp:59214:173"/>want one maine pillar for my
Faith, and for want of it, I feare ſhould be much ſtaggered in it.</hi>
Doth not this aſſertion declare, that true Miracles are in ſufficient of
themſelves, to convince that a thing confirmed by them, is true, or good,
vnless men do alſo interpoſe their owne judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the things in
themſelves are ſuch? which is not to belieue the Miracles, or God
ſpeaking and teſtifying by them, but to ſubject the Teſtimony of God to
the judgment of men? wheras, contrarily, we ought to judge ſuch things to be
good, becauſe they are ſo teſtifyed, and not belieue, that Teſtimony to
be true, becauſe in our judgment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently of that Teſtimony, the
things are good in themſelves; which were to vary our belief of Gods
Teſtimony, according as we may chance to alter our judgment at different
tymes, and vpon divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which may preſent themſelves to our
vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. Do not you in divers places pretend, that this reaſon is
aboue all other? God ſayes ſo, therfor it is true: and further do you not
ſay? (Pag. 144. N. 31.) <hi>If you be ſo infallible, as the Apoſtles
were, ſhew it as the Apoſtles did. They went forth (ſayes S. Mark) and
preached every where, the Lord working with them and confirming their words
with ſignes following. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posſible, that God ſhould ly: and that
the Eternall Truth ſhould ſet his hand and ſeale to the confirmation of a
falſhood, or of ſuch Doctrine, as is partly true and partly falſe. The
Apoſtles Doctrine was thus confirmed, therfor it was intirely true, and in no
part either falſe or vncertaine.</hi> If the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God be with you
aboue all reaſon, and that by ſignes or Miracles the <hi>Eternall Truth
ſets his hand and ſeale to the confirmation of</hi> what is ſo confirmed;
how comes it, that your Faith could be ſtaggered (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the
working of ſuch Miracles) if in your judgment the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the
ſcripture were not as good, as the Miracles by which it was confirmed, were
great? Or what could it availe vs to proue our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine by Miracles, as the
Apoſtles did, if the belief of thoſe Points ſo proved, muſt ſtand to
the mercy of your judgment, which as I ſaied, may vary vpon divers
occaſions: and yet this diverſity of judgment you muſt, according to this
your doctrine, follow, even againſt any point, though confirmed by Miracle.
It is therfor cleare; That in your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, you can haue no certainty of
the truth of ſcripture, nor of the contents threrof, although it were
ſuppoſed, that it alone did expreſſly and inparticular containe all
Points neceſſary to be believed.</p>
               <p n="63">63. Your 8. Errour conſiſts in this: that, beſide
what I haue ſayd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in your ſecond and third Errour (that you impeach
the certainty <pb n="329" facs="tcp:59214:173"/>of ſcripture, by taking away vniverſall
infallibility from the Apoſtles who wrote it, and for whoſe Authority we
belieue it.) I find you do the ſame in other places. You ſay (P. 144. N.
30.) <hi>The infallibility of the Church depends vpon the infallibility of the
Apoſtles, and beſides, this depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is voluntary, for it is in the
power of the Church to deviate from this Rule, being nothing elſe but an
aggregation of men, of which every one has free will, and is ſubject to
paſſions and errour.</hi> Change the tearmes, and ſay: <hi>The
infallibility of the Apoſtles depended
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pon the infallibility</hi>
of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>and this dependance was voluntary; for it was in the power
of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to deviate from this Rule,</hi> being nothing but a number
of men, of whom every <hi>one has freewill, and is ſubject to paſſion and
errour;</hi> and that we way be ſure of this laſt, in the very next (N.
31.) you teach, <hi>That the Apoſtles themſelves, even after the ſending
of the Holy Ghoſt, were, and through inadvertence or prejudice (a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> P.
137. N. 21.) to <hi>tinadvertence or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,</hi> you add, <hi>or ſome
other cauſe,</hi> (which gives ſcope, enough to cenſure the Apoſtles)
<hi>continued for a tyme in an errour repugnant to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truth
notwitſtanding our Saviours express warrant and injunction to goe and preach
to all Nations.</hi> Chriſt then, according to you, did not depriue the
Apoſtles of freewill, though he propoſed externally the Object, and gaue
them ſufficient Grace to performe his will. For if he had mooved them to
Truth by way of neceſſity, they could not haue erred: If you grant this,
what will follow, but that as the Church, ſo the Apoſtles might deviate
from that which God declared and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and conſequently either belieue
amiss, or not ſet downe faithfully in writing, what they believed? Which is
alſo confirmed by what you write (P. 86. N. 93.) <hi>If it were true that God
had promiſed to aſſiſt you, for the delivering of true Scripture would
this oblige Him, or would it follow from hence that he had obliged himſelf,
to teach you, not only ſufficiently, but effectually, and irreſiſtibly
the true ſenſe of ſcripture?</hi> And a little after; <hi>God is not
laviſh in ſuperfluityes, and therfor having given vs meanes ſufficient
for our direction, and power ſufficient to make, vſe of theſe meanes, he
will not conſtraine or neceſſitate vs to make vſ of theſe meanes.
For, that were to croſſe the end of our Creation, which was to be glorifyed
by our free Obedience: Wheras neceſſity and freedom connot ſtand
togeather.</hi> And afterward: <hi>If God ſhould worke in vs by an abſolute

cannot <hi>neceſſitate men to belieue aright, without taking away their
free will in believing and in profeſſing their belief.</hi> It ſeemes by
theſe words, you hold the Apoſtles to haue had freewill in believing,
prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and writing, and that therfor it was in their power to deviate from
Gods will and motion: and then, according to your grounds, as the church, ſo
alſo the Apoſtles might erre. Which deduction is alſo proved by your
words (Pag: 172. N. 71.) <hi>The ſpirit of truth may be with a man or Church
for ever, and teach him all Truth,</hi> and yet he <hi>may fall into ſome
errour; even contrary to the truth, which is taught him only ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently,
and not irreſiſtibly, ſo that he may learne it, if he will, not ſo that
he muſt and ſhall, whether he will or no. Now, who can aſſertaine me,
that the ſpirits teaching is not of this nature? Or how can you poſſibly
reconcile it, with your Doctrine of freewill in believing, if it be not of this
nature?</hi> Now, if you do not depriue the Apoſtles of freewill, becauſe
otherwiſe God could no more require of them as their duty to belieue, preach,
and write ſuch truths as were inſpired by Him, than he can <hi>of the ſun
to ſhine, of the ſea to ebb and flow,</hi> &amp;c: this diſcourſe of
yours takes away their infallibility, and proves that they might fall into
ſome errour even contrary to the truth which was taught or revealed to them,
and the contrary aſſertion cannot poſſibly be reconciled with their
freewill. And Pag: 87. N. 95. you ſay; <hi>If the Holy Ghoſts moving the
Church be reſiſtible, then the Holy Ghoſt may moue, and the Church may
not be moved.</hi> And why do you not ſay, if the Holy Ghoſts moving the
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to belieue, preach, and write Scripture be reſiſtible, it
muſt in the ſame manner follow, that the Holy Ghoſt may move, and the
Apoſtles may not be moved, and ſo may belieue, preach, and write
errours.</p>
               <p n="64">64. But this is not all the bitterness you Vent againſt
the church, in ſuch manner, as it wounds the Apoſtles, no less than the
church. You ſay (P. 86. N, 93. and P. 87. N. 94.) <hi>If you Church be

ſheenot forth Infallible Commentaryes or Fxpoſitions vpon all the Bible? Is
it becauſe this would not be profitable for Chriſtians, that Scripture
ſhould be interpreted? It is blaſphemous to ſay ſo. The ſcripture
itſelf tells vs, all ſcripture is profitable. And the ſcripture is not
ſo much the words <pb n="331" facs="tcp:59214:174"/>as the ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="65">65. In anſwer to this your weake and irreligious
diſcourſe, I returne the like Demands, whether the Apoſtles were
infallibly directed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true meaning or interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
ſcripture, as they were for writing it? I ſuppoſe you will ſay, they
were ſo directed. Why then did they put their candle vnder a buſhell, and
keepe their Talent of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Scripture infallibly, wrapt vp in napkins?
Why did they not ſet forth infallible commentaryes, or expoſitions vpon all
the bible? Was it becauſe this would not haue bene profitable for
Chriſtians, that ſcripture ſhould be interpreted? It is blaſphemous to
ſay ſo. The Scripture itſelf tells vs, all ſcripture is profitable. And
ſcripture is not ſo much the words, as the ſence. And when you haue made
theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands againſt the Apoſtles, you may in like manner aſcend
higher, and aske, why divers parts of ſcripture were ſo written, as they
not only need expoſitions, but that no mortall man can vnderſtand them?
When you haue given a ſatisfactory anſwer to theſe Demands, the ſame
will anſwer your Queſtions concerning the church, which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by
the Holy Ghoſt, will not faile to interpret, declare, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all that
is neceſſary in order to the Eternall ſalvation of ſoules, and in
particular will ſupply by Tradition, or other Meanes, what is obſcure, or
is not contayned in Scripture. But then you aske againe (N. 95.) Whether this
Direction of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>be reſiſtible by the Church, or
irreſiſtible?</hi> I ſtill anſwer by demanding, whether the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
the Holy Ghoſt was reſiſtible by the Apoſtles, or irreſiſtible? If
irreſiſtible; why may we not ſay the ſame of the church for thoſe
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Actions of Interpreting Scripture, and Deciding controverſyes in
Religion? If reſiſtible; then either we are not ſure that the Apoſtles
did not deviate from the Motion of the holy Ghoſt, as you infer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> againſt the infallibility of
the church; or els we learne by this example of the Apoſtles, that God may
moue reſiſtibly, and yet infallibly for attainng that End, which by meanes
of ſuch a Motion he intends. This if you be reſolved to deny, we muſt
conclude, that the Apoſtles were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in their writings, and that
we can haue no certainty, that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not containe errours. But
whatſoever you thinke, the truth is, that God wants not power to moue men
reſiſtibly, and yet infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, by divers wayes knowen to his infinite
Wiſdome. I would gladly know, whether you belieue, that God can poſſibly
be ſure to make any one a Saint, or a repentant ſinner, or can promiſe
perſeverance to the <pb n="332" facs="tcp:59214:175"/>end. I ſuppoſe you will not
deny but that he can: and then ſeing one cannot be a Saint, or a converted
ſinner, or perſever to the end, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by free Actions of the will,
proceeding from Grace, you muſt grant, that the congruous and efficacious
Grace of God, may conſiſt both with freedome of our will, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d infallibility
in Gods fore-ſight. I ſayd, that if freewill in the Church cannot ſtand
with infallibility, neither could it conſiſt with infallibility in the
Apoſtles. Now I add: your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments proue not only againſt the fallibility
of the Church and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but alſo of Chriſt our Lord, in your wicked
doctrine, that he is not God, nor Conſubſtantiall to his Father, but only
man; and then your demands enter; whether he were moved by his Father
reſiſtibly, or irreſiſtibly? And the ſame anſwer you giue for Him,
muſt be given for his Apoſtles, and his Church. You ſay (Pag: 86. N. 63.)
<hi>God gaue the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the guidance of this ſtarr: that was left to their liberty.</hi> But this

moved thoſe Wiſemen as he was ſure they would follow the ſtarr, and
performe that for which he preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted it to their eyes, and gaue light to
their vnderſtandings, and efficacy to their wills; that ſo our Saviour
Chriſt might be preached to the Gentils, by their meanes, as S. Leo (ſerm:

Councell of Trent; which I haue ſhewed might be done both freely, and yet
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the infallible fore-knowledg and Motion of the Holy Ghoſt. And
what you ſay of the Pope, may be applyed againſt the Apoſtles and other
Canonicall Writters, why they did delay ſo long to write Scripture, and
whether they were moved to it reſiſtibly, or irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly &amp;c.?</p>
               <p n="67">67. I conclude, that togeather with the Church, you
impugne the infallibility of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and conſequently of
their Writings, which forces me to repeat, that, according to your Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
ſcripture cannot be any Rule of Divine Faith, and much less a 
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59214:175"/>ſufficient Rule, though it were ſuppoſed to
contayne all neceſſary Points of Faith.</p>
               <p n="68">68. Your 9. and moſt capitall Errour remaynes; wherby
you depriue ſcripture of certainty and infallibility, and make both it and
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it, leſſe credible, than the Books of prophane Authours,
and things related in them: I meane your Aſſertion, that we know Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be the word of God, not by an infallible private Spirit, or by vndoubted
criteria, or ſignes appearing in Scripture it ſelf, as ſome other
Proteſtants teach; nor by the Church as infallibly aſſiſted by the
Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, according to the Doctrine of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes: but
from the Tradition of all Churches, meerly as they are an Aggregation of men
ſubject to Errour, and as their conſent is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to vs by Hiſtory and
humane Tradition. The private Spirit (which muſt be tryed by Scripture, and
not Scripture by it) and thoſe pretended manifeſt ſignes found in
Scripture it ſelf, are mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re fopperyes, confuted, by the experience of ſo
many learned men, who hertofore haue differed, and of Proteſtants, who at
this day differ about the Canon of Scripture; and this forceth you to ſay to
your Adverſary (Pag: 69. N. 46.) <hi>That the divinity of a writing cannot be

wheras Proteſtants teach, that the Church is only an inducement, and not the
certaine ground, for which we belieue Scripture, you in oppoſition to them,
affirme that thoſe criteria or ſignes are only Inducements; but that the
ground to receyve Scripture, is the Church, in the manner I haue declared. Out
of theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, you chooſe rather to be ſacrilegious, then
ſeeme to be ſimple, or no wiſe man; and therfor teach that Chriſtian
Faith is not infallibly true, but only probable: Which being a doctrine
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by other Proteſtants, and by all, reſpectiyely, who profess any
Religion, and Worſhipp of God, it followes that we muſt receyue Scripture
from the Church of God, acknowledged to be infallible. This being once granted,
we muſt further ſay, that Her infallibility is vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall in all things
concering matters of Faith and Religion: neither is it poſſible to bring
ſome other infallible Authority, to proue the Church infallible in this Point
alone. For, to omitt other Reaſons, you muſt proue that Authority, by
ſome other, and ſo without end. In the meane tyme, we haue reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
bless our good God, who hath forced Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, at <pb n="334" facs="tcp:59214:176"/>length to ſee the foolery of a private ſpirit, and the vanity of
manifeſt ſignes pretended to be found evidently in ſcripture; and ſo
come either to acknowledg the infallibility of Gods church, or with Atheiſts
and enemyes of Chriſtian Religion, to deny the infallibility of Chriſtian
Faith, by ſetling the truth therof vpon humane fallible tradition, which
ſay you (Pag. 72. N. 51.) <hi>is a principle not in Chriſtianity but in
Reaſon, nor proper to Chriſtians, but common to all men.</hi> And (Pag 53.
N. 3.) you te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, that ſcripture may be judge of all controverſyes,
<hi>thoſe only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wherin the Scripture itſelf is the ſubject of
the Queſtion, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be determined but by naturall Reaſon, the only
Principle beſide ſcripture, which is common to Chriſtians.</hi> Behold
the Analyſis or Reſolution of Chriſtian Faith into humane fallible,
naturall Reaſon! But now let vs ſhew the falſhood of this your
Errour.</p>
               <p n="69">69. Firſt, it is an argument of no ſmall waight, that
both in this deviſe itſelf you contradict all Catholikes and Proteſtants,
and in the conſequence which inavoidably followes it, namely, that the
aſſent of Chriſtian Faith is fallible; wherin, as I ſayd, you
contradict all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and all men who profess any Religion.</p>
               <p n="70">70. 2. Chriſtian Faith is infallible as I haue proved;
which it could not be, if the ground on which it relyes were fallible.</p>
               <p n="71">71. 3. It hath bene proved that Chriſtian Faith is the
Gift of God, and in all occaſions requires the ſupernaturall influence of
the Holy Ghoſt, which yet could not be neceſſary, if Faith were but a
fallible concluſion, evidently deduced from a Principle not in
Chriſtianity, but in naturall reaſon, as we haue heard you profess, and
vpon that ground affirme, that Chriſtian Faith is only probable, not
rayſing our Vnderſtanding aboue the probability of humane inducements:
wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it differs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the judicium credibilitatis of which Catholike Divines
ſpeake, and by which practicè and effectually we judg the Articles of
Chriſtian Faith, to deſerue, and require of vs, vnder payne of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a moſt certaine infallible belief, beyond all precedent Motives of
credibility, which judgment being the beginning of ſupernaturall Faith, and
of it ſelf an Act of great difficulty to humane Reaſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a
particular aſſiſtance of Divine Grace.</p>
               <p n="72">72. 4. If we receyue Scripture vpon this your fallible
Tradition, we ſhall haue greater certainty of the Bookes of prophane
Authours, that they were written by ſuch men, than that the Books of
Scripture, were written by thoſe whom we belieue to haue written them;
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <pb n="335" facs="tcp:59214:176"/>the Tradition is more full for thoſe, than
for theſe, as I ſayd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue; as alſo there are many works of thoſe men,
which never any Chriſtian or other called in queſtion, wheras ſcarcely
any Book of Scripture hath not bene queſtioned, even by Chriſtians; as they
are deſpiſed and denyed by all the enemyes of Chriſtian Religion. It will
alſo follow, for the like reaſon, that we are more certaine that there was
ſuch a man as Henry the eight King of England, Coeſar, Pompey &amp;c. Then
that there was ſuch a man as Jeſus Chriſt, as I haue ſhewed already:
and yet what Chriſtian can heare ſuch blaſphemyes, without juſt
indignation, and horrour?</p>
               <p n="73">73. 5. Proteſtants are wont to object, that we giue
greater credit to men, than to the word of God; becauſe we belieue the
ſcripture for the authority of Gods church. This is of no force againſt vs,
who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the church to be infallibly aſſiſted, and inſpired by the
Holy Ghoſt, and that God ſpeakes by the church, and conſequently that the
voyce of the church is the voice of God; and ſo we belieue the word of God,
for the authority and Teſtimony of God; as all muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the
Primitiue of Chriſtians, to haue receyved and believed the Scriptures, vpon
the authority of the Apoſtles, who yet were men, but men inſpired and
infallibly directed by the Holy Ghoſt. But the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection turned againſt
you, is vnanſwerable; becauſe you ground the belief of ſcripture, and all
the contents therof, vpon men, expreſſly as they are fallible, and
ſubject to Errour, whoſe words you muſt belieue more than the word of
God, according to your owne Rule, (Pag. 377. N. 59.) <hi>we muſt be ſurerof
the Proofe, than of the thing proved, otherwiſe it is no Proofe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="74">74. This Argument I confirme by your words (Pag. 143. N.
30.) <hi>There is not the ſame reaſon for the Churches abſolute
infallibility, as for the Apoſtles and Scriptures. For, if the church fall
into Errour, it may be reformed by comparing it with the rule of the Apoſtles
Doctrine and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But if the Apoſtles haue erred in delivering the
Doctrine of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to whom ſhall we haue recourſe, for the
diſcovering and correcting their errour? Againe, there is not ſo much
ſtrength required in the Edifice as in the Foundation: and if but wiſe men
haue the ordering of the building, they will make it much a ſurer thing, that
the Foundation ſhall not fail the building, then that the building ſhall
not fall from the Foundation. Now the Apoſtles and Prophets, and Canonicall
writers are the foundation of the Church; therfor their ſtability in Reaſon
ought to be greater then the <pb n="336" facs="tcp:59214:177"/>Churches, which is built
vpon them. Again, a dependent infallibility cannot be ſo certaine as that on
which it depends: But the infallibility of the Church depends vpon the
infallibility of the Apoſtles, as the ſtreightness of the thing regulated,
vpon the ſtreigness of the Rule. Therfor the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is not
ſo certaine as that of the Apoſtles.</hi> This is your diſcourſe, which
I pray you apply to our preſent purpoſe, in this manner. There is not the
ſame reaſon for the Scriptures infallibility, as for Tradition. For, if
ſome Apocryphall Scripture be obtruded for Canonicall, it may be reformed by
comparing it with vniverſall Tradition; But if vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Tradition hath
erred in delivering the Canon of Scripture, to whom or to what, ſhall we haue
recourſe for the diſcovering, and correcting that errour of propoſing
Apocryphall Scripture? Againe, if but wiſe men haue the ordering of a
building, they will make it a much ſurer thing, that the Foundation ſhall
not faile the building, then that the building ſhall not fall from the
foundation. Now, vniverſall Tradition of men ſubject to errour, is to you
the Foundation of Scripture; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for their authority in (your) reaſon ought
to be greater then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is built vpon them. Againe a dependent
infallibility can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo certaine, as that on which it depends; But the
infallibility of Scripture, depends vpon the infallibility of vniverſall
Tradition of men: Therfor the Scriptures infallibility is not ſo certaine as
that of the Tradition of men; that is, neither the one, nor the other is
certaine. What ſay you to this application, and to your Doctrine which forces
vs to make it? But this application reſts not here. For, as you haue told vs,
that the infallibility of the Apoſtles muſt be greater then that of the
Church; ſo for the ſame reaſons, the infallibility of the Church muſt
be, to vs, greater then that of the Apoſtles, yea of Chriſt himſelf,
ſeing you belieue the Apoſtles and our Saviour Chriſt to haue bene
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and to haue proved their infallibility with Miracles, only by your
vniverſall Tradition of the Church, which therfor is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on which
your belief concerning the Apoſtles and our Saviour, depends; and
conſequently their infallibility is not ſo certaine to you, as the fallible
Tradition of men. For, we muſt examine and meaſure our knwledg of the words
and workes of the Apoſtles, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, by Tradition, and not Tradition
by them, becauſe Tradition to you is a Principle in nature, and precedent to
our belief of Chriſt; the Apoſtles; and Scripture, which depend on it as
the ſtreightness of the thing regulated, vpon the ſtreightness of the
Rule.</p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:59214:177"/>
               <p n="75">75. 6. Before we belieue Scripture, in your way, there is
no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple but Reaſon, placed between Motives (which you confess make it
only probable, that Scripture is the Word of God) and Arguments, which ſeeme
very ſtrong and convincing, that the Myſteries contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture, are
contrary to the ſayd only Principle, Reaſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the difficultyes,
which to the ſame Reaſon ſeeme great and inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable, in anſwering
ſeeming contradictions of Scripture to it ſelf; which are ſo many, and
ſo intricate, as certainly they will appeare to any judicious Man,
vnanſwerable, without ſubmiſſion to ſome infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authority, as a
ſupport for humane Reaſon againſt the ſtrength of them; as appeares by
the great paynes taken by learned men, and the difference of wayes in
ſatisfying ſuch difficultyes; and finally by a true confeſſion, that
when they haue done their vttermoſt, the laſt and beſt refuge is to
captivate their vnderſtanding to the Obedience of Faith; and one thing is
moſt certaine and evident, that Proteſtants reject di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Bookes of
Scripture receyved by Catholikes for Canonicall, vpon incomparably less
ſeeming difficultyes, or contradictions, and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, then are found in
thoſe Bookes of Scripture, which both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes and Proteſtants admit:
Now (ſay I) in this caſe, what ſhall Reaſon doe, being left to
itſelf, without any Authority beſide itſelf? The Motives and humane
Teſtimonyes of your tradition produced in favour of Chriſtianity, are only
probable, as you affirme; Arguments to the contrary, ſeeme convincing, and
ſuch as haue bene held for Principles, among the beſt Philoſophers, as I
ſhewed vpon another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and therfor Chriſtian Religion is
accounted fooliſhness to the Gentils; (and we treate of the tyme before one
is a Chriſtian) who the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will oblige ſuch a Man, being in
poſſeſſion of his Liberty, to accept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of damnation, an
obligation poſitively to belieue, and to liue according to the Rules of
Chriſtian Faith, only vpon fallible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, in oppoſition to ſo
great ſeeming evidence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?</p>
               <p n="76">76. Neither can you, in your grounds, ſay, that
Miracles wrought in confirmation of Chriſtian Religion, ought to be prevalent
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſeeming evidence of reaſon. For, you teach, that true
Miracles may be wrought to delude men; for avoyding of which delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it
may ſeeme wiſdome, and ſafeſt, to ſticke cloſe to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Reaſon, wherby though he may chance to be deceyved, yet he cannot be
accounted raſh, imprudent, or inexcuſable. 2. you muſt 
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59214:178"/>ſuppoſe, that Miracles and all other Motives end in
probability alone (for, if they ſurpass probability, you grant Chriſtian
Faith to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible) and then the difficulty ſtill remaynes; how one can
be obliged to imbrace meere probabilityes, and ſuch, as you confess are not
able to rayſe our mynd to a higher and more firme aſſent than they

evidence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon oppoſed only by ſuch probabilityes. 3. This Anſwer
is not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to our preſent Queſtion, which is not to treate, how farr
one may be obliged by Miracles, either evident by ſenſe, to thoſe who
ſee them wrought, or aſſerted and delivered, by an authority, believed to
be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as we Catholikes belieue Gods church to be: but we ſpeak of
Miracles, wrought in great diſtance of tyme and place from vs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and
believed only by your fallible tradition, which therfor lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves this doubt,
whether one can be obliged to preferr fallible hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tradition,
confeſſedly inſufficient to cauſe a certaine aſſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeeming evidence and certainty of naturall Reaſon. And it ſeemes eaſy
to demonſtrate that Proteſtants, if they will be conſtant to their owne
aſſertions and proceedings, muſt yield to that ſeeming evidence of
Reaſon. For, it cannot be denyed without great obſtinacy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency,
that in all ages there haue bene wrought frequent, great, and evident Miracles,
by the profeſſours of the Catholique Religion; recorded by men, eminent for
learning, wiſdome, and Sanctity, who would be credited in whatſoever caſe
or cauſe of higheſt concernment, and teſtifyed not by one, or a few, or
many ſingle perſons, but by whole Communityes, Cittyes, and Countryes: by
meanes of which Miracles, Infidels haue beene, and are at this day converted
from the worſhip of Idols, to know the true God, and whom he hath ſent,
Jeſus Chriſt: and yet notwithſtanding all theſe Miracles, which are
able to convert Pagans, Proteſtants will not conceiue themſelves obliged to
belieue, that ſuch Miracles were wrought, or that thoſe Articles of our
Faith, in confirmation wherof they were wrought, are true. And why? Becauſe
they ſeeme contrary to naturall Reaſon; as the Reall Preſence,
Tranſubſtantiation &amp;c: Seing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they reject Catholique Doctrines,
confirmed by Miracles, in regard of that ſeeming contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Reaſon,
how can they pretend Reaſon, to receaue Scripture, and the contents therof;
for example the Miſteryes of the B. Trinity, the Incarnation of the Son of
God, the Creation of all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the Reſurrection of the
Dead, and other ſuch Articles which <pb n="339" facs="tcp:59214:178"/>they make ſhew to
belieue, and are no less, yea much more ſeeming contrary to reaſon then
thoſe doctrines of Catholikes which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? Wherfor, our finall
Concluſion muſt be, that to deny an infallible Authority both to propoſe
Scripture and deliver infallible Traditions, is to vndermine and ouerthrow
Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="77">77. 7. Since Scripture may be corrupted, (as ſome haue
bene loſt) and in particular Proteſtants affirme, even the Vulgate
Tranſlation, which anciently was vſed in the Church, to be corrupted, as
alſo the Greek and Hebrew, your Tradition cannot ſecure vs, what in
particular is, or is not corruted, becauſe it delivers only as it were in
gross, ſuch or ſuch Bookes, but cannot with certainty informe vs of all
corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,, additions, varietyes, and alterations, as occaſion ſhall
require. Thus, ſome, both Catholikes and Proteſtanis teach, that Additions
haue been made even to Pentateuch; others aſſirme the ſame of the Bookes
of Joſue, Kings, and Hieremy; and the like Additions might, and perhaps haue
been made to other Bookes, at leaſt we cannot be ſure of the contrary, if
we conſult only your fallible Tradition; neither can we know by it, that
ſuch Additions proceeded from the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt. And as
Proteſtants are wont to ſay, that a very gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at number of Catholique
Doctrines (which they vntruly call errours) crept in by little and little (as
you alſo ſay Pag: 91. N. 101.) ſo what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty can they haue, that
corruptions in Scriptures, yea whole A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriphall Bookes, may not in tyme haue
gained the repute of being Canonicall? As for corruptions in Scripture, you
ſpeak dangerouſly in ſaying (Pag: 141. N. 27.) <hi>As for the
infallibility of the Church it is ſo farr from being a proof of the
Scriptures incorruption, that no proof can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for it, but
incorrupted places of Scripture: which yet are as ſubject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption as
any other, and more likly to haue bene corrupted (if it had bene posſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
then any other, and made to ſpeake as they do, for the advantage of thoſe
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it hath bene a long tyme, to bring all vnder their
authority.</hi> And afterward: <hi>I would aske, how ſhall I be aſſured,
that the Scriptures are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in theſe pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es</hi> (which arealledged to
proue the infallibility of the Church?) <hi>ſeing it is posſible, and not
altogeather improbable, that theſe men, which deſire to be thought
infallible, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had the government of all things in their owne hands, may
haue altered them for their purpoſe.</hi> Do not theſe words giue ſcope
for the enemyes of Chriſtian Religion, to object that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certaine
of any Text of Scripture, whether or no it be incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? For, as you ſay,
it is not altogeather improbable, that we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <pb n="340" facs="tcp:59214:179"/>ſome places for our purpoſe, of proving the infallibility of the
Church; ſo you may ſay, we haue done the ſame in other places to prove
other Points of our belief: and the like may be ſayd of all others, who teach
different Doctrines; that they will incline to corrupt Scripture, in favour of
their ſeverall Sects. Neither can we haue any certainty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this which
may be done, hath not bene practiſed, and ſo all comes to be vncertaine,
vnless we admit ſome infallible Living guide.</p>
               <p n="78">78. But here I muſt reflect how apt you are in every
occaſion to write contradictoryes. You ſay of the places of Scripture,
wherby we proue the in fallibility of the Church, that they <hi>are as
ſubject to corruption as any other, and more likly to haue bene corrupted (if
it had bene posſible) then any other, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of thoſe men whoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition it hath bene a long tyme, to bring all vnder
their authority.</hi> You ſay, that thoſe places are more likly to haue
bene corrupted if it had bene poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; which ſignifyes, that it was not
poſſible: and yet a few lines after, you affirme that it is poſſible,
and not altogeather improbable, that we haue done it. Is the ſame thing not
poſſible, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d poſſible, or, not poſſible a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet not improbable?
Beſide, you ſay, it is more likly thoſe places which we alledg for the
infallibility of the Church, haue bene <hi>corrupted (if it had been
posſible) than any other, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d made to ſpeake as they do for our
advantage:</hi> Wherin you confess that actually ſome places of Scripture
ſpeake for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and then who are you, to controwle Gods Word, and
ſpeak againſt thoſe, for whoſe advantage it ſpeakes? Morover you
ſay, no proof can be pretended for the infallibility of the Church, but
incorrupted places of Scripture; where you ſignify, that nothing can be
proved, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſ we know certainly what places be incorrupted. Now I aske:
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was poſſible for vs to corrupt thoſe places which we bring to
proue the infallibility of the Church, or it was not poſſible? If it were
not poſſible; then you wrong vs, in ſaying, that it is both poſſible,
and not altogeather improbable, that we haue done it. If it be poſſible
then as I ſayd, what certainty haue you, that we haue not done it, ſeing
you ſay, it is both poſſible, and not improbable that we haue done ſo?
Or what certainty can you haue, that others haue not done the like in other
Texts for defence of their ſeverall Doctrines?</p>
               <p n="79">79. Laſtly. You ſtill go vpon a falſe ground; that
we cannot proue the Church, otherwiſe then by Scripture; wheras we muſt
firſt proue Scripture, by the Church.</p>
               <p n="80">80. 8. How vncertaine your kind of Tradition is, appeares
by <pb n="341" facs="tcp:59214:179"/>your owne words, which are ſuch, as no enemy of
Chriſtian Religion could haue vttered more to the prejudice therof, than you
doe (Pag: 90. N. 101.) Where in the Perſon of a member of the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
Church of England: you ſpeake to Catholiks in this manner: You <hi>haue
wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo exceedingly his</hi> (Chriſts) <hi>Miracles and his Doctrine,
by forging ſo evidently ſo many falſe Miracles for the confirmation of
your new Doctrine; which might giue vs juſt occaſion, had we no other
aſſurance of them but your Authority, to ſuſpect the true ones.</hi>
(what Authority haue you but that of the Roman Church and ſuch as agreed with
Her?) <hi>Who with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſo many falſe Storyes, and falſe Authors,
haue taken a faire way to make the Faith of all Storyes Queſtionable; if we
had no other ground for our belief of them but your Authority; who haue brought
in Doctrines plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly contrary to that which, you confess to be
the word of Chriſt</hi> (ô portentuous vntruth!) <hi>and which, for the
moſt part, make either for the honour or profit of the Teachers of them:
which (if there were no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Chriſtian and the Roman
Church) would be very apt to make ſuſpt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ious men belieue that Chriſtian Religion was a

there before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except Roman Catholiques, and ſuch as agreed with them?
And therefore what difference can you put between good Chriſtians and Roman
Catholicks?) <hi>Who make a profesſion of corrupting all ſorts of Authors:
a ready courſe to make it juſtly questionable whether any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may ne
vncorrupted. For if you take this Authority vpon you, vpon the ſix Ages last
past; how ſhall we know, that the Church of that tyme, did not vſurpe the
ſame Authority vpon the Authors of the ſix last Ages before them; and ſo
vpwards till we come to Chrict himſelf? Whoſe questioned Doctrines, none of
them came from the fountaine of Apostolike Tradition, but haue inſinuated
themſelves into the streames, by little and little, ſome in one Age, and
ſome in another, ſome more Anciently, ſome more lately, and ſome yet
are Embryos, yet hatching, and in the ſhell.</hi> Thus you; and then
conclude; <hi>Seeing therefore the Roman Church is ſo farr from being a
ſufficient Foundation for our belief in Christ, that it is in ſundry
regards a dangerous temptation against it; why ſhould I not much rather
conclude, ſeeing we receiue not the knowledg of Christ and Scriptures from
the Church of Rome, neither from her must we take his Doctrine, or the
Interpretation of Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="81">81. Now let the Reader conſider. 1. If the Roman
Church, and all <pb n="342" facs="tcp:59214:180"/>thoſe Churches which agreed with Her
before Luther, that is, all true Churches of Chriſt, be ſuch a thing as he
deſcribes, what can they contribute to make vp any part of his vniverſall
Tradition? Yea ſhe muſt needs make it ſuſpected for falſe,
fallacious, fraudulent. And then what Tradition will remayne creditable, or
even conſiderable? The Greeke Church agreed, and at this day agrees with
Catholiques againſt Proteſtants, as is manifeſt and confeſſed by
learned Proteſtants, for which cauſe they did directly refuſe to joyne
with Luther and his Aſſociates. The Muſcovites, Armenians, Georgians,
Aethiopians, or Abiſſines, either hold the Doctrine of Eutyches, which even
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants deteſt as a damnable Hereſy, or vſe Circumciſion, or for
the reſt agree with the Greek and Roman Church, and they can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
little to your Tradition. I deſire the Reader to peruſe <hi>Charity
Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> C 5. from N. 48. to 54. were he will find clearly
demonſtrated what I haue now ſayd of the Greek, and other Churches. Since
then you blaſt the credit of the Roman Church, and ſuch as agreed with Her
a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt Proteſtants, there will remayne no Tradition at all.</p>
               <p n="82">82. 2. You ſay: That we by forging Miracles <hi>Might
giue just occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had</hi> you <hi>no aſſurance of them but our
Authority, to ſuſpect the true ones,</hi> of Chriſt; and by <hi>forging
ſo many falſe storyes, and falſe Authors, haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a faire way to make
the faith of all Storyes questionable, if</hi> you <hi>had no other ground
for</hi> your <hi>belief of them, but</hi> our <hi>Authority.</hi> This is your
Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion or Major Propoſition: to which if an enemy of Chriſtian
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will ſubſume, and add this Minor which is evidently true: But you
can haue no aſſurance of Miracles, and ground for belief of Storyes, but by
our Teſtimony or Tradition, as I haue clearly proved; What will be the
Concluſion, but this; That there is juſt occaſion to ſuſpect true
Miracles of Chriſt, and Queſtion all Storyes? Behold the effect of your
Tradition! This I confirme out of what you ſay in your Anſwer to the
Direction, where having firſt ſet downe your nynth Motive to be a
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, in theſe words: <hi>Becauſe the Protestant cauſe is now, and
hath been from the beginning, mayntayned with groſſe falſifications, and
calumnyes: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their prime controverſy Writers, are notoriouſly, and in
high degree guilty:</hi> Your anſwer is this (N. 43.) <hi>To the</hi> 9.
<hi>Iliacos intra muros peccatur &amp; extra. Papists are more guilty of this
fault then Protestants.</hi> Which though it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry falſe, as it touches
vs, and not ſo much as offered to be proved by you, yet it clearly
deſtroyes your owne kind of Tradition. For if both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and
Catholiks be notoriouſly, and in high degree guilty of gross 
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59214:180"/>falſifications in theſe tymes, why may not the ſame
be ſayd to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks in former Ages according to your deduction from the
ſix Ages laſt paſt, to the ſix laſt Ages before them, and vpward till
we come to Chriſt himſelf? And ſo neither Catholikes, nor Proteſtants
need now, corrupt Authors or Hiſtoryes, but will find it done to their hands;
vnless your meaning be that Proteſtants maintayne their cauſe with more
gross falſifications and Calumnyes, and are more notoriouſly, and in a
higher degree guilty therof than any Heretiks before them. But why do I ſpeak
by Inferences, and argue by parity of reaſon? Since you alſo expreſſly,
directly, and immediatly aſſirme what I inferred, while you ſay to vs:
<hi>If you take this Authority vpon you, vpon the ſix Ages laſt; how
ſhall we know, that the Church of that tyme, did not vſurpe the ſame
Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Authors of the ſix laſt Ages before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and ſo
vpwards till we come to Chriſt himſelf?</hi> In which words you ſay much
more then I inferrd, that by your reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we could not be ſure but that as
Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are, by your owne confeſſion, notoriouſly guilty of gross
falſifications in a high degree, ſo former heretiks haue bene. For you
ſpeake even of the Church, and aske, how ſhall we know, that the Church of
that tyme did not Vſurpe the ſame Authority (of corrupting) vpon the
Authors of the laſt ſix A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges before them, and ſo vpwards till &amp;c:
And this will appeare more eaſy to haue bene done in the tymes neareſt our
Saviour and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, when fewer Authors did write, in ſo much as
ſome Proteſtants affirme S. Juſtine to be the firſt whoſe Writings
are not ſpurious, and that helived A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 140. And if the firſt writings and
ſtoryes be once cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, what certainty can we haue of the reſt? And
then, Good Sr. If we cannot know, but that the Church hath done this, what is
become of your tradition, which, for ought you proofess to know, will deliver
only fained Authors, corrupted Storyes, forged Miracles, Apocriphall
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? But in this lyes a myſtery not knowen to every one, vnless he
haue ſome acquaintance with Socinian Writers, who press Proteſtants with
this Argument: If the Church might erre, and is belieued by you to haue erred
in the Ages next precedent to Luther, and ſo vpwards from Age to Age, till
the firſt ſix hundred yeares after Chriſt, (which you ſay were pure)
what certainty or ſolid Reaſon can you alledg, why the Church might not
alſo erre in thoſe yeares, ſince you do not hold Her to haue bene
Infallible? An Argument vnanſwerable by Proteſtants, who ther for muſt
either admit the Church in all Ages to be infallible, or els 
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59214:181"/>can haue no certainty, that ſhe did not erre, or
corrupt, or permitted the corruption of Authors and Storyes, and Scriptures,
and forging of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in any Age farr from, or neere to the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="83">83. 3. If the motives of Honour and profit which you
Object againſt the Roman Church, <hi>Would be very apt to make ſuſpicious
men belieue that Chriſtian Religion was a humane invention, taught by ſome
cunning Impoſtors to make themſelves rich and powerfull, if there were no
difference between the Chriſtian and Roman Church:</hi> I beſeech you,
either informe vs, what Chriſtian Church diſtinct from the Roman, or ſuch
as agreed with Her againſt Proteſtants, was there before Luther, to wipe
away this your cauſe of ſuſpition? Or els giue vs leaue to inferr, that
you grant there was indeed cauſe of that ſuſpotion. You ſay (Pag: 14.
N. 14.) <hi>I know no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants that hold it neceſſary to be able to
proue a perpetuall viſible Church diſtinct from yours.</hi> If this be not
neceſſary, it remaynes, either, that it is not neceſſary to free
Chriſtian Religion, from being eſteemed a humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention taught by
ſome cunning Impoſtors, or that you are highly and even ridiculouſly
injurious againſt the Roman Church, as if ſhe a one, though not diſtinct
from the Proteſtant Church, could give occaſion of any ſuch wicked
ſuſpicion: and finally that if ſtill you will ſay, there is any thing
which would be apt to make ſuſpicious men belieue that Chriſtian Religion
is a humane inve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, it muſt be the Chriſtian church herſelf, which is
a blaſphemy fit for ſuch as you are, who reduce our belief of Scripture and
the aſſent of Chriſtian Faith, to Probability, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and meere humane
Tradition, and ſuch as being (according to your Principles) for ought you
know, corrupted, is no better than a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention.</p>
               <p n="84">84. 4. What you ſay of vs, <hi>(Whoſe queſtioned

of ſome Bookes, or parcells, or clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Scripture, and of any Point of
Chriſtian Faith; which ſome inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, or Heretike, or other enemy of
Chriſtian Religion will ſay, <hi>came not from the fountaine of Truth, but
haue inſinuated themſelves, into the ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, by litle, and litle,

not ſure but in fact that happened, if we deny a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving watchfull Guide,
aſſiſted infallibly by the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt) Your Tradition
will alſo looſe all credit, as being ſubject to the <pb n="345" facs="tcp:59214:181"/>like danger of not coming from the fountaine of Apoſtolike
Tradition, but of being corrupted, forged, and having inſinuated itſelf by
litle, and litle &amp;c: For if this may happen ſo eaſily to Authors,
Hiſtoryes, Tradition, and Doctrine, your Tradition being confeſſedly no
other but humane Hiſtorye, is manifeſtly ſubject to the ſame exception,
and totall vncertainty.</p>
               <p n="85">85. 5. You ſay of vs: <hi>who make a profesſion of
corrupting all ſorts of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: a ready courſe to make it justly
questionable, whether any remaine incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</hi> I beſeech you where, or
when made we profeſſion of corrupting all ſorts of Authors? Yourſelf
know this to be a vaſt vntruth. But if it were true, and were a ready
courſe to make it juſtly queſtionable whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any remaine incorrupted,
it ſeemes (by this your owne ſaying) you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue your Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
any ſort of Authors, which may not be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly queſtioned, whether or no
they remaine vncorrupted, And is not this a goodly Tradition to be the ground
of our belief of Scripture, and all Chriſtian Religion? May not the enemyes
of Chriſtian Religion, triumph, and ſay we can alledg no Authors which may
not juſtly be queſtioned, whether they be not corrupted? Which in effect is
all one for erecting an Act of Faith, as if we were ſure, they were
corrupted.</p>
               <p n="86">86. 6. You ſay: <hi>Seing the Roman church is ſo farr
from being a ſufficient foundation for our belief in Chriſt, that it is in
ſundry regards a dangerous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation againſt it; why ſhould I not much
rather Conclude: Seing we receiue not the knowledg of Chriſt and Scriptures
from the church of Rome, neither from her muſt we take his Doctrine, or
interpretation of Scripture?</hi> But ſtill I muſt aske, from what true
Chriſtian church could England, or any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of any church in England,
receyue the Scripture and knowledg of Chriſt, except from the Church of Rome,
and ſuch as agreed with Her? You confess it is not neceſſary to proue any
church diſtinct from ours before Luther, and yet you will not deny, but it is
neceſſary to receiue the Scripture from ſome church, ſeing you profess
to belieue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which you hold for a ſufficient foundation of your
belief in Chriſt) vpon the ſole Authority of the church, and therfor you
muſt take the direct negatiue of your concluſion, and ſay: ſeing we
receiue the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſt and Scriptures from the church of Rome, from
her we muſt take his Doctrine and the interpretation of Scripture. Having
thus pondered your ſayings, and proved that they overthrow Chriſtian
Religion, we may now goe forward to impugne this your Tradition. And
therfor</p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:59214:182"/>
               <p n="87">87. 9. We haue ſhewed, how vncertaine and dangerous
your Tradition muſt needs be, by reaſon of corruption to which all writings
haue bene ſubject, if your Aſſertions were true. But beſides this, I
will demonſtrate how inſufficient your Tradition muſt be of it ſelf,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d much more if you add the ſayd danger of corruption. (Pag: 273. N. 56.)
You alledg <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſaying (Part. 1. Chap: 5. N. 17.)
<hi>VVhen Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeared, there were not two diſtinct viſible true
Churches, one pure, the other corrupted. For, to faine this diverſity of two
Churches, cannot ſtand with record of Hiſtoryes, which are ſilent of any
ſuch matter;</hi> and then you reply, in theſe words: <hi>The ground of
this is no way certaine, nor here ſufficiently proved. For, wheras you ſay,
Hiſtoryes are ſilent of any ſuch matter, I anſwer, there is no
necesſity, that you or I ſhould haue redd all Hiſtoryes that may be
extant of this matter, nor that all ſhould be extant that were written, much
less extant vncorrupted: eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your Church, which had
lately all power in her hands, hath bene ſo perniciouſly industrious, in
corrupting the monuments of Antiquity that made against her; nor that all
records ſhould remayne which were written; nor that all ſhould be recorded
which was done.</hi> Nothing could haue bene ſpoken more effectually, to
proue the neceſſity of a Living Judge; who being once vpon good and ſolid
reaſon moſt certainly believed to be infallible, (as the Apoſtles proved
their owne infallibility) takes away all doubt, or poſſibility of feare,
leaſt the want, or corruption, or alteration, or contrariety of any writings,
or records, may weaken our Belief of whatſoever ſuch an Authority
propoſes. For, till one be ſetled in the ſtrength of ſuch an Authority,
one may be doubting of whatſoever fallible Tradition, whether there may
<hi>not be extant</hi> ſome Storyes, Records, or Tradition, contrary to that
which he followes, there being no neceſſity that he <hi>ſhould haue redd
all Storyes,</hi> nor that all Hiſtoryes or Records <hi>ſhould be extant
that were written;</hi> which if they had bene extant, and had come to his
knowledg, perhaps might haue moved him to relinquiſh the Tradition, which now
he embraceth; <hi>nor that all ſhould be recorded which was done;</hi> and
therfor he cannot tell whether ſomthing may not haue bene done, repugnant to
that which his Tradition induces him to belieue; nor finally, whether the
Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which he relyes, hath not bene corrupted, and therfor ſit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to lead him into, and keepe him, in errour. Which yet is further confirmed by
your words (Pag: 266. N. 35.) <hi>Why may not you miſtake in thinking that in
former Ages, in ſome country or other, there were not <pb n="347" facs="tcp:59214:182"/>alwayes ſome good Chriſtians, which did not ſo much as
externally bow their knees to your Baal?</hi> And then Sr: why may not you
miſtake, in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that in former ages there were not alwayes ſome good
Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who did not agree with thoſe from whom you take your
Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Tradition, which therfor will indeed ceaſe to be Vniverſall?
Do you not ſee how ſtrongly you argue againſt yourſelf? And yet my next
Reaſon will affoard more in this kind.</p>
               <p n="88">88. 10. I take an Argument from what you deliver (Pag:
130. N. 6.) where, impugning ſome who as you ſay, <hi>Hold the Acceptation
of the decrees of Councells by the Vniverſall Church, to be the only way to
decide Controverſyes;</hi> You haue theſe words: <hi>VVhat way of ending
controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes can this be, when either part may pretend, that they are part
of the Church, and they receaue not the decree, therfor the whole Church hath
not receyved it?</hi> I beſeech you, apply your owne words thus: what way of
ending Controverſyes about the Canon of Scripture, can this be, when either
part may pretend, that they are part of the Church, and they receiue it not,
therfor the whole Church hath not receyved it? By this doctrine of yours,
thoſe Heretiks who (as you confess Pag: 361. N 40. out of S. Irenaeus) did
accuſe the Scriptures, as if they were not right, and came not from good
Authority, might haue defended themſelves, by ſaying, the whole Church had
not receyved them, becauſe they themſelves were part of the Church, and did
not receiue them. According to this account, your vniverſall Tradition comes
to be nothing; becauſe whoſoever diſſent from the reſt, will be ready
to ſay, that they alſo are part of the whole, and ſo no Tradition
contrary to them, can be vniverſall; juſt as you ſay, that Luther and his
fellowes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not from the whole Church, becauſe they did not depart
from themſelves, and they were part of the Church. Alſo (Pag: 362. N. 41.)
You overthrow your owne Tradition, while you write thus: <hi>Though the
conſtant and vniverſall delivery of any doctrine by the Apoſtolike
Churches ever ſince the Apoſtles, be a very great Argument of the truth of
it. Yet there is no certainty but that truth, even Divine truth, may through
mens wickedness, be contracted from its vniverſality, and interrupted in its
perpetuity; and ſo looſe this Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and yet not want others to
juſtify and ſupport itſelf. For it may be one of thoſe principles which
God hath written in all mens harts, or a concluſion evidently ariſing from
them: It may be either contayned in Scripture in express termes, or deducible
from it by appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi> But good Sr. ſeing that the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
Scripture, or what Books be Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>onicall, is not <hi>one of thoſe principles, 
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59214:183"/>which God hath written in mens harts,</hi> nor a
<hi>concluſion evidently ariſing from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> nor is <hi>contained
in Scripture in express termes, or deducible from it by apparent
conſequence,</hi> it being your owne Aſſertion (Pag: 69. N. 46.) that it
need not to be proved, that <hi>the Divinity of a writing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be knowne
from itſelf alone, but by ſome extrinſecall Authority; for no wiſe man
denyes it;</hi> it followes, that according to your Principles it can be knowne
only by <hi>the conſtant and Vniverſall delivery of all Churches ever
ſince the Apoſtles.</hi> Now, as you ſay, there is no certainty but that
a <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>truth, even a Divine truth,</hi> conſtantly and
vniverſally delivered by the Apoſtolique Churches, <hi>may through mens
wickedness be contracted from its vniverſality and interrupted in its
perpetuity;</hi> So alſo may the Canon, or Bookes of Scripture (which can
haue no other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to juſtify and ſupport them beſide Tradition) run
the ſome hazard by the wickednenss of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſo come to looſe
vniverſality a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d perpetuity, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo cannot juſtify a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſupport any
Divine truth. And as true Books may come to looſe, ſo falſe ones may, by
the wickedness of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, come to gaine authority, vnless we be aſſured of the
contrary, by the belief of an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Guide, which can never admit of
Apocryphall, of falſe Scripture.</p>
               <p n="89">89. 11. I goe forward to impugne your Tradition out of
your owne words (Pag: 14. N. 14.) were you ſay: <hi>Though you ſay, that
Chriſt hath promiſed there ſhall be a perpetuall viſible Church; Yet
you yourſelves doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that he hath promiſed there ſhallbe
Hiſtoryes and Records alwayes extant of the profeſſours of it in all
ages: nor that he hath any where enjoyned vs to read thoſe Hiſtories that
we may be able to ſhew them.</hi> Out of theſe words I argue thus: It is
not ſufficient for your vniverſall Tradition of all Ages, that the whole
Church of this age, for example, accept a Booke for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, vnless it can
be proved to haue bene receyved by all Churches of all ages, as (Pag: 152. N.

it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for you to affirme, that there alwayes muſt be

that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was delivered for the word of God by the Apoſtles; But You
<hi>do not pretend that God hath promiſed that there ſhall be Historyes or
Records alwayes extant; nor that he hath any where enjoyned vs to reade theſe
Historyes that we may be able to ſhew them,</hi> and by them know the true
Books of Scripture. Therfor you muſt grant out of your owne aſſertion,
that you haue no ſufficient meanes to know and rely vpon your Tradition:
eſpecially if <pb n="349" facs="tcp:59214:183"/>we conſider, that vnlearned men cannot
poſſibly know, whether there be ſuch ſufficient ground, and
Hiſtoryes, as are neceſſary to make it Vniverſall; and yet all ſorts
of people, muſt haue neceſſary and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meanes for the knowledg
of all things neceſſary to ſalvation: which meanes Proteſtants affirme
to be the Scripture alone. But with vs the caſe is farr different, who
belieue a Perpetuall Viſible Church. For, we believing that Church to be
Infallible in one age, as well as in another, are not obliged to ſeeke after
hiſtoryes or Records of tymes paſt (as you are for your humane fallible
Tradition,) in regard the Church being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes exiſtent and Viſible, is
perpetually indued whith ſuch Notes, Prerogatives, and Evident Signes, as
make her manifeſt in every age, and worthy of credit in matters belonging to
Religion; and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Points, for this in particular, that herſelf
muſt alwayes be Viſible, as ſhall be declared herafter more at large;
though it be alſo true, that it may be evidently ſhewed, for every age, by
all kind of Witneſſes, as well friends as Adverſaryes, that our Church
hath alwayes had a viſible Being, and Proſeſſours of her Doctrine, with
a perpetuall Succeſſion of Paſtours; and this ſo manifeſtly, that it
can no more be denyed, than that there haue bene Chriſtians ever ſince the
tyme of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; yea or that there have bene Emperours, Kings, Writers,
Warrs, or ſuch publike things, as no man can deny. But you (who ground. your
belief of Scripture and all Chaiſtianity vpon a fallible Tradition, knowne by
Humane Hiſtoryes and Records of all ages) and every one of your ſect,
muſt either deſpayre of ſalvation, or els procure to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and
verſed in all Hiſtoryes: though yet even this will not preſerue them from
cauſe of deſpaire, conſidering how inſufficient hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tradition is of

add your ſaying (Pag: 361. N. 40.) <hi>The Fathers did vrge the joynt Trad

joynt Tradition of all the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Churches, ſurely you can Vrge it
only for a very probable, and no demonſtratiue Argument: eſpecially, if we
reflect, that you profess the whole vniverſall Church before Luthers tyme, to
haue fallen into many, great, and gross errours, even concerning the Canon of
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſequently, that the firſt vniverſall Tradition, from
the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, came to be altered and corrupted; and that your forſayd very
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59214:184"/>probable Argument de facto hath fayled, if your Hereſy
were true, that the whole Church hath fallen into errour.</p>
               <p n="90">90. 12. (Pag: 149. N. 38.) You ſay: <hi>I must learne
of the Church, or of ſome part of the Church, or I cannot know any thing
Fundamentall or not Fundamentall. For how can I come to know, that there was
ſuch a Man as Christ, that he taught ſuch Doctrines, that he and his
Apoſtles did ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in confirmation of it, that the Scripture is
Gods Word, vnless I be taught it? So then the church is, though not a certaine
foundation and proof of my Faith, yet a neceſſary introduction to it.</hi>
I confess I haue ſtudyed to find what ſenſe you can haue in theſe
words; and can find nothing but contradictions: and finally, that your owne
Tradition cannot be a ſufficient ground for our belief of Scripture. You
ſay, <hi>I must learne of the Church, or of ſome part of the Church, or I
cannot know any thing Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, or not Fundamentall:</hi> And in

or ſome part of the Church? Is your meaning, that the Tradition of ſome
part of the Church is ſufficient to believe Scripture to be the Word of God?
Againſt this you profess every where, that the Scripture is to be receyved
only vpon vniverſall Tradition of all Churches, and Times from the
Apoſtles. At leaſt, will you haue it a neceſſary introduction to Faith?
I do not ſee how you can ſay this, ſeing you profess to diſallow S.
Auſtines ſaying, as we haue ſeene a little before: That, Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was practiſed or held by the vniverſall Church of his tyme, muſt needs
haue come from the Apoſtles: and how can that be a neceſſary introduction
to Faith, which either contaynes a falſhood, or is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly ſubject
to errour, as de facto you Proteſtants proclaime, that the whole Church
before Luther was fallen into groſſe, and as you ſpeake, damnable
errours: and you alſo ſay (Pag: 148. N. 36.) <hi>An Authority ſubject to
errour can be no firme or stable foundation of my belief in any thing: and if
it were in any thing, then this Authority being one and the ſame in all
propoſalls, I ſhould haue the ſame reaſon to belieue all, that I haue
to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue one, and therfore must either doe vnreaſonably, in believing any
one thing, vpon the ſole warrant of this Authority, or vnreaſonably in not
believing all things equally warranted by it:</hi> And therfor you
expreſſly conclude in theſe words: <hi>we belieue Canonicall Books not
vpon the Authority of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church, but vpon vniverſall
Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But then, how is that true, which we haue heard you ſay:
<hi>The Church is, though not a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certaine Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and proofe of my Faith,
yet a neceſſary introduction to it?</hi> For, ſeing <pb n="351" facs="tcp:59214:184"/>Scripture is <hi>the certaine foundation and proofe of your
Faith,</hi> and that, you belieue the Scripture (not for the private ſpirit,
or other criteria, as ſome Proteſtants doe, nor vpon the Authority of the
preſent Church, but) vpon vniverſall Tradition, it followes evidently, that
Vniverſall Tradition of the Church is the certain Foundation and proofe of
your Faith. And this you cannot deny, if you remember your owne Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: That
men may belieue, and be ſaved without Scripture, but not without the Church,
according to your owne ſaying: <hi>I must learne of the Church, or of ſome
part of the Church, or I cannot know any thing Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, or not
Fundamentall:</hi> and in particular that the <hi>Scripture is the Word of
God.</hi> Therfor, ſay I, the Church is a more neceſſary, not only
introduction to Faith, but alſo Foundation and proofe of it, then Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can be: but if you will perſiſt in this your Aſſertion, that the Church
as you take it for a fallible aggregation of men, is not the Foundation of
Faith, and that Scripture both in truth, and according to your owne Principles,
muſt be receyved from the Church; what remaynes, but that the Church muſt
be infallibly aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt in all matters belonging to
Religion.</p>
               <p n="91">91. Laſtly: to ptoue how eaſily men may be deceyved,
vnless they rely vpon ſome infallible Authority, may appeare by what happened
to myſelf, who ſome yeares agoe, falling vpon a wicked Book, vnder a
falſe name of Dominicus Lopez Societatis Jeſu, about the Authority of
Scripture, and as printed in a Catholique cittie; it came to my minde, that in
tyme the Book might come to be accepted for ſuch as the title profeſſes.
My thoughts proved Propheticall. For ſince that tyme, a Catholique learned
Writer cites it for ſuch; though vpon better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, he declares
afterward, in the ſame Work, that the Book was written by an Heretique, and
printed among Heretiques.</p>

divers wayes, that according to ſeverall Doctrines of yours, Scripture cannot
be any Rule of Faith, and much less a perfect one, although we ſhould
falſely ſuppoſe, that it did contayne evidently, and in particular, all
Points neceſſary to be believed. Wherfor it remaynes, that, ſeing
Scripture alone cannot be a ſufficient and totall Rule of Faith, we declare,
what that Meanes is: Which we will endeavour to performe in the next

For, ſince Chriſtian Faith is the Gift of God, and infallible; ſince
Scripture alone doth not evidently containe all neceſſary Points of Faith:
ſince your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way of receiving Scripture as the word of God, cannot
be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to erect an Act of infallible Faith, no nor can be any Rule of
Faith, and much less a perfect Rule; it followes neceſſarily, that there
muſt alwayes be extant a Living. Uiſible Judg; which can be no other, but
the Church of God, againſt which, our B. Saviour promiſed, that the gates
of Hell ſhould not prevaile. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction is ſo cleare, that you are
forced to acknowledg it (Pag 326. N. 4.) Where you affirme, That Catholikes
would faine haue the Doctrine (of the infallibility of Chriſtian Faith) true,
that there might be neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Churches infallibility. Seing then,
both Catholikes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and al Chriſtians firmely belieue,
Chriſtian Faith to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and that this cannot be defended without
believing the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the church, it followes that we muſt either
acknowledg in Her ſuch an infallibility, or tell Chriſtians, that for ought
they know, all <pb n="353" facs="tcp:59214:185"/>that they belieue of God, of Chriſt, of
Scripture, of the Reſurrection, of the Dead, of Heaven, of Hell, of all the
Articles of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may proue no better than a dreame, or an
impoſture, or fiction.

the men in England, to impugne the Roman Church: his Book was approved by three
chiefeſt men of an Univerſity, and was exceſſively cryed vp by his

Church, than hee. But with what ſuccess? No other but this: That
Proteſtants muſt either deny, with this man, all Certainty of Scripture,
and Chriſtianity; or els acknowledg, not the Scripture, but the Church to be

Gods Church: and indeed this alone might ſuffice with Chriſtians: yet</p>

Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone be a Rule of Faith without the Church, you goe vpon humane and
topicall diſcourſes, wheras if all matters of Faith are to be tryed by
Scripture alone, your Arguments ſhould be taken from it alone. For, by humane
Reaſon, we cannot be aſſured of Gods voluntary Decree, whether or no he
will haue vs regulated by Scripture alone. 2. To make your diſcourſes haue
any ſhew of proofe, you muſt ſtill begg the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuppoſe
that there is no meanes left for vs to learne matters of Faith, except the
Scripture: and therfor you ſay, the Holy Ghoſt and the Evangeliſts had
bene wilfully wanting to their owne deſire and purpoſe, vnless they had
written to the capacity of the ſimpleſt, at leaſt all things
neceſſary to be publiſhed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d believed by vs, which
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes all things neceſſary muſt needs be written, and that no
ſuch poynt could be delivered by the Church, though not expreſſed in
Scripture: which is manifeſtly falſe, ſeing the Evangeliſts wrote,
while the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les were aliue, and could deliver by word of mouth not only
ſome, but all neceſſary or profitable Articles of Faith, as Chriſtians
were taught for thoſe yeares before which no Scripture of the New Teſtament
was written: and therfor I may turne the Argument vpon yourſelf, and ſay;
At that tyme, there was no neceſſity, that the Goſpells ſhould be
writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to all, yea or to any: and therfor ſuppoſing the writing of them,
you cannot ſuppoſe that they were plaine, even to the capacity of the
ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt. If writing were ſo neceſſary for all, then enters your
owne Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt yourſelf: How the Holy Ghoſt, and the
Evangeliſts were <pb n="355" facs="tcp:59214:186"/>not wanting to their duty, in
differring ſo long to write; in ſo much as S. Johns Goſpell was not
written many yeares after our Saviours Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, that is, about the yeare
99. which makes it cleare, that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was not ſo neceſſary. I do not
deny, but when they wrote, they wrote for all, but not as if all muſt of
themſelves be able to vnderſtand them without the helpe of the Church (and
in this ſenſe we may ſay, they rather wrote for all, than to all)
otherwiſe all muſt be obliged to learne to read, yea and to be learned, and
be able to judg of langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, tranſlations &amp;c. ſeing from Scripture
alone they muſt learne all Points neceſſary to ſalvation. Do not you
teach, that if one ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue all the Myſteryes of Chriſtian
Religion, though he ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, but even reject Scripture, yet he
may be ſaved? Therfor much more one may be ſaved, though he himſelf
vnderſtand no Scripture, in caſe he haue ſome other to declare it: Yea
even the moſt learned muſt finally not rely vpon their owne abilityes, or
evidence of Scripture, but vpon the infallible Voice and Interpretation of the
Church, as we haue proved. Not only the Goſpells, but all Scripture was
written for all, that is, for the good of all, one way or other: and yet I
hope, you will not ſay it is neceſſary, that all muſt by themſelves
vnderſtand all Scripture. Do you thinke in good earneſt, that none is ſo
vnlearned, as not to vnderſtand all the foure Goſpells? And yet you ſay,
they did not write only for the learned, but for all men. You will ſay: at
leaſt they muſt be plaine to all, touching all things neceſſary to be
believed. Yes, if firſt you take for true and granted, that which you know we
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: that all things neceſſary are contayned in Scripture alone, or that
we can learne them by no other meanes than by Scripture itſelf. And this your
Limitation (at leaſt) inſinuates, that you cannot affirme the Goſpells to
be cleare in all Points: and yet, as I ſayd, and as you ſay, the
Evangeliſts did not write only for the learned, but for all men.</p>
               <p n="8">8. You ſay; This (writing the Goſpells) was <hi>one
eſpeciall meanes of the preaching of the Goſpell, which was commanded to be
preached, not only to learned men, but to all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Anſwer: Preaching and writing are different things,
and we are not wont to ſay, that men preach by writing, or write by
preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet if you meane only, that writing the Scripture is one
eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall meanes for divulging or publiſhing the Goſpell, I grant it,
and acknowledg an infinite obligation to God, for having vouchſafed to 
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59214:187"/>inſpire men for writing the Holy Scripture; but I deny,
that writing was a neceſſary meanes of preaching the Goſpell; which the
Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les themſelves declared in fact, who inſtantly after the receiving
of the Holy Ghoſt, ſet themſelves to preach, but not to write, and they
who wrote, were but few, and thoſe few performed it, not as a thing
neceſſary, or enjoined, but only vpon incident occaſions: Therfor wher
you make this Argument; writing was <hi>one eſpeciall meanes of the preaching
of the Goſpell;</hi> and therfor muſt be <hi>plaine, even to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ſimpleſt;</hi> you ſhould ſay the contrary: Writing was no
neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes of the preaching the Goſpell; and therfor there is no
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that it be plaine to all. Yourſelf ſay (Pag: 35. N. 7.)
<hi>Plaine ſenſe will teach every man, that the necesſity of the meanes
muſt alwayes be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by, and can never exceed the necesſity of the
end. As if eating be neceſſary, only that I may liue, then certainly if I
haue no necesſity to liue, I haue no nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

London, I haue no need of a horſe to carry me thither.</hi> If then, we may
learne all things neceſſary to ſalvation, without a writing or Scripture
(as you grant we may, and as all Chriſtians muſt grant, for the tyme before
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was written) we muſt ſay; therfor it is not neceſſary for
that end; and though it were neceſſary, yet it is not neceſſary that it
be ſo plaine, as every man may vnderſtand it by himſelf, ſeing that end
of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, may be compaſſed by another meanes, which is the
Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods Church. And here I beſeech you reflect on your owne
words (Pag: 79. N. 68.) <hi>That it is altogether abhorrent from the
goodneſſe of God, to ſuffer an ignorant Laymans ſoule to periſh
meercly for being miſled by an vndiſcernable falſe Tranſlation, which
yet was commended to him by the Church, which (being of necesſity to credit
ſome in this matter) he had Reaſon to rely vpon either aboue all other, or
as much as any other.</hi> Therfore, ſay I, we are to belieue, that the
Church, on which we muſt relie, ought to be infallible, that ſo we may
truſt her without danger. For if her Authority be fallible, vncertaine, and
doubtfull, (yea if de facto ſhe erred) ſhe is liable to your cenſure
(Pag: 37. N. 20.) <hi>A doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Queſtionable Guide is for mens

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. But here againe (Pag: 93. and Pag: 94. N. 108.)
(which is put to two §. §) You object, how ſhall an vnlearned man
amongſt vs know which is the true Church; or, <hi>what that Church hath
decreed; ſeing the Church hath not bene ſo carefull in keeping of her
Decrees, but that many are loſt, and many corrupted; and</hi> that <hi>even
the learned among vs are not <pb n="357" facs="tcp:59214:187"/>agreed concerning diverſe
things, whether they be de fide or not: Or how ſhall the vnlearned be more
capable of vnderſtanding the ſenſe of the Decrees of the Church, than of
plaine Texts of Scripture; eſpecially ſeing the Decrees of divers Popes and
Councells are conceyved ſo obſcurely, that the learned cannot agree about
the ſenſe of them, and are all written in languages which the ignorant
vnderſtand not; and therfor muſt of necesſity rely herein vpon the
vncertaine and fallible Authority of fome particular men, who informe them,
that there is ſuch a Decree. And if they were tranſlated into vulgar
languages, why the Tranſlators ſhould not be as fallible, as you ſay the
Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatours of the Scripture are, who can posſibly imagine?</hi> And (N.

               <p n="11">11. This is the ſumme of what not only you, but other
Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are wont to object, and it is the vtmoſt of your endeavours:
But will be eaſily anſwered, by laying this ground: That both in this, and
other Poynts, we muſt diſtinguiſh, between the certainty of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ground, or foundation, and the certainty of that particular mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by which
we actuate, or apply to particular occaſions that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ground, which,
vnless it be firſt belieued with certainty, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue ſtrength, to moue
vs to vndertake with reſolution and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, mattters of great
difficulty. You ſay (Pag: 143. N. 30.) <hi>There is not ſo much ſtrength
required in the Ediſice, as in the Foundation: And if but wiſe men haue the
ordering of the building, they will make it much a ſever thing, that the

fall from the Foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. This Truth will better be vnderſtood by Examples.
That we may prudently yield Obedience, Piety, and Obſervance, (and be obliged
to doe ſo) towards Magiſtrates, Parents, and Superious, it is ſufficient,
that we haue a morall and prudent practicall judgment, that they are ſuch;
becauſe that judgment is ſufficient, to apply the generall ground, that
Obedience, Piety, &amp;c: are due to Magiſtrates, Parents &amp;c: But if that
Generall ground were not certaine, as an evident dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamen of Reaſon, but
only probable, men would not thinke themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves obliged to ſuch dutyes, but
rather would ſtand for their liberty, by <pb n="358" facs="tcp:59214:188"/>pleading
poſſeſſion, and following that other dictamen of Reaſon, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and
Juſtice, Melioreſt conditio poſſidentis. To Hope for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
promiſed to the juſt after this life it is ſufficient, that we haue good
Reaſon, though not certainty, that we are juſt, or in the ſtate of Grace:
But if this generall Principle, The juſt ſhall be eternally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, were
not certaine, few I feare, would be perſwaded to preferr a future
vncertainty, before that which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy certainly, and for the preſent.
You ſay (Pag: 172. N. 71.) <hi>The Spirit of Truth may teach a man Truth, and
yet he may fall into ſome errour even contrary to the truth which is taught
him, if it be taught him only ſufficiently and not irreſiſtibly:</hi> But
if one were not certaine of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ground, That God of his part,
teaches every one ſufficiently, men would not eaſily thinke themſelves
obliged, or would be induced to vſe their beſt endeavours to learne things,
which they belieue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be learned, vnless God alone teach them
ſufficiently, if they had no certainty, that they can hope for any ſuch
teaching. And to come neerer to our purpoſe: If one do verely belieue ſome
particular Poynt to be evidently contained in Scripture: who can oblige him to
belieue that Point with abſolute certainty, vnless he firſt belieue
Scripture it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the infallible word of God? Neither is this enough to
make his Aſſent really infallible (though it were ſuppoſed to be
caſually true) vnless Scripture were not only believed to be the word of God,
but that indeed it be ſo. For, Infallibility of Aſſent, ſignifyes two
things: the one that de facto the thing for the preſent is true: the other,
that it depends on ſuch conſtant Cauſes or Priciples, as cannot in any
poſſible caſe, or occaſion, conſiſt with falſhood, or
vncertainty, which could not be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed, vnless Scripture, in truth, and
reality, and not only in opinion or belief, be the word of God. For, though in
ſome one occaſion it might chance to ſpeake truth, yet in ſome other it
might faile, and cauſe vs to fall into ſome errour. But if we make another
kind of ſuppoſition, That one is told by his Paſtour, or Prelate (whom he
might prudently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue) that ſome Point is contained in Scripture which
indeed is ſo contayned, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he beleeue it as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned in that booke which he
belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to be the word of God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in itſelf is ſuch, and conſequently
infallible; in that caſe, he of whom I ſpoke, may exerciſe an infallible
act of faith, though his immediate inſtructour or propoſer be not
Infallible: becauſe he believes vpon a ground which both is believed to be
Infallible, and is ſuch indeed; to wit, the word of God; who therfor will not
deny his <pb n="359" facs="tcp:59214:188"/>ſupernaturall concurſe neceſſary to
every true act of Divine Faith: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, in the ordinary courſe, there
would be left no meanes for the Faith, and ſalvation of vnlearned perſons;
from whom, God exacts no more, than that they proceed prudently, according to
the meaſure of their ſeverall capacityes, and vſe ſuch diligence, as
men ought to vſe in a matter of higheſt moment. All Chriſtians of the
primitive Church were not preſent when the Apoſtles ſpoke, or wrote, yea
it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that every one of thoſe thouſands whom S. Peter
converted, did heare every ſentence he ſpoke, but might belieue ſome by
relation of others who ſtood neere.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Three things then, are neceſſary, and
ſufficient, for exerciſing an Act of Faith: 1. That the ground itſelf be
infallible. 2. That it exiſt in that caſe; for example, that God haue
indeed revealed ſuch a truth. 3. That he who believes, proceed prudently.
Now, to determine in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, when one may be judged to proceed prudently,
depends on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers circumſtances, of Perſons, capacity, inſtruction
&amp;c. What I haue exemplifyed in Scripture, may be applyed to Divine
Revelation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, which could not be the Formall Object, or Motiue of
our Faith, if it colud beare witness to any leaſt vntruth; and yet we may
belieue by an Act of true Faith, that which we only prudently belieue that God
hath revealed, if indeed he hath revealed it. And ſo, the firſt ground
which I layd, is true; that the Foundation vpon which we fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally rely, muſt
be abſolutly certaine, whatſoever the particular mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by which ſuch
Foundation, or Principle is applyed, may chance to be. This I ſay is true,
ſpeaking of particular perſons, caſes, motives, and, as I may ſay, in
actu exercito, without, touching for the preſent other Queſtions.</p>
               <p n="14">14. This ground being premiſed, I demonſtrate, That
both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vnlearned Catholikes, haue a firme Foundation, vpon which
they build their Faith: and that Proteſtants, whether they be learned or
vnlearned, haue no ſuch ground.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Firſt: we haue proved that Scripture doth not
contayne all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Points of Faith: and therfor for thoſe
neceſſarie Points which are not to be found in Scripture, they muſt
either be ignorant of them, or erre by denying them, or els belieue them vpon
the Authority of the Church, which they expreſſly and obſtinately hold to
be fallible: and ſo we may apply againſt them, your owne words (Pag: 148.
N. 36.) where you expreſſly grant, that vnless the Church be Infallible in
all <pb n="360" facs="tcp:59214:189"/>things, we cannot <hi>rationally belieue her for her
owne ſake, and vpon her owne word and Authority in any thing. For, an
Authority ſubject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, can be no firme or ſtable Foundation of my
belief in any thing: and if it were in any thing, then this Authority being one
and the ſame in all propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls, I ſhould haue the ſame reaſon to
believe all, that I haue to belieue one; and therfor muſt either do
vnreaſonably, in believing any one thing, vpon the ſole warrant of this
Authority, or vnreaſonably in not believing all things equally warranted by
it.</hi> Out of which words it followes, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe any one Point
of Faith for the Authority of the Church, and that it were vnreaſonable in
you to doe ſo; and an vnreaſonable and imprudent Act cannot be
ſupernaturall, or be pleaſing to God, nor proceed from the ſpeciall
motion of the Holy Ghoſt, as every Act of Divine Faith muſt doe. Therfor,
ſince Proteſtants rely vpon Scripture alone, which contaynes not all
neceſſary Points of Faith, the beſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongſt them muſt be
deſtitute of ſomthing neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then what ſhall
we ſay of the vnlearned, who depend on their teachers? But it is cleare, that
Catholikes learned and vnlearned, who belieue the infallibility of the church,
may learne of Her, and by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or the vnwritten word of God, what is not
particularly contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his written word, or Scripture.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But here, as in divers other occaſions, I muſt
vnexpectedly, yet neceſſarily, make ſome ſtay. <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Chap: 3. N. 15. Pag: 94.) hath theſe words: 
<q rend="margQuotes">If I doubt of any one parcell of
Scripture, receyved for ſuch, I may doubt of all: and thence by the ſame
parity I inferr, That if we did doubt of the Churches infallibility in ſome
Poynts, we could not belieue Her in any one, and ſo not in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
Canonicall Bookes, or any other Points Fundamentall or not Fundamentall.</q> At
theſe words you take exception (Pag: 148. N. 36.) and ſay; <hi>By this
Reaſon your Proſelyts knowing you are not infallible in all things, muſt
not, nor cannot belieue you in any thing. Nay you yourſelf muſt not belieue
yourſelf in any thing, becauſe you know that you are not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all
things. Indeed if you had ſayd, we could not rationally belieue her for
herowne ſake, and vpon her owne word and Authority in any thing, I ſhould
willingly grant the conſequence.</hi> which you proue in the next words
(alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by me aboue) <hi>For, an authority ſubject to errour, can be no
firme or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foundation of my belief in any thing</hi> &amp;c:</p>
               <p n="17">17. Anſwer. You haue no reaſon to cavill at the words
of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> which are very cleare, and containe no more
then what <pb n="361" facs="tcp:59214:189"/>we haue heard yourſelf expreſſly
teaching, That <hi>an Authority ſubject to errour can be no firme Foundation
of my belief in, any thing.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for He ſayd expreſſly, <hi>if
we did doubt of the Churches infallibility in ſome Points, we could not
belieue her in any one.</hi> Where you ſee, he ſpeakes of Infallibility,
which is deſtroyed by any one leaſt errour; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot
poſſibly be vnderſtood otherwiſe than of believing the Church for her
owne infallibility, and Authority; and being ſo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, yourſelf
profess willingly to grant the conſequence, which is the very ſame which
<hi>Charity Maintained</hi> did inferr; and even out of the very ſame
reaſon which you did giue. Beſides, he ſpeakes expreſſly of Scripture
and the Church, in order to the propoſing of Canonicall Scripture, or
believing other Points of Faith, Fundamentall or not Fundamentall, which
require a Propoſer vniverſally infallible, as yourſelf grant. And ſo
(to anſwer your Objection) no body can belieue me, nor I can belieue my
ſelf, for my owne authority, in matters which require certainty and
Infallibility, (as all Points of Faith doe) vnless I were believed to be
infallible in all things, for the ſame reaſon, which we haue heard
yourſelf giue; that an <hi>Authority ſubject

               </p>
               <p n="18">18. Anſwer. It is very true, that I cannot belieue the
Divell, with an infallible Aſſent, for his owne Authority, in ſaying,
there is one God, vnless I belieue him to be infallible. But if he proue what
he ſayes, by ſome evident demonſtration, I do not belieue him for his
Authority, but I yield Aſſent to the demonſtration propoſed by him, for
the evidence and certainty of the thing itſelf, proved by ſuch a
demonſtration; and ſo alwayes infallibility in our Aſſent, requires
infallibility in the Ground or Motiue therof: As de facto the Divell himſelf
knowes with an infallible internall Aſſent, yea, and as I may ſay, feeles
to his coſt, that there is a God; but whether you can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue him with
certainty, when exteriourly he vtters that, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Point, meerly for his

into his intentions, by what you ſay in your Anſwer to your Eight Motiue,

<hi>and be afrayd of following Luther, as confesſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to haue bene

I do not confute in this occaſion, it having bene done already in a litle
Treatiſe, intituled <hi>Heantomachta,</hi> or <hi>Mr. Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth

Certainly you haue not obſerved that ſaying; We muſt not bely the
Divell.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The ſame Anſwer I giue to your example of a
Geometritian, whom in thoſe things which he demonſtrates, we do not belieue
for his Authority, but for evidence of his demonſtration, which is
infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; neither did the Author of <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> belieue for
his owne fallible Authority, that he hath written ſuch a Booke, but by
evidence and infallibility offenſe. And here, you ſhould remember your owne
words, (Pag: 325. N. 2.) <hi>Faith is not knowledg, no more then three is
foure, but eminently contained in it, ſo that he that knowes, believes, and
ſomthing more, but he that believes, many tymes does not know; nay if he doth
barely and meerly belieue, he doth never know.</hi> Therfor, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your
owne Doctrine, he who aſſents in vertue of ſome evident demonſtration,
doth know, and not belieue for the Authority of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And who ſees not,
that if I belieue a thing for ſome other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and not for the Authority
of him, who affirmes it. I cannot be ſayd to belieue it for his Authority,
but I aſſent to it for that other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Yea if we conſider the
matter well, when I know one affirmes a thing, and yet do not belieue it for
his Authority, but for ſome other Motiue or reaſon, I may be ſayd, of the
two, rather to disbelieue then belieue him, at leaſt I do not belieue him at
all (for that Point) but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome other Perſon, or for ſome other
Reaſon. Wherfor You do but trifle when (Pag: 138. N. 36.) You ſpeake to
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in theſe words: <hi>You ſay we cannot
belieue</hi> (the Church) <hi>in propounding Canonicall Books,</hi> (if the
Church be not vniverſally infallible) <hi>if you meane ſtill (as you muſt
doe, vnless you play the Sophiſter) not vpon her owne Authority, I grant it:
For we belieue Canonicall Bookes not vpon the Authority of the preſent
Church, but vpon vniverſall Tradition. If you meane, not at all, and that
with reaſon, we cannot belieue theſe Bockes to be Canonicall, which the
Church propoſes, I deny it.</hi> In theſe <pb n="363" facs="tcp:59214:190"/>words, I
ſay, you do but trifle. For, you know that <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> did
ſpeake of believing the Church vpon her owne Authority, which is ſo true,
that you ſay he muſt meane ſo vnless he play the Sophiſter, and what
then ſhall we think, you play, in imputing to him ſuch a ſenſe, wheras
you deny not, but that his words may be taken in a good ſenſe, as indeed
they could not be taken otherwiſe. Beſide, I do not at all, belieue the
Church, when I chance to belieue that which ſhe propoſes, if I belieue it,
for ſome other reaſon, and not for her Authority; and therfor it is a
contradiction in you to ſay, I belieue the Church at all, when I belieue for
ſome other reaſon, as I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aboue. You ſay (Pag: 35. N. 7.)
<hi>I grant that the meanes to decide Controverſyes in Faith and Religion,
must be indued with an vniverſall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in whatſoever it
propoundeth for a Divine Truth. For, if it may be falſe in any one thing of
this nature, in any one thing which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res men to belieue, we can yield
vnto it but a wavering and fearfull aſſent.</hi> Is not this the very
ſame thing which <hi>Charity Maintayne</hi> ſayd? If now, one ſhould
turne your owne words againſt yourſelf, and ſay; <hi>Indeed if you had
ſayd, we can yield vnto it but a wavering and fearfull Aſſent in any
thing for its owne ſake, I ſhould willingly grant your conſequence;</hi>
But <hi>if you meane, not at all,</hi> I deny it: Would you not ſay, that he
did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but cavill? Remember then; Quod tibi non vis fieri, alteri ne
ſeceris. But let vs goe forward.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The ſecond difference between learned and vnlearned
Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, and both thoſe kinds of Proteſtants, is this. You ſay (Pag:
87 N. 94.) <hi>The Scripture is not ſo much the words, as the ſenſe.</hi>
If therfor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants haue no certaine Meanes or Rule to know the true
ſenſe of Scripture, to them it cannot be Scripture, nor the infallible Word
of God. But I haue proved, that Proteſtants haue no ſuch certaine Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
or Rule: Therfor we muſt inferr, that by pretending to follow Scripture
alone, they do not rely vpon any certaine ground, and that Scripture to them
cannot be an infallible Rule. And this being true, even in reſpect of the
learned, the Faith of the vnlearned, who depend on them, cannot poſſibly be
reſolved into any infallible ground; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the vnlearned amongſt
Catholikes, believing their Paſtors, who rely on the Church, which both is,
and is believed to be, infallible, their Faith comes to be reſolved into a
ground really infallible. The like Argument may be taken from Tranſlations,
Additions, Detractions, and Corruptions of Scripture, of which, the learned
Proteſtants can <pb n="364" facs="tcp:59214:191"/>haue no certainty, and much less the
vnlearned; and ſo their Faith is not builded vpon any ſtable Foundation,
and conſequently the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintyes which we object to you, touch the very
generall grounds of your Faith, and not only the particular meanes by which
they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to every one.</p>
               <p n="21">21. 3. I appeale to the conſcience of every vnpartiall
man, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſaue his ſoule, whether in Prudence, one ought not to
preferr the Roman Church, and thoſe who agree with Her, before any compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of Sectaryes; who diſagreeing among themſelves, cannot all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue aright:
and yet none of them is able to ſatiſfy, why their particular ſect
ſhould be preferred before others, who pretend Scripture alone, no less then
they. Of which differences the vnlearned amongſt them being not able to judg,
they cannot prudently joyne themſelves rather to one than another Sect; as
for the ſame reaſon they being not learned, cannot prudently conceiue
themſelves able to convince vs out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no more than they can judg,
what company of Sectaryes is to be preferred before all other, ſeing the
learned Proteſtants cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince one another; eſpecially if we
remember, that they aſſigne for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the ſenſe of
Scripture, many Requiſites and Rules, which exceed the capacity of the
vnlearned, who therfor muſt reſolue either to be of no Religion at all,
which no man indued with the common light of reaſon, can reſolue, or els
muſt judg that they may ſafely, and ought conſtantly to imbrace the
Catholique Roman Religion: which if they doe, their proceeding being prudent,
God will not be wanting to affoard them his ſupernaturall concurrence for the
production of an Act of Faith, even though we ſhould ſuppoſe that the
particular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate reaſons, which induce them to this reſolution, be not
of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves certaine and infallible, but yet ſuch as, all
circumſtances conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, are prudent, and the beſt that occurre in
ſuch an occaſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; No Man of ordinary diſcretion, knowledg, and
prudence, though otherwiſe vnlearned, can chooſe but haue heard, that the
Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is very ancient, that divers learned Proteſtants thinke very
well of it, and of thoſe who dy in that profeſſion, yea expreſſly
grant, that divers whom they belieue to be Saints in Heaven, did liue and dye
in our Religion: they ſee evidently, that we agree among ourſelves; that
great Miracles haue bene wrought in our Church, with the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of
converting Infidells to Chriſtian Religion: Wheras contrarily, for every one
of the ſayd conſiderations, it is evident, that Proteſtants 
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:59214:191"/>cannot chaleng them; yea, they profess, that before
Luther, the world was in darkness, and that their reformation began with him;
that we hold, no Heretike, whether Proteſtant, or other, can be ſaved
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance, and yet, as I ſayd, that the moſt learned among
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants grant Vs ſalvation; that they haue no peace among
themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, nor can ever hope for it: that they profess Miracles to haue
ceaſed; that they do not ſo much as endeavour to convert Nations, and yet
every Chriſtian believes, that Chriſt commanded his Apoſtles to preach
the Goſpell to Nations, for their converſion: theſe things, I ſay, and
divers other, are ſo manifeſt, that the vnlearned cannot be ignorant of
them, and therfor no Proteſtant can prudently adhere to any particular
Sect.</p>
               <p n="22">22. You in particular, who teach, that Chriſtian Faith
is but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, muſt profess, that even learned Proteſtants haue no
infallible ground for their Faith. For if they had ſuch a ground, and did
certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know it to be ſuch, their Faith would be infallible, which you
deny. But this head of vncertainty doth nothing at all touch Catholikes,
lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or vnlearned, who vnanimouſly believe Chriſtian Faith to be
abſolutely certaine and infallible. Out of theſe grounds I come now to
anſwer your Objections.</p>
               <p n="23">23. You aske, (Pag: 93. N. 108.) <hi>How ſhall an

yourſelf, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to belieue the Scripture for the Authority of the
Church, as for the chief ground of ſuch your belief: and other Proteſtants
acknowledg the Church to be an inducement to belieue it. How then do you, and
they, independently of Scripture, or before they belieue Scripture, know which
of all the Societyes of Chriſtians is indeed the Church? The Church was
before Scripture, and might ſtill haue continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture: in which

the Notes and Markes of Gods Church are ſo patent, that every one may
evidently ſee them, vpon condition <pb n="366" facs="tcp:59214:192"/>that he be not
negligent in an affaire of ſo great moment. 2. I haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed already, that
the Meanes by which, infallible grounds of Faith are applyed to every one, need
not be of themſelves infallible; as alſo I haue declared the difference
between vnlearned Catholikes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, in this behalf. Now the true
Church being once found, your other Objections are of no force. For, that
Church, infallibly directed by the Holy Ghoſt, cannot faile to make Decrees,
and conſerue or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, and communicate them to faithfull people, as need
ſhall require. A thing not hard to be done in the Catholike Church,
profeſſing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to one ſupreame Head, the Vicar of Chriſt, and
Succeſſour to S. Peter, who by ſubordinate Prelates and Paſtours, can
eaſily and effectually convey Decrees, Ordinations, and Lawes to all ſorts
of Perſons.</p>
               <p n="26">26. You ſay (Pag: 94. N. 108.) <hi>even the learned
among vs are not agreed concerning divers things, whether they be de fide, or
not.</hi> But this can apport no prejudice to the vnlearned, yea nor to the
learned, ſo that they all ſtand prepared and reſolved, to belieue and
obey what the Church ſhall determine; which as I haue often ſayd, ſhe
will be ſure to doe, when it ſhall be neceſſary for the good of
ſoules; and to doe it ſo as her voyce ſhall be clearly heard, and
vnderſtood, by one, or more, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and declarations? Thus we ſee
Generall Councells haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red divers Points of Faith, after they began to
be controverted by ſome, and found meanes to notify them to Catholikes of all
ſorts. I beſeech you, what Chriſtians after the ancient and ſacred
Councell of Nice, were ignorant that Arius, and is followers, your
progenitours, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for denying our Saviour Chriſt to be the Son of
God, true God and equall to his Father? Or what Catholike in theſe latter
tymes is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that Heretikes hold, and haue bene condemnd for holding
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Errours, contrary to the belief and practiſe of the Catholique
Church; as making the ſigne of the Croſſe; The Reall preſence, and
Adoration of our Saviour Chriſt in the B. Sacrament: the Sacrifice of the
Maſſe, Prayers to the Saints in Heaven, and for the Soules in Purgatory;
Worſhipping of Images: Seaven Sacraments: obſerving of ſet feaſts, and
faſts: vow of Chaſtity for Perſons in holy Orders, and Religious men and
woemen, and the like.</p>
               <p n="27">27. You vrge (Pag: 94. N. 108.) How ſhall an vnlearned
man <hi>be more capable of vnderſtanding</hi> the ſenſe of Decrees made
by the Church, <hi>then of plaine Texts of Scripture? eſpecially ſeing the
Decrees of divers Popes and <pb n="367" facs="tcp:59214:192"/>Councells are conceyved ſo
obſcurely that the learned cannot agree about the ſenſe of them. And then
they are written all in ſuch languages which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant vnderſtand not,
and therfor muſt of neceſſity rely herin vpon the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and
fallible authority of ſome particular men who informe them that there is
ſuch a decree. And if the decrees were tranſlated into vulgar languages,
why the tranſlatours ſhould not be as fallyble as you ſay the
tranſlatours of ſcripture are, who can poſſibly imagine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. Anſwer. Take away an infallible living Judg, and
Tradition of the Church, you will hardly find any Text of Scripture containing
the ſublime Myſteries of Chriſtian Faith, evident, even to the learned
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you; as hath bene proved hertofore, and appeares by the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of
your great and irremediable diſagreements; and is manifeſt of itſelfe,
becauſe you haue no certaine Rule when the Scripture is to be taken in a
litterall, figuratiue, morall &amp;c: ſenſe: which difficulty ceaſes in
the Decrees of the Church: both becauſe it is knowen vpon what occaſion,
and againſt what Enours the Church makes
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees (as all know
vpon what occaſion, and againſt whom, the ſacred Councell of Trent was
gathered) and therby it is eaſy to vnderſtand the decrees for the Negatiue
or affirmatiue part, at leaſt for the ſubſtance, and the things chiefly
inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in them: or if any doubt ſhould remayne, the Church can declare
herſelf; which Scripture can never doe. And although the Decrees of Popes and
Councells, are not conceyved ſo obſcurely as you would make men falſely
belieue, yet all obſcurity is eaſily cleared, by ſome further
declaration. As for languages in which they are written, it is Latine: a
language knowne not only to the learned but to many alſo whom we need not
reckon among the learned: and they who vnderſtand not Larine, will find ſo
great vniformity among all thoſe who vnderſtand that Language, that they
cannot remaine vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine concerning the meaning of thoſe Decrees, though
they be not translated into vulgar Languages; or if they were ſo tranſlated
eyther the translations would be found totally to agree, or els it were eaſy
to be informed, which of them did miſtake, ſeing innumerable perſons do
perfectly vnderſtand Latine: and Beſides, as I ſayd, it is evidently
knowne vpon what occaſion the Decrees were framed, and what was the ſcope
of them, and what part they condemned as falſe, or defined as true. But for
Scripture: ſeing you haue no certaine Rule to know the ſenſe therof, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
Tranſlations of Proteſtants are manifeſtly ſeen to be contrary one to
another, the moſt learned among you can haue no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty 
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59214:193"/>(yea, I dare ſay, that greater learning will occaſion
greateſt multiplicity of doubts and perplexityes, vnless there be
acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged an infallible Living Judg) and much less can the vnleaned haue
certainty ſufficient to exerciſe a true Act of Diuine Faith. More of this
matter may be ſeen in <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 2. Chap: 5. N. 32.)
in anſwer to an Objection made by <hi>Potter,</hi> like to this of yours. To
your ſaying: <hi>If the Decrees were tranſlated into vulgar Languages, why
the Tranſlators ſhould not be as fallible as you ſay the Tranſlators of
the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are, who can posſibly imagine?</hi> I anſwer: There is a
manifold dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Tranſlations of Scripture, and of the
Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Decrees. For, every word of Scripture was inſpired by
the Holy Ghoſt: One Text may haue divers literall ſenſes intended by the
ſame Holy Spirit: We are ignorant what was the ſcope of Canonicall Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for every particular Chapter, or Text: Every Reaſon given in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture,
is a matter of Faith: The ſtyle and Majeſty therof ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes humane
wit and manner of writing: All which conſiderations make the Tranſlations
of Scripture, both more difficult, and more dangerous, then thoſe of
Eccleſiaſticall Definitions or Decrees, in which the fore ſayd Reaſons
haue not place, as appeares by what I ſayd even now.</p>
               <p n="29">29. But you would proue (Pag: 94. N. 109.) that no man
can be certaine of the Churches Decrees; which muſt be <hi>confirmed by a
true Pope. Now the Pope cannot be true Pope if he came in by ſimony: Which
whether he did or no, who can anſwer me? He cannot be true Pope vnless he
were baptized, and baptized he was not vnless the Miniſter had due intention:
So likewiſe he cannot be a true Pope, vnless he were rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
Prieſt; and that againe depends vpon the Ordainers ſecret intention, and
alſo vpon his having the Epiſcopall Character. All which things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon ſo many vncertaine ſuppoſitions, that no humane judgment can
posſibly be reſolved in them. I conclude therfor, that not the learnedſt
man amongſt you all, no not the Pope himſelf, can according to the grounds
you goe vpon, haue any certainty, that any Decree of any Councell is good and
valid, and conſequently, not any aſſurance that it is indeed the Decree
of a Councell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">30. Anſwer: Theſe very Objections <hi>Potter</hi>
made, and are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by <hi>Charity Maintayned;</hi> (Part: 2. Chap: 5. N
31.) but you take no notice therof) That your ſuppoſitions are never to be
admitted; but we are ſure, that whoſoever in a tyme free from Schiſme, is
once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted <pb n="369" facs="tcp:59214:193"/>by the Church for a true Pope, is ſuch
indeed. Yet if you will be making ſuch vntrue ſuppoſitions, that the Pope
did enter by Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or wanted Baptiſme, or true Ordination, God would never
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt him to define any thing in prejudice of the Church. Neither are the
occaſions of Defining matters of Faith alwayes vrgent; as we ſee the Church
for the ſpace of three hundred yeares after the Apoſtles, paſt without
any Generall Councell. Yea if de facto any Pope define ſome truth to be a
matter of Faith, we are ſure even by his doing ſo, that he is true Pope, it
being impoſſible, that God ſhould permit his vniverſall Church to be
obliged to belieue a falſhood, or an vncertaine thing, as all are obliged to
beleeve the Definition of one who is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for true Pope. See more of this,

               </p>
               <p n="31">31. But now, Good Sr. I beſeech you reflect, that in
being ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt vs, you haue degraded (or rather haue denyed) your
Biſhops, Prieſts, and the whole Pretended mock-Hierarchy of the
Proteſtant Church in England, which hitherto hath bene ambitious, to proue
the Ordination and Succeſſion of your Biſhops, from the Roman Church, of
which nevertheless you ſay, (Pag: 77. N. 67.) <hi>He that ſhall put
together, and maturely conſider all the posſible wayes of lapſing and
nullifying a Prieſthood in the Church of Rome, I belieue will be very
inclinable to thinke, that it is an hundred to one; that amongſt an hundred

very improbable, that amongſt thoſe many millions, which make vp the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſo; if the fountaine be ſo troubled, or rather none at all, what certainty
can there be in the ſtreame which flowed from Rome to England? if of many
millyons among vs, there are not twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty true Prieſts, (if wee keepe a
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with England to the whole world) there muſt not be among you one
true Biſhop, or Prieſt. And was not your Book fitly approved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly
as <hi>conforme to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of England?</hi>
Neither can you anſwer, that your Arguments proceed only againſt the ground
we goe on, that intention of the Miniſter is neceſſary to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of Sacraments. For, if indeed it be not neceſſary, then you muſt grant,
that thoſe vncertaintyes which you exaggerate againſt our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
Ordination &amp;c: are but imaginary feares; as yourſelf ſay (Pag: 358.)
That ſome <hi>mens perſwaſion that there is no ſuch thing,</hi> as an

any ſuch thing, no more than a mans perſwaſion that be has not taken
Phyſick, or Poyſon, <pb n="370" facs="tcp:59214:194"/>will make him not to haue taken
it, if he has.</hi> (Though, by your leaue, this inſtance of Phyſick
&amp;c: is not convincing; becauſe they who deny an indeleble Character, may
perhaps out of an obſtinate loue to their Hereſy, and hatred againſt our

neither Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, nor Sacrament) and ſo if intention be not neceſſary,
the want of it, cannot poſſibly make any Sacrament invalide. If it be
neceſſary; you haue deſtroyed your owne Hierarchy, while you impugne
ours, vpon this ground, that we hold the intention of the Miniſter to be
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Nay, ſeing not only all Catholikes, but ſome learned
Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants alſo, teach intention to be neceſſary, at leaſt, you
cannot be ſure that it is not ſo; and then againe, you muſt either
renounce your owne Objections, or vndermine, and make doubtfull your Hierarchy:
Which you muſt do alſo in another reſpect. For, though you take our
Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Doctrine about the neceſſity of intention, as one ground of
vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, for the validity of our Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; yet you mention other Points,

               <p n="31">31. But now, to ſay ſomthing by this occaſion,
concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in adminiſtration of Sacraments, whatſoever you
are pleaſed to ſay, yet in true judgment, there is less danger of any
defect in that behalf, than in any other, for example, of Matter or Forme;
which may be vitiated, both by the malice of the Miniſter, and alſo
againſt his will; wheras a due Intention is wholly in his owne power, and
will, and, as I may ſay, coſts him nothing; and we ſuppoſe him to be a
man, not a Divell, delighting in the damnation of Soules, without any ſelf
intereſt: or if in your Charity you will ſuppoſe him to be ſo full of
malice, it is eaſy for him to vitiate the Forme. For, ſeing the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of the Sacrament, doth not oblige him to ſpeake with a voice, loud and
audible to others, he may pretend to ſpeak the forme ſecretly, and yet
either ſay nothing at all, and ſo omit the Forme, or els ſay ſomthing
els: or if he pronounce moſt of the words audibly, he may with an vnder-voyce
interpoſe ſome words, which will deſtroy the Forme, as if, for example,
he ſay openly, I Baptize the, and ſecretly put in this word (Not) in the
Name of the Father &amp;c: And this he may be induced to doe by your doctrine
(that, Intention is not neceſſary and ſo, the want of it will not

worke, hath inwardly the purpoſe of the Church of God.</hi> Conſider, how
this your Divine of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority affirmes, that Sacraments cannot be ſo
much as religious and myſticall actions (which are Attributes eſſentiall
to Sacraments) vnless they proceede from a ſerious meaning; and that this
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath noe difficulty; ſeing it ſuffices that one intend to
exerciſe that Action as Chriſtians are wont to doe; which intention; we may
in a manner ſay a man cannot chuſe but haue. For, though he were a Pagan,
yet if he intended to do what Chriſtians are wont to doe in that particular
action, it were ſufficient. Covell alſo in his defence of Hooker, teachers
the ſame Doctrine: and neither you, nor any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant in the world, can
haue any ground, to thinke that it is poſſible to convince them of fal
ſhood in this matter: and therfor this vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which you impute to vs,
falls heavy vpon yourſelf, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, if indeed they
adminiſter Sacraments without ſuch an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as all Catholikes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
ſome chief Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts belieue to be neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Now as for the Doctrine itſelf of Catholikes about
the neceſſity of Intention; it is ſo reaſonable and cleare, that it is
ſtrang, any can call it in Queſtion. For, I beſeech you, if a madman, or
a foole, ar a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken man, or an infant, or one in his ſleepe, ſhould
chance to caſt water vpon one, and pronounce the Forme, ſhould ſuch an
one be baptized; or if he were baptized already, were ſuch an action of
ſuch perſons, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? If one with purpoſe, only to learne the
manner of baptizing, did practiſe the pronouncing the words, and applying the
Matter, ſhould that be true Baptiſme? If one by chance reading, or
diſputing, or for ſome other end, ſhould pronounce the words of
Conſecration out of Scripture, and that without his knowlege there ſhould
chance to be bread a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wine with in a morall diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſhould he
conſecrate the Euchariſt? Or, are men obliged never to pronounce thoſe
words in ſuch occaſions as I ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed leaſt they conſecrate whether
they will, or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Are not
theſe fooliſh abſurdityes? If you ſay (and it is all that can be
imagined you can ſay) that at leaſt he who pronounces the words, muſt
exerciſe a deliberate, humane, morall, free Action, which madmen, infants
&amp;c. nor even men in their wits, cannot exerciſe, when they are ignorant
of the morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the matter that is to be conſecrated: but that
it is not neceſſary, beſides the ſubſtance of a morall Action, to
intend alſo to adminiſter a Sacrament: I anſwer; firſt, This anſwer
evacuates the ground of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, <pb n="373" facs="tcp:59214:195"/>who ſay, That
intention is not neceſſary, becauſe the words receive force only from the
Will and Inſtitution of God, and therfor muſt not depend vpon the morality
of that Action, which morality depends vpon the intention of him that
pronounces the words: to wit that he intend to doe it ſeriouſly, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not in
jeaſt, or by way only of pronouncing the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall words without their
ſignification: and ſo the ſalvation of ſoules muſt depend vpon a
ſecret intention, of which we cannot be ſure, as men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe many
indeliberate actions without any virtuall or actuall inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion. If for the
validity of a Sacrament, it be ſufficient to exerciſe a deliberate action
without any further reference or Intention, one could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a deadly
ſin, waſh an infant already baptized, and for devotion ſay, I waſh the
in the name of the Father, &amp;c: as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſay, I doe this in Gods
name; becauſe according to this anſwer, it would be repabtizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. I
anſwer: if one be ſuppoſed to intend the performance of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
action for the ſubſtance, no reaſon can be imagined, why he ſhould not
inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to doe as others do in ſuch an action, for example, if the child be
brought to be Chriſtened, and the Miniſter deliberately apply water, and
pronounce the Forme, ether can be no cauſe which can moue him at leaſt not
to intend that which there are wont to do in the like caſe: and to thinke the
contrary may eaſily or almoſt poſſibly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, argues only in you an

               <p n="87">87. Againſt theſe words (Pag: 76. N. 63.) you ſpeak
in this manner: <hi>This Objection, though it may ſeeme to do you great
ſervice for the preſent; yet I feare, you will repent the tyme that ever
you vrged it againſt vs as a fault, that we make mens ſalvation depend vpon

               </p>
               <p n="38">38. Anſwer. I aſſure you, <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> hath never felt, nor ever will feele, any ſuch repentance, as
you mention, having never <pb n="375" facs="tcp:59214:196"/>bene taught to repent him
ſelf of a good deed, as it ſeemes, you confess, his to haue bene, while you
ſay to him: I feare you will repent the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Do you feare He will repent?
the Object of feare is ſome apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded evill; and therfor your feare that
He will repent, muſt imply that it were ill done of him to repent, and
conſequently that he muſt perſiſt in what he wrote; and ſo He may
well do, for any thing you bring to the contrary; all your Objections being
already anſwered, by the Ground which I layed, That more certainty and
ſtrength is required in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Principles of Faith, than in that
particular meanes, or Act, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſuch Principles are applyed in Practiſe
to the Perſon of every one; as for example, we are certaine by Revelation
certitudine Fidei, that he who perſevers vnto the end ſhall be ſaved: but
that every particular perſon doth performe on his part, what is requiſite
to perſever, we haue no revelation nor abſolute certainty, God having ſo
diſpoſed, that we ought to work our ſalvation with feare and trembling.
The further reaſon wherof may be; becauſe if the generall Grounds or Meanes
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, were in themſelves fallible and vncertaine: this want
would be aſcribed to God himſelf, as if he had not given vs ſufficient
Meanes for our ſalvation; but for the particular application made by free
Acts of men, or by Meanes of ſecond cauſes, all the defect is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to
them alone, and in no wiſe to God, who on his part hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Meanes
certaine and ſufficient, as will appeare herafter, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering all the
particulars which you alledg wherby it will be found, that no vncertainty can
be derived from the generall Principles or Grounds of our Faith, (as it muſt
proceed from the very Grounds of Proteſtants) but only from the fallibility,
infirmity, or fault of men in particular caſes.</p>
               <p n="39">39. To this Ground, I add this other briefe
conſideration; That it is one thing to treate, whether or no, a Sacrament be
valid; and an other; whether the defect of an invalid Sacrament. may be
ſupplyed by ſome other Meanes: For example, Intention of the Miniſters is
vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally neceſſary to the validity of a Sacrament (in the ſenſe I
haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) but whether, or when, or to whom, Sacraments be ſo
neceſſary, that they cannot be ſupplyed by other Meanes, muſt be
reſolved, by deſcending to particular caſes, as will appeare after a
while, and will ſhew the weakness of the Objections which you extend to no
fewer numbers or Sections than the 63.64.65.66.67.68.69.70.72.73.74.) And yet
all are the ſame which we haue toucht, and anſwered already; 
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59214:197"/>as that we cannot be ſure that he who abſolves the
Penitent, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates the Euchariſt, is a true Prieſt: becauſe we
cannot know that he or any other was baptized with due Matter, Forme, and
Intention, and for the like reaſons, we are not certaine, that the Biſhop
who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him, was a true Biſhop. But, as I ſayd, theſe vncertaintyes
nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, nor can be, ſo great as you make them, nor do they touch the
Principles of our Faith, but are as it were matters of Fact, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne only
the application of thoſe generall Grounds to particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, for
which we haue no Revelation, or certainty of Faith, which aſſures vs only,
that there ſhall be alwayes in Gods Church a ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhopes
and Prieſts; and this is enough to ſhew that your Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but
exaggerations, and panick feares, as if of many millions, not twenty ſhould
be true Priſts: which in effect is to ſay, that God hath no Providence over
his Church, but leaves all things to chance, or the weakness and poſſible
malice of men. You teach, that we cannot be certain of the Decrees of
Councells, becauſe we are not certaine that the Pope who muſt confirme them
is true Pope: you ſhould ſay the contrary; There haue bene true generall
Councells: Therfor they who celebrated them were true Biſhops, and the Pope
who confirmed them was true Pope. Thus alſo we are ſure true Prieſts haue
Power to abſolue repentent ſinners, and true Biſhops, to or dayne
Prieſts: but not that this or that in particular is a true Prieſt or
Biſhop, or that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular Penitent hath true ſorrow: Otherwiſe
every one muſt be ſure that he is in ſtate of grace, and ſalvation,
making no diſtinction between the vertue of Hope and Faith, but muſt with
abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty belieue, and not only hope that his ſins are forgiven.
And therfor <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> did not object againſt Proteſtants
(who belieue Chriſtian Faith to be abſolutely infallible, and with whom He
had to doe, and not with ſuch as you are) whatſoever vncertainty, but
ſayd expreſſly, that their Faith did rely vpon an vncertaine Ground, and
therefore could not be infallible. And it is ſtrang that you (N. 68.)
ſhould ſpeake to vs, in this manner: <hi>I hope you will preach no more
against others for making mens ſalvation depend vpon fallible and vncertaine
Grounds, least by judging others, you make your ſelves and your owne Church
inexcuſable, who are ſtrangly guilty of this fault, aboue all the men and
Churches of the world:</hi> I ſay it is ſtrang this ſhould be objected by
you (that we make mens ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depend vpon vncertaine Grounds) who profess
that no Article of Chriſtian Faith is to vs certainly true, and therfor
though one were <pb n="377" facs="tcp:59214:197"/>certaine, that he did vſe all meanes
preſcribed by Chriſtian Religion for attaining ſalvation, yet he might
miſſe therof; which is plaine blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, putting our want of
ſalvation, not vpon any defect in men, but vpon the vncertainty of
Chriſtian Religion, and of the Grounds which Allmighty God hath provided for
the belief therof. You ſay indeed (N. 70.) that we belieue the Church to be
infallible, only vpon pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall Motives; but this we vtterly deny. For we
belieue this Point for the ſame Reaſon for which we belieue other Articles
of Chriſtian Faith, which I haue proved, (Chap: 1.) to rely vpon moſt
infallible Grounds.</p>
               <p n="40">40. In your (N. 71.72.) you object no more than what I
haue anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered more than once; That, although particular men may be moved to
accept Chriſtian belief, for ſome immediate reaſon or Motiue not
infallible of it ſelfe, yet ſtill their Faith may be reſolved into an
infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ground, which is Divine Revelation propoſed by the Church of God,
certainly acknowledged to be infallible, as I haue ſhewed; and that no
particular Tranſlations can prejudice vs, who ſubmit to the Church which
God will never permit to be deceyved by them.</p>
               <p n="41">41. For the vulgate Tranſlation of which you ſpeake
(N. 74.75.76.77.78.79.) I need ſay for the preſent only this; That it being
appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſacred Councell of Trent, we are ſure, that it cannot
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne any leaſt Point againſt Faith or good manners: And if by the
fault of the Printers, or by any other meanes, any errour ſhould chance to
creepe into it, the Church can never make vſe of that errour: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for,
to treate here at large of this particular Tranſlation. would be a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
both fruitless, and needless, divers Catholique Divines having learnedly done
it, and every one may goe to Bellarmin (de Uerbo Dei. Lib: 2. Cap:
9.10.11.12.13.14.) where he anſwers all the Objections of Heretikes.</p>
               <p n="42">42. To exaggerate the vncertainty of Baptiſme, and
conſequently of Abſolution, (N. 64.) you will needs ſuppoſe, that <hi>A
ſew, a More, an Atheiſt, or an Arian, or any that believes not the Doctrine
of the Trinity,</hi> are not <hi>capable of having due intention for</hi>
adminiſtring Baptiſme; which yet is very vntrue. For ſuch men as theſe,
notwithſtanding their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Errours, may ſeriouſly intend to do, as
much as they can, and as Chriſtians are wont to doe; in which caſe, if they
obſerue the true Matter and Forme, their Errours haue no influence into their
intention, but are wared and layd aſide as if they were not at all. For, in
effect <pb n="378" facs="tcp:59214:198"/>their intention is this: If Chriſtian Religion
be true, or if this Action of Baptizing be of any valve, I for my part intend
to make of it the moſt and beſt I can. Now this condition being true, and
ſubſiſting, it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, that that Action will be a true baptizing. This
me thinkes you ſhould not deny, who were knowen to be an Anti-trinitarian,
and Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; and yet I conceyve you wold be loath that Catholikes or
Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſhould belieue, that if you baptized any, the Baptiſme was
invalid, and of neceſſity to be repeated. The like I ſay of Abſolution,
which may be valid though the Prieſt be in his mynd an Heretike, vpon ſuch
conditions, as I expreſſed concerning the Adminiſtration of Baptiſme.
You ſay (N. 66.) that <hi>our Rule is, Nihil dat quod non habet:</hi> which
is true in ſome caſes; but we haue no ſuch generall Rule. A Catechume,
for example, or any other may validly Baptiſe, though himſelf be not
Baptized. And no wonder: ſeing the Miniſter is but the inſtrument of
Allmighty God; and it is not required that an inſtrument haue in it ſelf,
all the perfections, conditions, or qualityes, which are communicated to the
effect, although in our preſent caſe the Miniſter immediatly only applyes
the Matter and forme, and makes his intention, all which is in his power to
doe, thoughe be not Baptized.</p>
               <p n="43">43. You ſay (N. 68.) That according to our Principles,
<hi>When we haue done as much, as God requires for our ſalvation, yet can we
by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes be ſecure, but that we may haue the ill luck to be damned;
which is to make ſalvation a matter of chance, and which a man may faile of,
not only by an ill life, but by ill fortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="44">44. This I haue anſwered already; that, to be ſecure
is a happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the next, not of this world, where he who pretends to be
ſecure is in moſt danger not to be ſafe. And beſides, I muſt apply
here, what I noted aboue; That, it is one thing, whether or no, a Sacrament be
valid, and another, whether the defect of that invalidity may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by
ſome other Meanes. If the nullity be of a Sacrament, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wherof is
not neceſſary to ſalvation, it is cleare, that one may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved though
the Sacrament be invalid. The difficulty is in thoſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, as
Divines ſpeake, are neceſſary neceſſitate medij, being ordained to
conferr the firſt juſtifying Grace, and forgiue deadly ſin, incompatible
with Grace. Of this condition are the Sacraments of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and
Baptiſme.</p>
               <p n="45">45. As for the Sacrament of Pennance; the Doctrine of
Catholikes is not ſubject to caſt men vpon perplexityes, as you pretend,
nor to make <pb n="379" facs="tcp:59214:198"/>
                  <hi>ſalvation a matter of chance, which a
man may fayle of, not only by an ill life, but by ill fortune.</hi> For we
teach, that ſin alone is the cauſe of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and neither ill fortune,
nor any thing els. If one in ſtate of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin, were taken out of this
world by a ſuddain death, or fall out of his wits, ſo vnexpectedly, that he
could not repent, he ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not for any new ſin committed by
omitting to repent, which was not in his power to doe in thoſe
circumſtances; but for his former ſins, committed and never forgiven,
becauſe never repented: as if one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving committed a robery, endeavour to
fly, but faile of his purpoſe, he ſhall be executed for his robery, not for
failing to eſcape, though he had not bene executed, if he had not bene taken
in his endeavour to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. And therfor you ſay very vntruly, that
according to our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>when we haue done as much as God requires for
our ſalvation, yet we may haue the all luck to be damned.</hi> For according
to our Principles and belief, God requires for our ſalvation that we do not
ſin, but that we keepe his commandements, which, by the aſſiſtance of
his Grace, all may obſerue; and if we do ſo, we are very ſecure.</p>
               <p n="46">46. But you will ſay, if one haue ſinned, and
afterward do as much as God requires of him for his ſalvation, he may haue
the ill lucke to be damned. Anſwer. God hath provided Meanes ſufficient on
his part, and if by accident, or malice of men, they haue not their effect,
that defect cannot be imputed to God, nor ſhall ever any man be damned except
for ſin alone. This yourſelf muſt grant. For you belieue, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to
belieue, that there are ſome Points of Faith ſo Fundamentall, and
indiſpenſably neceſſary to be believed, that they are, as you ſay,
minimum vt ſic, without which none can hope for ſalvation. Suppoſe then,
ſome Paſtour or other, vpon whom an vnlearned man might pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently rely,
and had no better meanes to informe himſelf, ſhould ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſlly teach
him an errour in thoſe Fundamentall Articles, or els ſay they were not
neceſſary, and that the vnlearned perſon believed his Paſtour: I aske,
what would you ſay in this caſe? Can this poore man be ſaved without that
Faith which is indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation? To ſay, he can,
were to ſpeake plaine contradictoryes, that ſuch a Faith were, and were not
neceſſary: if he be damned, will you inferr, that when one hath done as
much as God requires, for his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, yet he is not ſecure, but may
haue the ill lucke to be damned, which, ſay you, is to <hi>make ſalvation a
matter of chance, and which a man may faile of, not only by an ill life, but by
ill fortune.</hi> If you anſwer, <pb n="380" facs="tcp:59214:199"/>That he is damned, not
for ignorance or errour cauſed by the malice of an other, but for his owne
ſinnes, and that God had provided meanes, ſufficient in themſelves; you
make good what I ſayd, and muſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your owne chiefe Objection
againſt vs: Or if you anſwer further; That if he who fayled in not
believing all Fundamentall Points, had in his former life and Actions
cooperated with Gods Grace, His Divine Goodness would not haue fayld, one way,
or other, to giue him Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and light, without permitting him to be
deceyved in a matter neceſſary to ſalvation. Facienti quod in ſe eſt,
Deus non denegat gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam. God will not be wanting to ſecond his owne Graces,
with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall addition of more, and greater, if we be not wanting to them,
and our ſelves: Which if we be, we cannot be ſayd to haue done as much as
God requires of vs. Deus non deeſt in neceſſarijs; and we ſpeake in a
caſe of neceſſity. If, I ſay, you giue this Anſwer, you anſwer for
vs, who can eaſily transferr the example from one deceyved by a maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Paſtour or Teacher, to another defrauded of abſolution by a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or a
fayned Prieſt; that if the Penitent had kept cloſe to Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations,
he would not haue bene permitted to fall vpon ſuch a Prieſt, or els his
ſoule would haue bene rayſed to contrition, wherby all deadly ſins are
forgiven.</p>
               <p n="47">47. This Inſtance which I haue vrged out if your owne
Aſſertion, that there are ſome Points indiſpenſably neceſſary to
ſalvation, is declared by Potter (Pag: 243.) who ſpeakes thus of
Fundamentall Points: <hi>theſe are ſo abſolutely neceſſary to all
Chriſtians, for attayning the end of our Faith, that is, the ſalvation of
our ſoules, that a Chriſtian may looſe himſelf, not only by a
poſitiue erring in them, or denying of them; but by a pure igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or
neſcience, or not knowing of them.</hi> And to this purpoſe among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he
cites Dominic: Bannez (in 2.2. Queſt: 2. Art: 8.) ſaying; <hi>Invincible
ignorance cannot here excuſe from everlaſting death, though we want them
without any fault of ours, or although it were not in our power to attaine the
knowledg of them: even as if there were one only remedy wherby a ſick man
could be recovered from corporall death: ſuppoſe the Patient and the
Phyſitian both were ignorant of it, the man muſt periſh, as well not
knowing it, as if being brought vnto him, he had refuſed it.</hi> Which words
declare, how one may be damned, by occaſion of inculpable Ignorance, though,
not for it, but for his ſinnes committed, and not pardoned. The like example
may be giuen, of one inculpably ledd into an errour concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Repentance,
which no man denyes to be neceſſary for remiſſion <pb n="381" facs="tcp:59214:199"/>of deadly ſinnes; as, if he were taught, that no Repentance were
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; or that it did require no kind of ſorrow, for what is paſt,
but only a purpoſe to amend for tyme to come; or that it were ſufficient to
conceyve ſorrow only for ſome humane motiue, or ſome temporall ſhame,
payne, or loss, or the like, which is but triſtitia ſaeculi, and makes one
rather a greater ſinner, than a true Penitent; Or els, That Attrition alone
is ſufficient without Abſolution; (which is your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious errour) or,
That it is ſufficient to haue ſorrow for one, or a few deadly ſinnes,
though it extend not itſelf effectually to all: Or, That Faith alone without
precedent Repentance, is ſufficient, or the like. For, as one may be taught
an Errour in other Pointes, ſo alſo in this of Repentance. Now, of men in
theſe caſes, I make the ſame Demand which, I made aboue; whether they can
be ſaved without ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? And it being cleare that they
cannot, and yet are ſuppoſed to haue bene miſled without any fault of
theirs, your Objection turnes vpon yourſelf; how, when you haue <hi>done as
much as God requires for your ſalvation, yet can you by no meanes be
ſecure, which is to make ſalvation a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of chance.</hi> &amp;c: What I
haue ſpecifyed in the belief of Fundamentall Poynts, and repentance, may
eaſily be applyed to other Points of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, neceſſary for
ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Beſides: Many Divines teach, That Contrition is
neceſſary in Divers Occaſions, wherby all his ſins will be forgiven,
whatſoever his Sacramentall Abſolution chance to be. Some ſay, Contrition
obliges as often as deadly ſins are preſented to our mynd vt
practicè deteſtanda. Some, that it obliges vpon feſtivall dayes,
becauſe we cannot ſpend the day in God Allmightyes ſervice, vnless
firſt we be contrite for our ſins; Others teach, That it obliges in
occaſion of ſome publike neceſſity, which we haue reaſon to feare is
inflicted for a puniſhment of our ſins. Others; as often as we are to begin
ſome heroicall worke, vpon which the publike weale, or profit of the people
depends; becauſe the forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and powerfull helpe of God is wont to be
denyed to ſinners. Others, and thoſe, men of great learning, hold. That at
leaſt all are obliged to Contrition at the true, or believed, houre of death,
or in morall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death, (as in warre, or a long and dangerous voyage by
ſea,) becauſe a morall danger of death is equivalent to the laſt houre of
death and this they vnderſtand even though one confess Sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and
much more if he want a Confeſſarius. Beſides, all are bound to
Contrition, either when they adminiſter Sacraments, or receyue 
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59214:200"/>thoſe Sacraments, which are called Sacramenta Vivorum,
if they be guilty of ſome deadly ſinne, not confeſſed. Vide Amicum (To:
8. Diſp: 9. Sec: 3. &amp; 4.) I abſtaine from examining difference of
Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This is certaine, that all Catholikes are taught oftentymes to moue
themſelves to contrition, and all of timorous conſciences and good life
endeavour to doe it; and every body, at leaſt at the houre of death; at which
tyme Charitas propria, or Charity towards ones ſelf, for the ſalvation of
his ſoule, will as it were naturally, and effectually incline them to it,
with the aſſiſtance of Gods Grace, which is never wanting, and ſo
neither the want, nor wickedness of any Prieſt can hurt them. Remember what
yourſelf ſay (Pag 277. N. 61.) that according to Potter, God hath
promiſed to the Church an abſolute aſſiſtance, for things
neceſſary, and then you add; a <hi>farther aſſistance is conditionally
promiſed vs, even ſuch an aſſiſtance as ſhall lead vs, if we be not
wanting to it and our ſelves, into all, not only neceſſary, but very
profitable truth. For, Gods aſſiſtance is alwayes ready to promote her
farther. It is ready, I ſay, but on condition the Church does implore it: on
condition, that when it is offered in the Divine directions of Scripture and
reaſon, the Church be not negligent to follow it.</hi> Why do you not apply
this to our preſent Queſtion, and ſay; <hi>Gods aſſiſtance is
alwayes ready to promote</hi> vs <hi>farther,</hi> (from attrition to
Contrition) vpon <hi>condition we do implore it and be not wanting to it and
our ſelves:</hi> and that <hi>when it is offered in divine directions</hi> of
Chriſtian Faith (taeching, that no care, or even ſolicitude, can be too
great in ſecuring the eternall ſalvation of our ſoules) we be not
negligent to follow ſuch directions. Will you ſay; God is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to
direct our vnderſtanding for the belief of Poynts not neceſſary, but only
very profitable, than he is to aſſiſt our will for exerciſing an Act of
contrition, which is alwayes eminently profitable, and in caſe of deadly
ſinne, and invalid Abſolution, abſolutely neceſſary? To ſay
nothing, that, as I ſayd, great Divines hold it to be neceſſary at the
houre of death even though the abſolution be valid: At leaſt, theſe
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations are more then ſufficient to put every dying man (and indeed
every man) in mynd to implore the Divine aſſiſtance, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the exerciſing an Act of Contrition. If you be reſolved not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
theſe Anſwers, let vs ſee what better you can giue, and how you will
apply it to ſatiſfy the Argument which I haue made to ſhew, that the
Faith and ſalvation of Proteſtants rely vpon vncertaine. Grounds.</p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:59214:200"/>
               <p n="49">49. You ſay (Pag: 79. N. 68.) That it is
<hi>altogeather as abhorrent from the goodness of God, to ſuffer an ignorant
Lay-mans ſoule to periſh, meerly for being miſled by an vndiſcernable
falſe Tranſlation, which was commended by the Church, which, (being of
necesſity to credit ſome in this matter) he had reaſon to rely vpon
either aboue all other, or as much as any other, as it is to damne a penitent
ſinner for a ſecret defect in that deſired Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which his
Ghoſtly Father perhaps was an Atheist, and could not giue him, or was a
villaine, and would not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="50">50. I anſwer as aboue: The totall and proper cauſe of
damnation of men is their ſin, and not any ſecret defect, or invalidity in
the Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therfore in your caſe, an vnlearned man ſhall not be
damned meerly for being miſſled by an vndiſcernable falſe
Tranſlation, but for the ſins which he hath voluntarily committed; and his
damnation can be imputed to himſelf alone, and in no ſenſe to any want on
Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, from whoſe Goodness it is not abhorrent to ſuffer a manes
ſoule to periſh for his ſins; which puniſhment he might haue permitted
and inflicted in the very moment wherin they were committed: for ſin of it
ſelf gives moſt juſt cauſe for a man to be inſtantly lodged in Hell;
as we ſee ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y are permitted to dy in the Act of ſome wickedness, without
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of that juſt puniſhment hanging over their head, and therfore
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out poſſibility to repent vpon the motiue of being ſo forewarned:
neither ſhall they be damned for their vnvoluntary omiſſion of
repentance, in that caſe, but for the ſin itſelf never forgiven. And
this, I returne to ſay, your ſelf muſt affirme, as I proved aboue. For,
ſuppoſe, by ſuch a falſe Tranſlation on were miſled into ſome
errour deſtructiue, of a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall poynt of Faith; ſuch a man cannot be
ſaved, and it would not be abhorrent from the Goodness of God to damne ſuch
a perſon; not for his errour, which we ſuppoſe to be vnvoluntary; but for
his ſins. God hath promiſed pardon to repentant ſinners, but hath no
where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged himſelf to expect their leaſure for repenting, or to giue
his effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Grace at their pleaſure, who believing man to be what he is,
infii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely inferiour to the Divine Majeſty, and infinitely obliged to his
Goodness; and God to be what He is, infinite in all kind of perfections; and
ſin to be what it is, infinitely vgly, deformed, and malitious; a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
I ſay, firmely believing all this, and yet differring his repentance, if it
were but for one mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, muſt blame himſelf alone, if he dy without true
repentance, and ſo be damned for his ſins never repented. If I were not
well acquainted with your cuſtome of contradicting yourſelf, I ſhould 
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:59214:201"/>wonder that you ſhould object to vs, as a thing
abhorrent from the Goodness of God, that men ſhould be permitted to be
miſled by a falſe Tranſlation, and ſo chance to be damned; ſeing you
teach, that God may in his Juſtice permit, true Miracles to be wrought to
delude men, in puniſhment of their ſins; and beſides this, ſeing you
affirme, true Repentance to conſiſt, not only in harty ſorrow, and firme
purpoſe to amend, but to require, as you ſay (Pag: 392. N. 8.) the
<hi>mortification of the Habits of all Vices, and effectuall converſion to
newness of Life and Vniverſall Obedience, and withall, that an Act of
Attrition, which we ſay, with Prieſtly Abſolution is ſufficient to
ſalvation, is not mortification, which being a worke of difficulty and tyme,
cannot be performed in an Inſtant.</hi> It followes clearly out of this
Doctrine, that neither Attrition, nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, can ſaue a poore ſoule
at the houre of death: becauſe this your kind of Repentance, being a
<hi>Worke of difficulty and tyme, cannot be, performed in an inſtant;</hi>
Nor can ſuch a man be ſaved at that tyme, though he doe as much as God can
require of him for his ſalvation in thoſe circumſtances. You object
againſt vs, as a huge abſurdity, that one may be damned by reaſon of an
invalid Abſolution, when as yet it is in the Penitentes will, aſſiſted
with Gods Grace, to exerciſe an Act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, wherby he ſhall
certainly be ſaved; and yet you are not afrayd to tell vs, that a ſinner,
though he do all that poſſibly he can, and haue that moſt perfect kind
ofſorrow, which is called Contrition, yet cannot be ſaved without the
<hi>Mortification of the Habits of all vices, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all converſion to a
newness of life, and Vniverſall Obedience;</hi> Which things cannot be
performed in an inſtant, but require long tyme; And then his damnation
ſhall not proceed from his not doing as much as he is able, in thoſe
Circumſtances, (for we ſuppoſe him to do all that) nor for any
accidentall defect in applying ſuch Meanes as Almighty God hath provided, but
becauſe, according to your Doctrine, God hath not provided ſufficient
Meanes for the ſalvation of a Repentant ſinner at the houre of his death:
Which to affirme, is no better then blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and makes mens ſalvation
depend not only vpon vncertaintyes, (as you object to vs,) but alſo vpon
impoſſibilityes: And they ſhall be damned by reaſon of the nature of
thoſe very Meanes, which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God for forgiveness of their
ſins and ſalvation: that is, by your way of Repentance. The like I may
ſay of your Doctrine, That, Attrition alone is ſufficient for ſalvation;
which being certainly moſt falſe, and if you haue any modeſty, muſt be
even, in your owne Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <pb n="385" facs="tcp:59214:201"/>vncertaine, as not being
the common opinion of Proteſtants, for ought I know, you put ſalvation of
ſoules vpon Grounds which are in themſelves (and not only in the
application of them) vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: And the ſame I ſay of your wicked
Doctrine, that Chriſtian Faith is not infallible, which muſt be a
ſourſe of all other vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes.</p>
               <p n="51">51. Having thus anſwered for ourſelves, and retorted
your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it will not be amiss to examine what you vndertake to ſpeake
for vs, (without any Commiſſion) to a <hi>conſidering man lying on death
bed, who feeles or feares that his Repentance is but Atrition only, and not
Contrition, and conſequently believes that if he be not really abſolved by
a true Prieſt, he cannot posſibly eſcape damnation. Such a man for his
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, you tell, first, (you who will haue mens ſalvation depend vpon no
vncertaintyes) that though he verily belieue that his ſorrow for ſinnes is
a true ſorrow, and his purpoſe of amendment a true purpoſe; yet he may
deceiue himſelf, perhaps it is not, and if it be not, he must be damned. You
tell him ſecondly, that the party he confeſſes to, may be no Prieſt, by
reaſon of ſome vndiſcernable invalidity in his Baptiſme, or Ordination;
and if he be none, he can doe nothing. You tell him thirdly, that he may be in
ſuch a ſtate, that he cannot, or if he can, he will not gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Intention: And if he does not, all is in vaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="52">52. You plead our cauſe ſo feebly and falſly, that
your beſt fee will be, to be ſilenced. Firſt, I haue told you, in what
ſenſe we would haue mens ſalvation depend vpon no vncertaintyes. 2. For
your caſe of a man lying vpon death bed, who feeles or feares that his
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is but Attrition only, and not Contrition; (ſurely if it be
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition only, it is not Contrition) we tell him, that Gods grace is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wanting if we do implore it, (which are your owne words cited by me aboue) and
not neglect to cooperate with it: If therfor he do his endeavour, God will not
fayle to giue him all that ſhall be neceſſary for his ſalvation,
whether it be atrrition with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or Contrition without it; and ſo
it ſhall not be in the Parſons power to damne whom he will in his Pariſh,
as you are pleaſed to ſpeake; and you ſpeake profanely in applying to our
preſent purpoſe, that ſaying; Spes eſt rei incertae nomen, which is to
ſlight all thoſe Texts of Sceipture, which declare that abſolute
certainty or ſecurity muſt not be expected in this life, where we muſt
worke our ſalvation with feare and trembling, ſo that <pb n="386" facs="tcp:59214:202"/>neither Hope excludes a wholſome feare, nor feare a comfortable
Hope; it being alſo moſt true, tha we are ſaved by Hope, and, Hope does
not confound, which ſignifyes more then rei incertae nomen, an empty name
only. By this Inſtruction, the dying man will clearly ſee, that neither
want of Prieſthood in the partie he confeſſes to, nor want of Intention
in a true Prieſt, nor any other thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his owne freewill neglecting
to cooperate with Gods Grace, can damne him. We haue heard your words (Pag:
277. N. 61.) That, <hi>Gods asſiſtance is alwayes ready on condition, that
when it is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the divine directions of Scripture, or reaſon, the
Church be not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to follow it</hi> (I cannot ſtand here to note, that
you ſeeme to place Gods aſſiſtance only in the externall <hi>divine
directions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or reaſon,</hi> without neceſſity of any
internall Grace, which is direct Pelagianiſme) and you put the caſe
expreſſly when the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent feares that his Repenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> is attrition only, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, when
God hath giuen him light to ſee his danger, and the neceſſity of
contrition, and therfor, that God will not be wanting to affoard his Grace, if
he be not negligent to follow it; and by this truth he may prudently quiet his
mind. This ſeemes to be the Doctrine of S. Thomas (3. Part: Q. 64. a. 8. ad.
2.) granting, that, <hi>in perſons indued with the vſe of reaſon, Faith
and devotion ſupplyes the defect of intention in the Miniſter, for
juſtification from ſinne, but not for making the Sacrament valid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="53">53. Let vs heare what more you are pleaſed to anſwer
in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. You ſay; <hi>Put caſe a man by theſe conſiderations
ſhould be caſt into ſome agonyes,</hi> (of your owne making and fayning;
for we cleare him of all) <hi>what adviſe, what comfort would you give him?
Verily I know not what you could ſay to him, but this: That, Firſt, for the
Qualification required on his part, he might know that he deſired to haue
true ſorrow, and that that is ſufficient. But then if he ſhould aske you,
why he might not know his ſorrow to be a true ſorrow, as well as his
deſire to be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to be a true deſire, I believe you would be put
to ſilence. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to quiet his feares, concerning the Prieſt
and his intention, you ſhould tell him by my adviſe, that Gods Goodness
(which will not ſuffer him to damne men for not doing better than their
beſt) will ſupply all ſuch defects as to humane endeavours were
vnavoidable. And therfore, though his Prieſt were indeed no Prieſt, yet to
him he ſhould be as if he were one: and if he gaue Abſolution without
Intention, yet in doing ſo, <pb n="387" facs="tcp:59214:202"/>he ſhould hurt
himſelſelf only, and not his Penitent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="54">54. Anſwer. Firſt; If you ſhould tell him, that
only a deſire of true ſorrow, is ſufficient for remiffion of deadly
ſins, either alone, or with Sacramentall Abſolution, you ſhould deceaue
him. For, a deſire only, is of a thing which one is ſuppoſed not to haue;
and therfor he who only deſires to haue ſorrow, certainly wants it; as he
who only deſires to find the true Faith and Religion, cannot be ſayd to
haue it; though ſuch a deſire may moue him to ſeeke, and ſind, if he
perſever in ſeeking; and in like manner, he who deſires true ſorrow,
may, to ſatisfy that good deſire, endeavour to paſſe from a meere
deſire to the thing deſired, ſeing God will not be wanting on his part to
affoard his Grace to perfit that deſire; and ſo perſons of timorous or
ſcrupulous conſciences, may conceiue they only deſire true ſorrow, when
indeed they haue it.</p>
               <p n="55">55. You ſay: <hi>If he ſhould aske you, why he might
not know his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to be a true ſorrow, as well as his deſire to be
ſorrowfull, to be a true deſire; I belieue you would be put to
ſilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="56">56. Anſwer: All that you can inferr from this your
Objection, is, That you haue put yourſelf to ſilence For you it was, and
not <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> who talked of a deſire to be ſorrowfull,
as ſufficient, though it were alone. Nevertheless, if one ſhould aske,
whether you are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſure, that you did deſire to know and embrace the
true Faith and way which leads to eternall happyness, I ſuppoſe you would
anſwer, that you were abſolutely certaine of ſuch a deſire, and yet you
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not in your Grounds, be certaine that the Faith which you embrace, is true:
For then you would be certaine, that Chriſtian Faith is true, which you
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and accordingly (Pag: 376. N. 57.) You ſay only; <hi>This is the
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which I haue choſen, after a long deliberation, and I am verily
perſwaded, that I haue choſen wiſely.</hi> And yet certainly you thought
yourſelf to haue bene more than verily perſwaded of your generall deſire
to imbrace the true Faith. Therfor one may know his deſire of Faith to be a
true deſire, and not be certaine that his Faith is a true Faith; and then,
why may he not be certaine that he hath a true deſire of ſorrow, and yet
not be certain that he hath true ſorrow? But to omit this Inſtance, the
truth is, that you do not diſtinguiſh between an effectuall, and
vneffectuall deſire; This may be without the effect, or the object of it
which is the thing deſired, but That cannot be: For when we treate of
Actions, which, all things conſidered, are in our power to exerciſe, 
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59214:203"/>if one effectually deſire them, he will not faile to
haue them; For, an effectuall deſire, will moue him to apply all meanes
neceſſary, for, and to remooue all impediments, againſt, that end. And
from hence I inferr, that every one may obtaine true Contrition by the
aſſiſtance of Gods Grace, if his endeavours be not wanting: And even
theſe your exaggerations of the great danger men may incurre by want of
Intention in the Miniſter, or defect in the Matter or Forme of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
and Pennance, may moue him to procure Contrition for making all ſure, and
ſo out of your poyſonous Doctrine make wholſome tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. But you are
miſtaken, if you conceyue the Queſtion to be, whether or no one may know
that he hath either a deſire of ſorrow, or ſorrow, which in generall one
may as it were feele and know; but whether his deſire and ſorrow, be ſuch
as they ought to be, ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, effectuall, vniverſall, and from what
cauſe they proceed; whether from the Divine, Angelicall, humane, or bad
Spirit, who not ſeldome tranſfigures himſelf into an Angell of light.</p>
               <p n="57">57. The ſecond adviſe you would haue vs giue
<hi>concerning the Prieſt and his intention,</hi> is, to <hi>tell him that
Gods Goodness (which will not ſuffer him to damne men for not doing better
than their beſt) will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all ſuch defects as to humane endeavours
were vnavoidable. And therfor, though his Priest were indeed no Prieſt, yet
to him he ſhould be as if he were one: And if he gaue Abſolution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Intention, yet in doing ſo, he ſhould hurt himſelf only and not his
Penitent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="58">58. Anſwer. We haue already ſhewed that if one doe
his beſt, God will not faile to ſupply all defects concerning the Prieſt,
and his Intention, by giving him Grace to attaine contrition; which is a cleare
and ſolid way of ſupplying the ſayd defects, as that which you propoſe
is not, if your meaning be, that although the Prieſt were no Prieſt, or
gaue Abſolution without Intention, yet God would either make it a valid
Sacrament immediatly, as I may ſay, performing by himſelf alone the
function of the Prieſt, or els would giue the effect which the Sacrament
would haue conferred if it had bene valid, without any change in the Penitent;
as if, for example, he had attrition only, his ſins ſhould be forgiven, no
less than if he had receyved true Abſolution, or had arrived to an Act of
Contrition. Now certainly this your way could not quiet the feares of any
vnderſtanding man; vnless you could bring ſome irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable 
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59214:203"/>Authority, or convincing reaſon (which is
impoſſible for you to doe.) that God doth ever make valid an Abſolution,
invalid for want of a true Miniſter or Intention; or that a deadly ſin may
be forgiven by attrition alone. If you ſuppoſe, that God doth effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
moue him to Contrition, you alter the caſe and your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and contradict
your owne words; That, though his Prieſt were indeed no Prieſt, yet to him

which I haue ſpoken before. Firſt then, To deny the neceſſity of
Baptiſme for infants, was the condemned Hereſy of the Pelagians, as
appeares out of S. Auſtine, (Haere: 88. and, Cont: Julian: Pelag: L: 6. C.
7.) which is ſo certaine, that it is confeſſed by the Centuriſts,
(Centur: 5. Col: 585.) and by the Proteſtant Writer, Sarcerius (Loc: Com:

may be ſaved without Baptiſme. And Whitak: Cont: Duraeum, L. 10 P. 883.
ſaith: we belieue and teach, <hi>That ſins are forgiven, and grace
conferred in Baptiſme, which the Manichees were accuſtomed to deny.</hi> 2.
Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants confeſſe, that not only S. Auſtine taught the
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Baptiſme for the ſalvation of Children (for which,
Cartwright in Whitg: Def: chargeth him with abſurdity) but alſo in
Generall, that the Fathers were of the ſame mynd, in ſo much as Muſculus
(in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, Tit: de Baptiſmo) ſaith; <hi>The Fathers deayed ſalvation to
the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who dyed without Baptiſme, though their parents were
faithfull.</hi> In fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe wherof, we need no clearer Teſtimony, than
that of Calvin (Inſtit: Lib: 4. Chap: 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

women, (and this Doctrine he himſelf imbraceth and defends at large,) which
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſenſe of Antiquity, declares evidently the neceſſity of

great Rabbi amongſt Engliſh Proteſtants (in his Anſwer to the 18.
Chapter of Cardinall Perrons Reply N. 18.) expreſly teaches, that Baptiſme

Scripture, and confeſſed to be the Doctrine of the Ancient Fathers
interpreting Scriptures; ſo as our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Doctrine comes to be approved
by Proteſtants, by Scripture, and by the Ancient Fathers, and by
Proteſtants interpreting Scripture: all which Poynts are further taught by
the Proteſtant Urbanus Regius, (In 1. Part: Operum, in Cathechiſmo minori,
Folio 105.) confeſſing that <hi>the Scripture, and the Authority of the
ancient Church, conſtraine him to belieue, that children dying vnbaptized,
are damned.</hi> The ſame Doctrine is delivered by Sarcerius; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by Confess:
Auguſtana: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of Saxony, and ſundry other Proteſtant
Writers, as may be ſeene in the Tripl: Cord: (Chap: 20. Sect: 4. Pag
456.)</p>
               <p n="61">61. Now, we may reflect: Firſt, ſeing theſe
Proteſtants for their Doctrine of the neceſſity of Baptiſme, rely vpon
Scripture, (as indeed the words of Scripture are as cleare for this Point, as
any can be) I would gladly know, what certaine Ground you, or any man can haue,
that ſo many learned Proteſtants (to ſay nothing of all Fathers,
Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and moderne Catholike Writters) haue erred in this their
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture? Is it not your owne Rule, That when men truly
deſirous to know the truth, and of vpright meaning (I hope you belieue
Proteſtants to be ſuch, at leaſt, moſt of them) differ about the
ſenſe of Scripture, it is a ſigne, that ſuch places are not evident?
And ſeing, we now treat of a Point, which at leaſt, is neceſſary to be
knowen, whether or no it be neceſſary (otherwiſe we cannot be aſſured
that we want nothing neceſſary to ſalvation) it followes, that Scripture
is not evident in all things neceſſary to be knowen; and therfor we muſt
haue recourſe to a Living Judg. 2. Seing ſo many of thoſe whom you call
brethren, teach our Catholique Doctrine, whatſoever you object againſt vs,
makes no less againſt them. 3. Your ſaying, That Baptiſme is <hi>a
caſuall thing,</hi> and <hi>in the power of man to conferr,</hi> (though yet
many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants, hold Baptiſme to be neceſſary) is a prophane
ſpeech, as if God had not a moſt particular Providence in diſpoſing all
rhings for the good of his Elect, particularly in things neceſſary to
ſalvation. Why do you not likewiſe object againſt all Chriſtians, their
making the ſalvation of every one depend on the preaching of the Goſpell
(of <pb n="392" facs="tcp:59214:205"/>which our Saviour ſpoke when he alſo commanded
his Apoſtles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr Baptiſme (Matth: 28.19.) which you may alſo
ſay, <hi>is a caſuall thing, and in the power of man</hi> to doe, or omitt?
as if God could not be ſure how to order infallibly all events or effects,
vnless they fall out by neceſſity. Nay, I ſay more. Our God is ſo good,
and deſirous that all be ſaved, that if men did ſtrictly concurre and
cooperate with his holy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Grace, in all occaſions, things
would ſo fall out, as that mediatè or immediatè, proximè
or remotè, one way or other, there would never want ſufficient Meanes
for infants to be baptized. So farr is this matter from being a caſuall
thing! And ſtill we muſt conſider, that infants dying without baptiſme,
are deprived of ſalvation, not for the fault of thoſe who omitted to
Baptize them, nor properly for want of Baptiſme itſelf, but for Originall
ſin, once contracted and never aboliſhed, by that meanes and inſtrument,
which God hath appointed for that End and Effect; as he might in his Juſtice
haue left all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in their ſins, without providing for them a Redeemer,
according to the proceeding which he held with the apoſtating Angells; and
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Doctrine, That children dying without Baptiſme, cannot be
ſaved, implyes no cruelty, abſurdity, or ſtrangeness, to thoſe who
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve other Poynts of Chriſtian Faith: Eſpecially if we conſider, that
although they ſhall not enjoy felicity in Heaven, yet they ſhall lead their
life with much content, by contemplation, and alſo by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that
perhaps if their Creatour had granted them longer life, yea and procured them
to be baptized, they might haue dyed in actuall deadly ſinne, and haue bene
damned in Hell, with Poena Damni, &amp; Senſus, both of being deprived of the
beatificall Viſion, and of inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable torments of ſenſe; and what
greater abſurdity is it, that infants ſhould Miſſe of ſalvation, for
want of intention in the Miniſter, then if they had not bene in the
occaſion of not being baptized at all, by reaſon of ſome other
impediment? And therfor I ſee no reaſon, why we ſhould for ſuch caſes
of want of Intention in the Miniſter (or of due Forme or Matter) haue
recourſe to any extraordinary Meanes; which ſhould not be extraordinary,
but ordinary, if God did provide it, whenſoever the infant is not baptized,
vpon whatſoever occaſion or impediment, and ſo indeed Baptiſme ſhould
never be abſolutely neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beſides, ſeing there
can be no certainty of extraordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the matter will ſtill remaine
doubtfull, and objections muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſome other waie.</p>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:59214:205"/>
               <p n="62">62. But you will object, That at leaſt we differ from
Proteſtants in ſuſpending the ſalvation of infants, on the Baptizers
Intention.</p>
               <p n="63">63. Anſwer. I haue ſhewed, that ſome learned
Proteſtants of chief note, require the ſame intention which we doe; and
alſo that every iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious man will certainly judg, that there is no danger
of invalidity in Baptiſme for want of intention, but rather in reſpect of
the Matter or Forme; and yet not only the Proteſtant Church of England
teaches, that the Matter and Forme are neceſſary for Baptiſme, but alſo
divers other Proteſtants deliver the ſame Doctrine, as may be ſeene in
The Triple Cord (Pag: 457.) and the thing is evident of it ſelf to every one
who vnderſtands the termes of Matter and Forme. If men may be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for
their Actuall ſinnes, though they be ſuppoſed to be invincibly ignorant
of neceſſary or fundamentall points of Faith (as Potter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes) why
may not infants be deprived of Heaven for originall ſinne, though theire want
of Baptiſme be not immediatly voluntary to any?</p>
               <p n="64">64. Your laſt Objection (N. 69.) is againſt <hi>Our
making he Reall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Christ in the Euchariſt depend vpon the
caſualtyes of the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors true Prieſthood and intention, and yet
commanding men to belieue it for certaine that he is preſent, and to adore
the Sacrament which according to your Doctrine,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ought they can posſibly
know, may be nothing els, but a piece of bread, ſo expoſing them to the
danger of idolatry, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="65">65. Anſwer. Firſt: Who will not wonder, you ſhould
object to vs danger of idolatry, by reaſon of ſome particular caſe, or
application of a generall true Ground (which can be neither Hereſy, nor
formall ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry) while Proteſtants are expoſed to danger of Hereſy and
idolatry, and conſequently of damnation, by reaſon of the very generall
Ground, by which, their Actions ſhould be directed? Luther and Lutherans
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the Reall Preſence, and divers of their chiefeſt Writers
expreſſly teach, that Chriſt is to be adored in the Euchariſt. And
Kemnitius proves it by the ſeverall ſayings of the Saints, Auſtine,
Ambroſe, and Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen. The Reader may be pleaſed to ſee
Brierley (Tract: 2. Cap: 1. Sect: 3.) Seing then Zwinglians, Calviniſts,
Socinians, and all they who deny the Reall Preſence, hold the opinion of
Lutherans to be falſe, and that the Euchariſt for ſubſtance is but a
piece of bread; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Objection thoſe Lutherans expoſe
themſelves, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the danger of idolatry, and conſequently of
damnation; but alſo to certaine idolatry, if the Faith of Sacramentaryes be
certainly true, <pb n="394" facs="tcp:59214:206"/>as, themſelves hold it to be. On the
contrary ſide: If Chriſt be really and ſubſtantially preſent in the
Sacrament, they who deny both his Preſence, and Adoration, are Heretiks, and
expoſe themſelves to the danger of a ſin no leſſe haynous than
idolatry. For it is no less (if not more) injurious to deny that honour to any
perſon which is due to him, than it is to yeild greater reſpect than is
due; rather this latter is less grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous that that former; becauſe to
exibite due honour, is one of thoſe precepts which Divines call Affirmatiue,
and do not oblige for all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; but expreſſly to deny that honour which
is due to one, yea and avouch it not to be due, is ranked in the class of
Negatiue Precepts, which oblige for all places, tymes, and other
circumſtances. Thus we are not obliged to be at all tymes in act of adoring
God, but we are bound never to deny the ſupreme honour, which Divines call
Latria, to be due to his Divine Majeſty. If therfor Lutherans be Hererikes
and Idolaters, for adoring Chriſt in the Euchariſt, if it be only a piece
of bread; other Proteſtants ſhall be Heretikes, and as bad, or worſe,
than Idolaters, if indeed Chriſt, true God and man, be really preſent. The
difference then and doubtfullness among you, concernes Matter of Faith; but
that which you object to vs, concernes only matter of Fact. We are moſt
aſſured of this generall Ground; Chriſt is re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> preſent in the Conſecrated
Hoaſt; but it is not an Article of Faith, that this Hoaſt in particular is
Conſecrated, or, that that which ſeemes to be bread and wine, is indeed
ſuch. You ſay; <hi>We command men to belieue for certaine, that Chriſt is
preſent in the Euchariſt,</hi> but <hi>for certaine</hi> you ſpeake
againſt your conſcience, if you would haue the Reader to belieue, that we
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand men to belieue with certainty of Faith, that Chriſt is preſent in
this or that particular Hoaſt; though, vnless we haue ſome grounded
poſitiue reaſon to the contrary, we ought not poſitively to doubt; which
would be but an Act of imprudency, or perhaps vncharitableness, or injuſtice;
as it happens in a thouſand caſes, wherin we haue no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Faith,
or Metaphiſicall evidence, and yet it would be meere fooliſhness,
poſitively and practically to doubt of them: nor could there be in this
caſe any ſhadow of danger to committ formall, or culpable Idolatry.
Religion is a morall Uertue, and requires not, for its directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in particular
occaſions, the certainty of Faith, but is regulated by the vertue of
Prudence, which in our caſe doth moſt reaſonably judg, that Chriſt is
really preſent, in that Hoaſt, which we haue good reaſon to judge is
Conſecrated; and if there be no danger of formall idolatry, 
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59214:206"/>there can be no danger of damnation. But in the meane
tyme, you ſhould conſider, that by your fallible Faith, you can haue no
certainty, that Chriſt either, is, or is not preſent in the Euchariſt,
and ſo you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe yourſelf to the danger of a grievous ſin, by not
believing and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſt, if really he be preſent. Beſides; ſeing
you hold, that any errour againſt Divine Revelation, is damnable in itſelf,
no man muſt read Scripture, or ſeeke to find the ſenſe therof, leaſt
he chance to miſſe of the true meaning, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo expoſe himſelf to
danger, of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting a thing damnable in itſelf. You blame <hi>Charity
Maintained</hi> becauſe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue he would not haue vs ſubject to any
vncertainty in matters belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to ſalvation; and yet now you object
againſt all Catholiques, that they adore our Saviour, when they are not
abſolutely certaine that he is preſent; though indeed, if paſſion did
not blind you, you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Lutherans only, who belieue, that bread
remaynes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for if Chriſt be not really preſent, as you hold for
certaine he is not, they adore that which is nothing els but a piece of bread:
wheras we Catholikes believing that bread doth not remayne, cannot poſſibly
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our intentions, and Adoration to bread, but to Chriſt himſelf, and
ſo the moſt that can be imagined will only be this; that we adore Chriſt,
thinking he is where he is not, our intention being ſtill carried to him a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
not to any Creature; which if you will hold for true idolatry, you muſt
condemne all good Chriſtians of idolatry who adore God as He is in Heaven,
Earth, and everie where, though in the opinion of your fellow Socinians He be
really and ſubſtantially, only in Heaven. Even Dr. Taylor in his Liberty of
Propheſying (Pag: 258. Numb: 16.) ſpeakes home to the purpoſe of freeing
Catholiks from all danger of idolatry, in theſe words: <hi>idolatry is a
forſaking the true God, and in giving the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>vine Worſhip to a Creature or to an idoll, that
is, to an imaginary God, who hath no foundation in eſſence or exiſtence:
And is that kinde of ſuperſtition, which by Divines is called
ſuperſtition of an vndue object: Now it is evident that the Object of their
Adoration (that which is repreſented to them in their mindes, their thoughts
and purpoſes, and by which God principally, if not ſolely takes eſtimate
of humane actions) in the bleſſed Sacrament, is the only true and eternall
God, hypoſtatically ioyned with his holy humanity which humanity they belieue
actually preſent vnder the veile of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall ſignes: And if they
thought him not bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they are ſo farre from worſhipping the bread in
this caſe that themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves profeſſe it to be idolatry to doe ſoe,
which is a demonstration that their ſoule hath nothing in it that is
idololatricall. If their confidence and fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <pb n="396" facs="tcp:59214:207"/>opinion hath engaged them vpon ſo great miſtake (as without doubt
is hath) yet the will hath nothing in it, but what is a great enemy to
idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Et nihil ardet in inferno niſi propria voluntas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="66">66. Having thus anſwered and retorted the Objections
wherin you ſeeme to triumph, it is tyme to goe forward in proving the
neceſſity of a Living infallible Judg.</p>
               <p n="67">67. Fourthly then, I reſume the Argument of
<hi>Charity. Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Chap: 2. N. 23. Pag: 67.) There was no
Scripture for about two thouſand yeares from Adam to Moyſes: And againe for
about two thouſand yeares more, from Moyſes to Chriſt our Lord, Holy
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was only among the people of Iſraël; and yet there were
Gentils indued with divine Faith, as appeares in Job and his frends. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
during ſo many ages, the Church alone was the inſtructor of the faithfull,
by meanes of Tradition. The Church alſo of Chriſt was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the
Scriptures of the New Teſtament, which were not written inſtantly, nor all
at one tyme, but ſucceſſively, vpon ſeverall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and ſome
after the deceaſe of moſt of the Apoſtles: And after they were written,
they were not preſently knowne to all Churches; and afterwardes ſome were
doubted of, &amp;c:</p>
               <p n="68">68. To this Argument (Pag: 100. N. 123.) You anſwer,
that it <hi>is juſt as if I ſhould ſay, Yorke is not in my way from
Oxford to London, therfor Briſtell is: Or a dog is not a horſe: Therfor he
is a man. As if God had no other wayes of revealing himſelf to men, but only
Scripture, and an infallible Church,</hi> wheras S. Paul telleth vs, that men
may know God by his workes, and that they had the Law written in their harts.
<hi>Either of theſe ways might make ſome faithfull men without either
neceſſity of Scripture, or Church.</hi> To this purpoſe you cite alſo
S. Chryſoſtome, Iſid: Pelus: and S. Paul, (Heb: 1.1.)</p>
               <p n="69">69. You could not but ſee the weakness of this your
Anſwer, ſince you know that we ſpeake not of extraordinary caſes or
concurrence, but of the ordinary Meanes, which God in his Holy Providence is
wont to vſe, helping one man by the miniſtery of another, in governing,
teaching, preaching, and the like, and making good that truth of the Apoſtle,
ſides ex auditu. Faith comes by hearing. Which only way of teaching, and
Tradition, could ſerue to beget Faith for that tyme wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no Scripture,
either of the Old, or new Law was written. Will you take vp the Apoſtle for
ſaying, Fides ex auditu, and tell him, that there be other Meanes beſide
hearing, to beget Faith, as the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <pb n="397" facs="tcp:59214:207"/>in mens

Queſtion, to what purpoſe do you through your whole Booke, ſeeke to

neceſſity of the Churches Declarations, and Traditions? Since, when all is
done, you may be told in your owne words, That without neceſſity of
Scripture or Church, there are other Meanes to produce Faith, and ſo all your
Arguments will be like this; Yorke is not in my way &amp;c: A dog is not a
horſe &amp;c: By this Meanes, one may with the Old Heretikes Manichees,
Valentinians, Cerdoniſts, Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſts, and the new Libertines, reject
Scripture, and not be <hi>ſubject to the letter, but that they ought to

it;</hi> Which you muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in the Ordinary way. Vnless you haue a
mynde to contradict your ſelf, and ſay; That abſolutely there are no
other poſſible meanes to attaine Divine Faith, than by the Seripture and
the Church, as a neceſſary introduction to it. Yourſelf therfor muſt
anſwer your owne ſlighting Inſtances. For, if in the ordinary courſe,
and as I may ſay, without a kind of Miracle, it were true, that the way from
Oxford to Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were either Yorke, or Briſtoll, or that a dog muſt be
either a horſe, or aman; were not theſe conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces very Good? But Yorke
is not; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for Briſtoll is; But a dogg is not a horſe; therfor he is a
man? Now, the Ordinary neceſſary meanes to produce Faith, being either
Scripture, or the Church; if we ſubſume; But it is not Scripture, (which is
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for that tyme, when there was no Scripture) it clearly followes;
Therfor it is the Church, which I Hope, you will not deny to haue bene
infallible in the Apoſtles tyme, before Scripture was written; and ſo your
examples proue againſt none but yourſelf.</p>
               <p n="70">70. We muſt ſtill remember, that Faith being the Gift
of God, we cannot belieue, except in caſes wherin God by his Eternall
Providence hath decreed to affoard vs his particular Grace for that end; which
he is not wont to doe, vnless the conditions by Him preſcribed, be
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Since therfor the Church hath bene appointed, as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Meanes to attaine Faith, we ought not to promiſe ourſelves the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
aſſiſtance of Grace, neceſſary for exerciſing an Act of true Faith 
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59214:208"/>except vnder condition of hearing and ſubmitting to
that Church, and not by conſideration only of Gods creatures, or by the Law
written in our harts, or by extraordinary enthuſiaſmes, private ſpirits,
and the like. If it had bene Gods holy pleaſure to require of men to belieue
only that <hi>God is, and that he is a Rewarder of thoſe that ſeeke
Him,</hi> or ſome other few Articles, he would haue affoarded his
ſufficient ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Grace to belieue thoſe Points, as alſo to
loue Him, repent of our ſins, and attaine ſalvation by believing thoſe
Pointes only (for as much as would belong to Faith:) But de facto it falls out
otherwiſe, and we are to belieue many other Points, as yourſelf pretend to
teach (Pag: 133. N. 13. where you ſay, That they who ſhould belieue the
ſayd Article, That <hi>God is and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeeke
him,</hi> (Heb: 6.11.) might be rewarded, <hi>not with bringing them immediatly
to ſalvation without Chriſt but with bringing them first to Faith in
Chriſt, and ſo to ſalvation:</hi> Which you endeavour to proue by the
ſtory of Cornelius (Act: 10.) of whom you ſay (Pag: 134.) <hi>If he had
refuſed to bel euein Chriſt after the ſufficient Revelation of the
Goſpell to him and Gods will to haue him belieue it, he that was accepted
before, would not haue continued accepted ſtill,</hi> becauſe one of the
conditions which Chriſt requires for <hi>remisſion of ſins, and
ſalvation from him, is, that we belieue what he has revealed, when it is
ſufficiently declared, to haue bene revealed by him.</hi> This confirmes what
I ſayd, that God doth not giue Grace to Belieue, Hope, and Loue, except vpon
thoſe conditions which he appoints and requires, which now is not only to
belieue ſome one Article, or to attaine Faith by the mere conſideration of
Gods creatures, or by the Law written in our harts, or by immediate
extraordinary lights, but by the Miniſtery of the Church; and therfor
(Epheſ: 4.11.12.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Paſtours and Doctours are ſayd to
be given to the conſummation of the Saints, vnto the worke of the
Miniſterie, vnto the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</q> Which declares,
that men cannot be made members of the Body of Chriſt, but by the Miniſtery
of Paſtours and Doctours: And even thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants who rely vpon the

given but when the Churches Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery precedes as an Introduction, or, as

(which <pb n="399" facs="tcp:59214:208"/>was before Scripture, and from which we receaue
it) muſt be the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary meanes, in the ordinary courſe which God
hath appointed to produce Faith, and decide Controverſyes in Religion, and
conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, muſt be infallible according to your owne Doctrine (Pag: 35.
N. 7.) that the <hi>meanes to decide Controverſyes in Faith, and Religion,
muſt be indued with an vniverſall infallibility in whatſoever it
propoundeth for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth. For if it may be falſe in any one thing of

(Part: 1. Chap: 2. N. 23. Pag: 69.) If Proteſtants will haue Scripture alone
for their Judge or Rule, let them firſt produce ſome Text of Scripture,
affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that by the entring therof, infallibility went out of the
Church.</p>
               <p n="73">73. To this you anſwer (Pag: 104. N. 138.) In theſe
words: <hi>As no Scripture affirmeth, that by the entring of it, infallibility
went out of the Church, ſo neither do we, neither haue we any need to do
ſo. But we ſay, that it continued in the Church even togeather with the
Scriptures, ſo long as Chriſt and his Apoſtles were living, and then
departed: God in his Providence having provided a plaine and infallilde Rule,
to ſupply the defect of Living and infallible Guides. Gertainly, if your
cauſe were good, ſo great a wit as yours is, would deviſe better
Arguments to maintaine it. We can ſhew no Scripture afſirming infallibility
to haue gone out of the Church; therfore it is infallible. Some what like to
his diſcourſe, that ſaid; it could not be proved out of Scripture, that
the King of Sweden was dead, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is still Living. Me thinks in all
reaſon, you that chaleng privileges and exemption from the condition of men,
which is to be ſubject to errour; you that by vertue of this privilege
vſurpe Authority over mens conſciences, ſhould produce your
Letter-patents from the King of Heaven, and ſhew ſome express warrant for
this Authority you take vpon you; otherweſe you know, the Rule is, vbi
contrarium non manifeſtè probatur, preſumitur pro
liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="74">74. This Anſwer is eaſily confuted. Firſt, I muſt
returne it vpon yourſelf, with thankes for your voluntary express grant,
<hi>That no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture afſirmes, that by entring of it, infallibility went
out of the Church.</hi> Remember your owne ſaying; that there are only two
Principles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Chriſtians; Reaſon, and Scripture: Seing then it is
evident, that meere naturall Reaſon cannot determine any thing in this
matter, and that you grant it cannot be proved by Scripture, that infallibility
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59214:209"/>went out of the Church by the entring of Scripture, what
remaines, but that you haue no proofe at all for it? And, ſince that you
direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, infallibility to haue continued for ſome tyme in the Church,
even togeather with the Scriptures, and that neither by reaſon, nor
Scripture, you can proue that it ever departed from Her; we muſt of
neceſſity conclude, that ſhe ſtill enjoyes that priviledge, moſt
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for deciding controverſyes belonging to infallible Chriſtian
faith. You ſay, <hi>God hath provided a plaine and infallible Rule, to
ſupply the defect of living and infallible Guides.</hi> But we haue proved
the contrary, That Scripture is not plaine in all Points belonging to Faith;
and though it were ſo, yet yourſelf confess in this place, that
infallibility in the Church, may ſtand with the ſufficiency and plaines of
Scripture; and therfore you cannot inferr; ſcripture is ſufficient;
therfore the Church is not infallible. You teach (Pag: 101. N. 126.) That
though <hi>all the neceſſary parts of the Goſpell be contained in every
one of the foure Goſpells, yet they which had all the Bookes of the New
Teſtament, had nothing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; for it was not ſuperfluous, but
profitable, that the ſame thing ſhould be ſayd divers tymes, and be
teſlifyed, by divers witneſſes.</hi> Therfore the Teſtimony of the
Church, if ſhe were ſuppoſed to be infallible, might be profitable,
although Scripture were cleare and ſufficient. Proteſtants pretend, that we
can proue matters belonging to Faith, only by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Wherfore you muſt
either proue by ſome plaine Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that infallibility dyed, as I
may ſay, with the Apoſtles, or never affirme herafter any ſuch
groundless, voluntary, and pernicious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. From Scripture we learne,

<q rend="margQuotes">that with out repentance are the gifts
of God.</q> (Rom: 11.29) And it is an Axiome of naturall Reaſon, Melior eſt
conditio poſſidentis. God once beſtowed vpon the Church, the gift of
infallibility; and therfore without ſome evident poſitiue proofe, you are
not to depriue her of it: And we are not obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any other
Argument, except to plead Poſſeſſion, which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take from vs
without ſome evident proofe to the contrary; And you being the Actor, and we
the Defendents, not wee, but you muſt prove; and performe what you exact of
vs, to ſhew ſome express warrant &amp;c: though it be alſo moſt true
that we haue great plenty of convincing proofes for the infallibility of Gods
Church.</p>
               <p n="75">75. As for your Inſtance about the King of Sweden, I
belieue you will looſe your jeaſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhall haue asked whether this
were not a good Argument; we can know by Scripture alone, whether the King of
Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <pb n="401" facs="tcp:59214:209"/>be aliue or dead; but we know by Scripture, he
was once Living, and know not by any Scripture that he is dead: Therfore, for
ought we know, he is aliue; and ſo your example returnes vpon yourſelf;
that ſeing you know by Scripture infallibility to haue bene once in the
Church, and that by no Scripture, (which with you muſt be the only proofe in
this caſe) you know, that it ever departed from Her, you muſt belieue that
ſtill ſhe enjoyes it. As for vs, we challeng no Priviledges, but ſuch as
were granted by our Saviour to his Church, and which we proue by the ſame
Arguments, wherby the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors proue their
Authority, (as ſhall be ſhewed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) and the Rule, Ubi contrarium
manifeſtè non probatur, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumitur pro libertate, is profanely
applyed to our preſent caſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin it is an vnſpeakable benefit to haue
our liberty, not taken away, but moderated, directed, and elevated to the End
of Eternall Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyness. If in any caſe, certainly in this, that ſaying,
Licentia omnes ſumus deteriores, is moſt true; as lamentable experience
teaches in ſo many Hereſyes, and ſo implacable contentions of Heretikes
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, by reaſon of the liberty which every one preſumes to
take in interpreting Holy Scripture: And for avoiding ſo great an
inconvenience and miſcheife, it is neceſſary to acknowledg ſome
infallible Living Judg, and ſo your Rule for Liberty, being rightly applyed,
proves againſt yourſelf: And the Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once confeſſedly
enjoyed infallibility, I muſt returne againſt you your owne words: Me
thinkes in all Reaſon, you that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to take away Priviledges once
granted, by God himſelf, for the Eternall Good of ſoules, ſhould produce
ſome exprress warrant for this bold attempt; eſpecially it being a Rule,
Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legia ſunt amplianda; chiefly, when they proceed from a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Power, and are helped by that Dictate of Reaſon, Melior eſt conditio
poſſidentis. And in the meane tyme, you are hee, who breake that Rule, Ubi
contrarium non manifeſtè probatur, praeſumitur pro libertate, by
pretending, that men are obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Reaſon, though ſeeming never
ſo certaine and evident, to the contents of Scripture, which yet you teach,
not to be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and certainly, but only probably, true: Againſt which
is your owne ſaying, Praeſumitur pro libertate, vbi contrarium non
manifeſtè probatur, as it happens in your fallible and only 
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:59214:210"/>probable Faith, which cannot be manifeſtly proved to be
true; for if it could be ſo proved, Chriſtian Faith ſhould be
abſolutely certaine, and not only probable: And ſo, continually you are
framing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in favour of your Adverſary.</p>
               <p n="76">76. I will not here looſe tyme in examining your
ſaying (Pag: 101. N. 126.) <hi>The Bookes of Scripture, which were receyved
by thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved foweſt, had as much of the Doctrine of
Chriſtianity in them, as they all had which were receyved by any; all the
neceſſary parts of the Goſpell, being contayned in every one of the
Goſpells.</hi> Are not the divers profitable things which are contained in
ſome of the Goſpells, and omitted in others, part of the Doctrine of
Chriſtianity, taught by the Apoſtles to Chriſtians? Beſides, what can
you vnderſtand by theſe words (Pag: 101. N. 125.) <hi>For ought appeares by
your reaſons, the Church never had infallibility?</hi> And yet <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> ſpoke of the Church of Chriſt, as it was before any
Scripture of the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was written; which Church He proved to be
infallible, becauſe at that tyme there could be no other infallible Rule or
Judg, which is a cleare a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d convincing Reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ſo I hope it appeares by
his Reaſons that the Church once had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</p>
               <p n="77">77. Sixthly: You haue theſe words (Pag: 115. N. 156)
<hi>Nothing can challeng our belief, but what hath deſcended to vs from
Chriſt by Originall and vniverſall Tradition: Now nothing but Scripture
hath thus deſcended to vs. Therfore nothing but Scripture can challeng our
belief.</hi> Now I ſaie in like manner; it is neither delivered in Scripture,
nor otherwiſe hath deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to vs from Chriſt by Originall and
Vniverſall Tradition, that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not at this tyme joyned with ſome
infallible Living Judg, as once it was; or that the Church was ever deveſted
of that Authority, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, which it had; or that God had provided a
plaine and infallible Rule, to ſupply the defect of a Living and infallible
Guide, (as you ſay) or that Scripture alone without Tradition, is the Rule of
Faith: Therfore none of theſe Points can challeng our belief. My ſaying
hath bene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hertofore, and yourſelf confess, that you do not proue out
of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that with the entring of it, infallibility went out of the
Church; but contrarily, that they did remayne togeather for a tyme.</p>
               <p n="78">78. Seaventhly: I take an Argument from your owne
Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that Scripture is not a materiall Object of Faith, or an Article
which we belieue: To which Maior, I ſubſume thus: But that Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by
aſſenting to which alone, I belieue all other Points, muſt it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf 
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:59214:210"/>be aſſented to, and believed (for how can I believe
any thing for an Authority which I do not belieue?) Therfore Scripture alone
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Meanes by which I come to belieue all other Points. And ſeing
no other ordinary Meanes to produce Faith, can be aſſigned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Scripture, and the Church, we muſt inferr, that the Church is the ordinary
Meanes to produce Faith, and decide Controverſyes in Religion; and
conſequently even according to your owne Doctrine, ſhe muſt be
infallible; Otherwiſe, as you ſay of the Meanes to decide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſyes,
(Pag: 35. N. 7.) <hi>We can yield vnto it, but a wavering and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

that there ſhall be a Church which never erreth in ſome Points, becauſe

that according to Potter, God hath promiſed ſo much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly, yea and

contrary Doctrine I do at no hand belieue to be a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hereſy?</hi> Is
it not a damnble Hereſy to belieue that Chriſt can faile of his promiſe?
Beſides, ſince theſe Proteſtants profess, and you alſo conceaue, that
God hath promiſed the Church ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <pb n="404" facs="tcp:59214:211"/>be
aſſiſted, ſo far as not to erre in Fundamentall Points; I aske, whether
the Church can reſiſt ſuch an Aſſiſtance or Motion of God, or no?
Whatſoever you anſwer for Proteſtants, and your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, will ſerue for
an Anſwer to this very Objection of reſiſtibility, or
irreſiſtibility, which you make againſt vs, who defend the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of the Church, and abſolute certaine Aſſiſtance, that ſhe ſhall
never erre in matters belonging to Faith and Religion. But to returne.</p>
               <p n="80">80. Seing the Church cannot periſh, ſhe cannot faile
in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Points; and ſeing alſo you confess, that it is
impoſſible to determine in particular what Poynts be Fundamentall; (and we
ſee other Proteſtants could never yet agree in giving a Catalogue of ſuch
Points) we muſt either belieue that ſhe can faile in no Points at all, or
elſe we cannot be ſure, that ſhe failes not in Fundamentall Articles.
This granted, I go a ſtep further, and ſay; that ſeing in the ordinary
courſe of Gods Providence, we are not taught by immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
Enthuſiaſmes, or the like, but by the Miniſtery of the Church, it
followes, that God hath indued and adorned her with ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives and
Notes, that all who will cooperate with Gods Grace, may attaine the knowledg of
Her, and be able to joyne themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to Her Communion, and abandon all other
falſe Synagogues or Congregations. Otherwiſe it is all one to make the true
Church inviſible, or vndiſcernable from other Communityes, and to ſay
there is no true Church at all, in order to any fruit, which faithfull people
can take or receiue from Her; and infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Fundamentall Points, which,
even Proteſtants grant Her, will ſerue to no purpoſe at all. It is your
owne ſaying, (Pag: 105. N. 139.) <hi>No Church can poſſibly be fit to be
a Gaide, but only a Church of ſome certaine denomination.</hi> And what
comfort can it be to our ſoules as Whitaker ſayd, That Chriſts Church
never ſhall faile, if we cannot know where that Church is, nor that there be
Meanes and Notes, to ſhew her vnto vs? Neither can any be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obey
her Commands, follow her Doctrine, heare her preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, frequent her
Sacraments &amp;c: vnless they can be ſure to find her. (Rom: 10. Verſ:
14.15.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">How ſhall they belieue him whom they
haue not heard? And how ſhall they heare without a Preacher? But how ſhall
they preach vnless they be ſent?</q> Behold preaching, in the ordinary
courſe, neceſſary to Faith, and lawfull Miſſion neceſſary 
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:59214:211"/>to Preaching! All which can belong only to the viſible

peace, they muſt haue auditours, who muſt be knowne, and theſe muſt
know where their Preachers are to be found. Even Calvin (Lib: 4. Inſt: Chap:

God, who could make men perfect in a moment, yet will not do it but by the

as Paul tell vs</hi> (Rom: 10.17.) <hi>That Faith comes by hearing. Although
the Power of God be not tyed to outward meanes, yet he hath tyed vs to the
ordinary way of teaching.</hi> Wherby we ſee, that even thoſe who talke
ſo much of the private Spirit, yet profess that it is not given without the
Miniſtery of the Church, as I ſaied above. Fulk alſo (<hi>in his Anſwer

Cartwright (in his ſecond Reply, Part: 1. Pag: 381. circa medium)
main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth, that the people periſh, where there be no preachers, although
there be Readers. And that by bare reading, ordinarily there is no
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, no Faith. Let Proteſtants marke this. If Scripture were of
itſelf evident in all Points of Faith, it were ſufficient to reade it; and
people need not periſh for want of preaching, but Faith and ſalvation might
be had without it, by only reading Scripture.</p>

Corollaryes are manifeſtly deduced. Firſt: That the true Church, which all

the inſtrument of the Goſpell, and Meanes of hearing; and that God hath
tyed vs to this ordinary way. And what els can Fulk, and other Proteſtants
meane. For it were but foolery to ſay, That an vnknowne <hi>Miniſtery is an
eſſentiall Mark of the true Church?</hi> Or that ſalvation
<hi>ſpringeth in a preaching</hi> not known where to be found, and is
<hi>ſhut vp with ceaſing of it?</hi> Or that <hi>truth cannot be continued:
in the world without the</hi> miniſtery of Preachers? Or of any ſuch
ſayings?</p>
               <p n="82">82. Secondly: It followes, that ſeing there muſt
alwayes be a knowne particular Church which cannot periſh, that is in your
Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, cannot erre in Fundamentall Points, that knowen Church muſt be
infallible abſolutely in all Points Fundamentall, and not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall. For,
if we did conceiue ſhe could erre in any one Point of Faith, we could not
rely on her Authority in any other; which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo grant, as we haue lately
ſhewed; and (Pag: 105. N. 139.) you ſpeake directly to our preſent
purpoſe in theſe words: <hi>We vtterly deny, the Church to be an Infallible
Guide in Fundamentalls; for to ſay ſo were to oblige ouerſelves to find
ſome certaine ſociety of men, of whom we might be certaine, that they
neither do, nor can erre in Fundamentalls, nor in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what is Fundament
all: And conſequently to make any Church an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Guide in
Fundamentalls, would be to make it Infallible in all things which ſhe
propoſes and requires to be believed.</hi> To which Aſſertion of yours, I
ſubſume thus: But there muſt be alwayes a viſible Church diſcernable
from all falſe Congregations, which Church cannot erre in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Points of Faith: Therfore there muſt alwayes be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable Church,
<hi>Infallible in all things ſhe propoſes, and requires to be
believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:59214:212"/>
               <p n="83">83. Thirdly: It is deduced: That even according to the
moſt rigid Proteſtants, God doth not ordinarily affoard his Grace for
bringing men to Faith by the only conſideration of his Creatures, or by the
Law written in our harts, or by other ſecet meanes, but by teaching,
prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and the like. By which conſideration, we haue not only confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
what you ſayd, (Pag: 100. N. 123.) that men might be made <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
without either necesſity of Scripture; or Church;</hi> but that alſo is
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, which you Object (Pag: 356. N. 38.) where you aske; <hi>Why
ſhould not I be made a true and Ortodoxe Chriſtian, by believing all the
Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt, though I cannot deriue my deſcent from a Perpetuall
Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that believed it before me?</hi> To which demand, the Anſwer
is very eaſy, and convincing, to all ſuch as againſt the Pelagians,
belieue true Chriſtian Faith to be the Gift of God, and producible only by
his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Grace and Inſpiration, which he gives only by the meanes
appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Holy providence, that is, Preaching, Teaching, and
Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of his viſible Church, as we haue heard Calvin ſaying, <hi>God
inſpires Faith, by Meanes of the Goſpell, as Paul tells vs, that Faith
comes by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi> And if any will take vpon them, to belieue by force of
naturall Reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or by Revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Scripture, vnderſtood by their owne
wit a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſhall be ſure to be miſerably deceyved, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
be far enough from exerciſing any true Act of Divine ſupernaturall Faith,
neceſſary to Salvation. Now the Church by Divine Inſtitution cannot
conſiſt without a Succeſſion of Biſhops, from the Apoſtles to the
worlds end, and therfore God gives not his Aſſiſtance for the production
of true Faith, except by the Miniſtery of ſuch a Church, as is governed by
Biſhops; though no man denyes, but that he might haue done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, by
ordaining and ordering another courſe of his holy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; as
Proteſtants will grant that God might haue ſaved men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture,
though in their opinion de facto he will not do it, but that it, even taken
alone, is not only ſufficient, but neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="84">84. Fourthly I deduce; That, the Premiſes conſidered,
it may juſtly appeare to every Chriſtian very ſtrange, that (Pag: 150. N.
41.) having cited theſe words of <hi>Charity Maintained; If the Church be not
an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teacher, why are we commanded to ſeeke, to heare, to obey the
Church?</hi> You would anſwer in this manner: <hi>For commands to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eke the Church, I haue not yet
met with any, and I belieue, you, if you were to ſhew them, would be
yourſelf to ſeeke. But yet if you could produce ſome ſuch, we 
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:59214:213"/>might ſeeke the Church to many good purpoſes, without
ſuppoſing her a guide Infallible. And then for hearing and obeying the
Church, I would faine know, whether none may be heard and obeyed, but thoſe
that are infallible? Whether particular churches, Governours, Paſtors,
Parents, be not to be heard and obeyed? Or whether all theſe be infallible? I
wonder you will thruſt vpon vs ſo often theſe worne out objections,
without taking notice of their Anſwers.</hi> But all this is clearly
confuted, by what hath bene ſayd already. And 1. What Chriſtian would not
wonder, as I ſayd, to heare you affirme, that you <hi>haue not met with any
commands to ſeeke the Church?</hi> If the Miniſtery of the Church be the
ordinary Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to attaine Faith, and, as even yourſelf confess, a
neceſſary Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to it; if Faith come by hearing; if in Her only we
con expect to find true Paſtours and Doctours; if it be neceſſary to know
her, as Calvin confeſſes; if Faith, remiſſion of ſins, and
ſalvation cannot be had except by her Meanes; I beſeech you, are not
theſe ſufficient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to ſeeke Her, or rather may we not call this
command of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her, either the command of Commands, or els a command
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in all the commands, of Believing, Hoping, Loving, Repenting and
ſeeking ſalvation, ſeing theſe cannot be had, but by ſeeking, and
finding her, and is it not evident, that if we be obliged to attaine an End, we
are bound to ſeeke out the Meanes, which are neceſſary for that End? Nay
do you not ſpeake inconſequently to yourſelf, while you deny not, but
that there is a command to heare and obey the Church, and yet deny that there
is any command to ſeeke her? It ſeemes you are indeed a child of Adam, who
would hide yourſelf from God, and from thoſe Superiours whom he hath
appointed to guide and governe you, in his place. If one belieue that there are
ſome, whom by Gods appointment he is to heare and obey, in order to Heaven,
and Happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is it not his part, or hath he not a moſt ſtrict
obligation, to do his beſt endeavour, to find out ſuch perſons, or ſuch
a Congregation? But, ſay you, <hi>we might ſeeke the Church, to many good
purpoſes, without ſuppoſing Her a Guide Infallible.</hi> No doubt, but,
ſpeaking in generall, we may ſeeke one without ſuppoſing him to be a
Guide Infallible, as one may ſeeke ſome loſt ſheepe, ſuch as you are,
to bring them from Hereſy to the Church, and from Socinianiſme to true
Reaſon, (Which will not be guided by itſelf, but by a Superiour Maiſter,
appoynted by God) without ſuppoſing them to be Infallible Guides. But when
we ſeeke a Church, from which alone we con learne with certainty required to 
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:59214:213"/>Faith, what Scripture is Canonicall and all Points of
Faith neceſſary to ſalvation (neither of which we can learne from
Scripture) we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Church to be Infallible. Thus all they
who belieue the Scripture to be a Rule of Faith, (whether totall, or not)
conſequently belieue it to be infallible: And (Pag: 35. N. 7.) you confess,
that <hi>the Meanes to decide controverſyes in Faith and Religion, must be
indued with an Vniverſall Infallibility in whatſoever it propoundeth for a
Divine Truth.</hi> And if the Church were not Infallible, one of thoſe many
good purpoſes which you fancy to yourſelf in ſeeking Her, would be, that
we ſhould certainly expoſe ourſelves to danger, of being perniciouſly
deceived, in matters concerning Eternall Salvation; ſeing, as I ſayd, we
haue no other certaine and ſufficient Meanes, to belieue ſcripture, and
other Articles of Faith. And now, I beſeech you, tell me, whether we heare
and obey all particular Churches, Governours, Paſtours, and Parents, as
Judges of Controverſyes in Faith and Religion, and the only Meanes to
propoſe to vs all Points neceſſary to be believed? Certainly, if we were
obliged to heare and obey them in ſo eminent a degree, (as we are not) we
ought alſo to belieue them to be infallible, even according to your owne
Aſſertion repeated in divers places of your Book. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you and other
Proteſtants will be ſtill thruſting vpon vs this worne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Objection,
without taking notice of the Anſwer which hath bene ſo often given, and
which ſhewes, that your Objection tumes againſt yourſelf. And as for our
obligation to ſeeke the Church, none can ſpeake more home, than Dr. Field,
one of the chiefeſt Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of England (in his <hi>Treatiſe
of the Church,</hi> in <hi>his Epiſtle Dedicatory to the Lor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Communion, follow her directions, and reſt in her judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="85">85. Fiftly; I know not whether you ſpeake more vntruly,
or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciouſly, or (giue me leaue to ſpeake truth) more ridiculouſly,
when (Pag: 105. N. 139.) you ſay to <hi>Charity Maintayned: You muſt know
there is a wide difference between, being infallible in Fundamentalls, and
being an infallible Guide even in Fundamentalls. Dr. Potter ſayes, That the
Church is the former; that is, There ſhall be ſome men in the world, while
the world laſts, which erre not in Fundamentals; for otherwiſe there
ſhould <pb n="410" facs="tcp:59214:214"/>be no Church: For to ſay the Church, while it
is the Church may erre in Fundamentalls, implies contradiction, and is all one
as to ſay, The Church, while it is the Church, may not be the Church. So that
to ſay, that the Church is infallible in Fundamentalls, ſignifyes no more
but this, There ſhall be a Church in the world for ever.</hi> Thus you: And
thus the ſons of men, and children of darkness, take pleaſure to ſeeme
witty by jeaſting ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiouſly in things belonging to God. The Church
cannot erre in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Ponts, becauſe if ſhe erre in ſuch Points,
ſhe is no more a Church. Why ſay you not thus? All men are infallibly true,
becauſe if they erre, they ceaſe to be true, in that wherin they erre.
<hi>Mr. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi> is immortall, and cannot dy, becauſe if he dy, he
is no more <hi>Mr. Chillingworth;</hi> and happy had it bene for him, and
others ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by his ſophiſtry, ſi non fuiſſet natus homo ille.
Thus alſo you may ſay: That God, when he threatned and decreed, that Adam
ſhould be mortall, and dye, if he tranſgreſſed his command, at the
ſame tyme even after his tranſgreſſion he was immortall and could not
dye, becauſe if he died, he ſhould no more be Adam. To be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, in
common ſence, ſignifyes a certainty not to dye, and not ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly,
that if he dy, he doth exiſt no more; and ſo not to exiſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes the
direct contrary of being immortall, and ſuppoſes one to be mortall; and
therfore to ſay, The Church is infallible, becauſe if ſhe erre, ſhe is
no more a Church, comes to this, that ſhe is fallible, which is directly
contrary to infallible. For, as we ſayd of immortality, ſo in proportion,
infallibility muſt ſignify an aſſurance not to erre; and the Church to
be infallible in Fundamentall Points, muſt ſignify, that ſhe cannot erre
in them, and ſo not looſe her being by ſuch errour, which is plainly
oppoſite to your ſaying, that ſhe may erre, and therby ceaſe to be. You
erre therfore, in not diſtinguiſhing between Actum primum and ſecundum,
or Potentiam and Actum, as Philoſophers ſpeake. To ſay, a Church is
infallible, or cannot erre or be deſtroyed, ſignifyes ſome antecedent,
either extrinſecall or intrinſecall, Principle, or Power, preſerving Her
in ſuch manner, as that ſuch a Principle, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not actually conſiſt with
errour. And therfor you ſpeake not like a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, in ſaying, The
Church is infallible in Fundamentalls, <hi>that is, There ſhall be ſome men
in the world while the world laſts, which erre not in Fundamentalls,</hi>
paſſing ab actuad potentiam, and proving that men are infallible, becauſe
de facto they erre not, wheras men may chance not to erre, and yet not be
infallible. You haue heard Whitaker <pb n="411" facs="tcp:59214:214"/>ſaying, <hi>We
beleeue to the comfort of our ſoules, that Chriſts Church hath continued,
and never ſhall faile ſo long as the world indureth, and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a
prophane Hereſy to teach otherwiſe.</hi> What comfort, I pray, can it be to
ſoules, that the Church may erre in Fundamentall Points, yet ſo, as ſhe
remaynes no more a Church; which Whitaker <hi>accounts a prophane
Hereſy?</hi> Every one conceaves infallibility to be a favour, and
Priviledge? You tell vs the plaine contrary; That infallibility in the Church,
for the moſt principall and neceſſary Points of Faith, doth not
ſignify, that ſhe may not erre in them, but that if ſhe erre, ſhe
muſt inevitably periſh, or dye by ſuch a damnable errour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as
it were the Divells martyr, by dying for ſo bad a cauſe: Which ſurely is
no favour or Priviledge; eſpecially if we call to mynd, an other Doctrine of
yours, that Errours not Fundamentall are compatible with the Being of a Church,
which is a greater favour than to be deſtroyed: And therfore how can
infallibility in Fundamentall Points, in your way of explication, (that if
ſhe erre in ſuch Points ſhe ceaſeth to be a Church) be a Priviledg or
Favour, ſeing no body will ſay, that falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and errour in Points not
Fundamentall, which yet deſtroy not the Church, are favours? Other men
conceaue, that theſe Propoſitions are convertible: Whoſoever is
infallible, cannot erre; and, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cannot erre, is infallible: But you
contrary to all other mens Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, ſay the Church is infallible, becauſe
ſhe may erre damnably and deſperatly, and therby looſe her Being.</p>
               <p n="86">86. When Proteſtants teach, That the Church cannot
periſh, but is infallible in Fundamentall Points, they make a difference
between Points Fundamentall, and not Fundamentall; and teach, That ſhe may
faile and de facto hath fayled in theſe, but cannot faile in thoſe. But you
in oppoſition to all others maintayne, That the Church may erre both in
Fundamentall and not Fundamentall Articles; from whence, every one would
inferr, that ſhe is abſolutly fallible in both, and infallible in neither;
or if infallible in either, in both: And yet you haue found a deviſe, that
though ſhe erre in both thoſe kinds of Articles, ſhe is infallible in one
of them only, that is, in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Points: And fallible in Points not
Fundamentall. A rare piece of Philoſophy! To erre damnably, and
Fundamentally, and yet be infallible! Yea, which is moſt admirable, to be
infallible, becauſe ſhe erres moſt deeply, and be fallible becauſe
ſhe erres in matters of leſſer moment. Beſide, other Proteſtants put
a difference between the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall <pb n="412" facs="tcp:59214:215"/>Church is
infallible a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cannot erre in Fundamentall Points, but that Particular Churches
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Perſons may; But in your doctrine there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no ſuch diſtinction.
The vniverſall Church, with you, is infallible, becauſe if ſhe erre
Fundamentally, ſhe ceaſes to be a Church, as alſo Particular Churches, if
they erre Fundamentally, ceaſe to be Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and the ſame I ſay of
particular Perſons, and ſo particular Churches and Perſons ſhall be no
less infallible than the vniverſall Church, which is contrary to the doctrine
of other Proteſtants, and to your owne words alſo (Pag: 106. N. 140.)
<hi>We yield vnto you, that there ſhall be a Church which never erreth in
ſome Points, becauſe (as we conceaue) God hath promiſed ſo much.</hi>
Now you will not ſay, that <hi>God hath promiſed ſo much</hi> to
particular Churches and Perſons; and therfor you muſt put a difference
between the vniverſall, and particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; which difference cannot
ſtand with this your ſpeculation, that the Church is only in fallible in
ſome points, becauſe if ſhe erre in them, ſhe ceaſes to be a Church:
which exoticall kind of infallibility agrees to all particular Churches, and
perſons.</p>
               <p n="87">87. Hence it is, that Proteſtants ground the Perpetuily
of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfall Church, not vpon a probable belief or hope that it ſhall
be ſo, or vpon Her actuall not erring Fundamentally, as you do, but vpon
ſome antecedent Principle, namely, the Promiſes of our Saviour Chriſt and
Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt. Dr. Potter in particular, whom you
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke to defend, ſpeakes very clearly to this purpoſe (Pag: 105.) in
theſe words, <hi>The whole Militant Church, (that is all the members of it)
cannot posſibly erre, either in the whole Faith, or any neceſſary Article
of it. For, ſuch an errour muſt needs diſvnite all the Members from
Chriſt the Head; and ſo diſſolue the Body, and leaue Him no Church,
which is imposſible.</hi> Mark that he ſayth not as you doe; The Church
cannot erre in any neceſſary Article, becauſe therby ſhe ſhould
ceaſe to be a Church, but contrarily, ſeing it is impoſſible that ſhe
can ceaſe to be a Church, and leaue Chriſt no Church, ſhe cannot
<hi>posſibly erre in the whole Faith, or any neceſſary Article of
it.</hi> With what modeſty, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience do you alledg here Dr. Potter,
as if he did not diſagree from you? The contrary wherof will appeare more by
his words (Pag: 153.154.155.) The Church, ſaith he, <hi>Vniverſall is ever
in ſuch manner aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the good ſpirit, that it never totally
failes, or falls of from Chriſt. For it is ſo firmely founded on the
Rocke:</hi> Matth: 16.18. (<hi>that is on Chriſt the only Fundation,</hi>
Cor: 3.11.) <hi>that the gates of Hell) whether by <pb n="413" facs="tcp:59214:215"/>temptation, or perſecution) ſhall not prevaile againſt it.</hi>
And that you may ſee how far he was from dreaming of your Chimericall
infallibility, he cites Bellarmine (de Eccleſ: Lib: 3. Cap: 13. ſaying,
That the Church cannot erre, is proved out of Scripture, (Matth: 16.) vpon
<hi>this rocke I will build my Church</hi>) and then goes on in theſe words:
<hi>The whole Church cannot ſo erre as to be deſtroyed. For then our Lords
promiſe here</hi> (Matth: 16.18.) <hi>of Her ſtable edification, ſhould
be of no value.</hi> Obſerue this: And what he hath afterward, in theſe
words: <hi>The Church vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall hath not the like aſſurance from
Chriſt, that ſhe ſhall not erre in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary additions, as ſhe
hath for her not erring in taking away from the Faith, what is Fundamentall and
neceſſary. It is comfort enough for the Church, that the Lord in mercy will
ſecure her from all capitall dangers, and conſerue her on earth againſt
all enemyes: But ſhe may not hope to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over all ſinne and error.
That the Church be never robbed of any truth neceſſary to the being of the
Church, the promiſes of Chriſt aſſure vs.</hi> Behold; Firſt; The
Church may erre in not Fundamentall, but cannot erre in Fundamentall Ponts,
wheras you ſay ſhe may erre in both. 2. That the reaſon why ſhe canot
erre in Fundamentall Points, is, becauſe ſhe is firmely founded on the
rocke, and if ſhe did faile, our Lords promiſe of her ſtableedification
ſhould be of no value: And therfore the Lord will even ſecure her from all
capitall dangers, and of this, the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Chriſt aſſure vs. And
this, as I ſayd, is the common doctrine of Proteſtants: Wherby it appeares,
that the Church is not ſayd to be infallible in Fundamentall Points,
becauſe ſhe ſhould periſh by every ſuch Error; but contrarily,
becauſe ſhe is aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt, never to erre in ſuch
Points, ſhe ſhall never be deſtroyed; in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to you who
ſay, that ſhe may erre, and by erring be deſtroyed. What a kind of
Syllogiſme muſt be framed out of this your Doctrine, in this manner? The
Church is infallible, or cannot erre in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Points, becauſe if
ſhe did ſo erre, ſhe ſhould ceaſe to be a Church: But ſhe may
ceaſe to be a Church: Therfore ſhe is infallible, and cannot erre in
Fundamentalls. You ſhould in ferr the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: Therfore ſhe may
erre, and is not infallible. I beſeech you, of what value ſhould our
Saviours promiſes be, according to your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine? That the Church ſhould
not erre, at leaſt in Fundamentall Poynts of Faith? No. You ſay ſhe can
erre in ſuch Points. In what then? Only in this admirable worke, that if
ſhe did erre, ſhe ſhould be ſure to pay for it, by periſhing. For,
ſay you, <hi>To ſay the Church, while <pb n="414" facs="tcp:59214:216"/>it is the
Church, may erre in Fundamentalls, implyes contradiction, and is all one as to
ſay, the Church, while it is the Church, may not be the Church.</hi> This
then is the effect of Gods Promiſes, that that ſhall be, which implyes
contradiction to be otherwiſe; that is, Gods Power and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhall
only effect, that two contradictions be not true; as, that if ſome Living
ſenſible creature be a beaſt, he ſhall not be a man. Is not this to be
ſacrilegiouſly impious againſt God, and his holy Promiſes, and
Providence? Is the Church ſo built vpon a Rocke, aſſiſted by the Holy
Ghoſt, that the gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt Her, only to
this effect, that if ſhe erre, ſhe ſhall periſh; that is, the Gates of
Hell ſhall in the moſt prevalent way that can be imagined, prevaile
againſt her? What fooliſh impietyes are theſe? Let vs therfore inferr out
of theſe Premiſes: That there muſt be alwayes a true viſible Church,
knowen, and diſcernable from all falſe ones, and therfore of one
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination: That even according to Proteſtants, this true Church muſt be
infallible in all Fundamentall Points: That if ſhe be infallible in
Fundamentall Points, we muſt belieue Her to be infallible in all, even
according to your owne grant, as I haue ſhewed out of your owne words: And
ſo finally we muſt conclude, that there muſt be alwayes a viſible
Church of one denomination, and infallible in all Points of Faith, as well
Fundamentall, as not Fundamentall.</p>
               <p n="88">88. And by what hath bene ſayd, I confute and retort
your ſaying, (Pag: 150. N. 39.) <hi>A man that were deſtitute of all meanes
of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his thoughts to others, might yet in himſelfe and to
himſelf be infallible, but he could not be a Guide to others. A man, or a
church that were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſo that none could know how to repayre to it
for direction, could not be an infallible Guide, and yet he might be himſelf
infallible.</hi> This, I ſay, is retorted. For whoſoever is infallible in
him ſelfe, is fit to be an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Guide to others, per ſe loquendo,
and in actu primo, and needs only that accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall impediments bee removed, as
it happeneth in our caſe, the Church being viſible, and ſpred over the
whole world. So that ſhe can be hidden to no body, but is furniſhed with
all meanes of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating her Doctrine to others. Yourſelf, and
Proteſtants, grant, that the Church is a neceſſary introduction to Faith,
which ſhe could not be, if ſhe were inviſible, or that none could know
how to repayre to her for direction: And then Proteſtants teaching that ſhe
is infallible in Fundamentall points, it followes, that ſhe may be an
infallible Guide in ſuch points, and in all other, according to your owne 
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:59214:216"/>inference. And ſo I conclude that your difference of
the Churches being infallible, and an infallible Guide, is vaniſhed into
nothing. But enough of this. Let vs now proceed to other Reaſons proving the
neceſſity of an infallible Guide.</p>
               <p n="89">89. I proue the infallibility of the Church, by confuting
a Reaſon or ſimilitude much vrged by our Adverſaryes: That to him who
knowes the way, a Guide is not neceſſary: And therfore the Scripture being
a plaine Rule for all neceſſary Articles of Faith, no living Guide will be
neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="90">90. But this Argument is many wayes defectiue. 1. We
retort it; Seing it hath bene proved that Scripture alone is not a ſufficient
Rule, a Living Guide muſt be neceſſary. Certainly if the whole Bible had
bene put into ſeverall mens hands, without any precedent knowne Tradition,
Declaration, or Miniſtery of the Church, it would haue fallen out, that in
the moſt important Myſteryes of Chriſtian Religion, which now all are
obliged to belieue, for example, The chiefeſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Creed,
Sacraments &amp;c. ſcarcely any one would haue agreed with another; and much
more had it bene impoſſible for them by the ſole evidence of Scripture,
to joyne in the ſame Idea, or frame of a Church. Suppoſe then the Bible had
bene offered to ſome Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Pagan, wholy ignorant of Chriſtian
Religion and Doctrine, do you thinke he would haue bene able to gather from the
bare words of Scripture, the ſame meaning, or Articles, which Chriſtians
now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue by the help of Tradition, inſtruction, and preaching? I ſay,
he would never have fallen vpon the ſame meaning of the words, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he
did belieue them to be true, or no, (as we ſee Proteſtants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
cannot agree.) Which is a ſigne, that the words only of Scripture do not
evidently ſignify thoſe Myſteryes, which Chriſtians belieue them to
containe: Otherwiſe every one who vnderſtands the words, would vnderſtand
the true ſenſe, as ordinarily we vnderſtand the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of other
writings, wherin we ſee men do ſeldome diſagree. And the more we
conſider the force, vſe, and neceſſity of Tradition, the more we
ſhall be conſtrained to ranke it among thoſe things, which are better
knowen, by wanting, than we can apprehend by alwayes enjoying them. If men did
do things only by the Booke, even in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall arts, or handy-crafts, how
different and vnlike works would every one take from the precepts, learned only
by reading, and with how much ſtudy and difficulty would that be done, and
how different <pb n="416" facs="tcp:59214:217"/>would they be both from one another, and
from thoſe, which artificers do now by cuſtome and tradition worke with
great eaſe and vniformity? I doubt whether you would truſt an apothecary
taught only by his booke, or pharmacopaeia, without any maſter at all.</p>
               <p n="91">91. Secondly; If one know a way as perfectly as it is
capable to be knowen, but that indeed it is ſuch, as there cannot
poſſibly be given any Rule or Direction how to find, or walk in it without
danger of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſuch a knowledg of ſuch a way would not be ſufficient
of itſelf, but a guide would be neceſſary to ſind, and walke in it,
without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Now we haue ſhewed, not only that the Scripture containes
not all points neceſſary to be believed, (for which therfor we ſtand in
need of a guide) but alſo that there is no certaine infallible Rule, how to
know certainly the meaning of thoſe truths which it containes, which we
proved out of Proteſtants themſelves, and by the many hard and intricate
Rules which they give for that purpoſe, and by their perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and
irreconciliable differences, which could not happen, if they had any ſuch
cleare and certaine Rules, wherin agreeing, they muſt needs agree among
themſelves. Que ſunt eadem vni tertio ſunt eadem inter ſe. Therfore
beſide ſcripture which you compare to a way, there muſt be a living Judg
to guide vs in that way.</p>
               <p n="92">92. Thirdly: You teach, That Scripture is a plaine way,
in this ſenſe, that although we cannot either by it, or any other Meanes,
know what points in particulat be Fundamentall; yet becauſe all ſuch
Truths, and many more, are evident in Scripture, whoſoever knowes all that is
evident, ſhall beſure to know all that is neceſſary or Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.
Now this very Doctrine ſhewes, that Scripture alone cannot be a plaine and
ſufficient way. For, to know preciſely and certainly all evident places of
Scripture, is impoſſible to many, and of obligation to none, as I declared
elſwhere; and therfore the End (which is to know all neceſſary points,
and can be attayned by this Meanes alone) cannot be of obligation, which to
affirme is abſurd; as if one ſhould ſay, points neceſſary to be
knowen, are not neceſſary to be knowen. By a Living Guide this difficulty
is avoyded, we being ſure that the Church will not faile to propoſe in due
tyme, all that ſhall be neceſſary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impoſing on mens
Conſciences, heavy, and vngrounded bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
               <p n="93">93. Fourthly; There is a great and plaine diſparity
betweene the knowing of a way by our corporall eyes, and finding out a Truth by
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:59214:217"/>our vnderſtanding, the eye of our ſoule. Our
ſenſes are naturally, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, and immoveably determined to their
objects. One who is ſuppoſed to know his way perfectly, may Voluntarily
take an other way, but cannot therfore be ſayd to miſtake his owne. It
paſſes not ſo with our vnderſtanding, except in ſome prime principles
of Reaſon, evident of themſelves. In other points, which either are
elevated above the naturall forces of humane capacity, or haue an appearance of
being contrary to it, or croſſe our will, or cary with them a repugnance to
the naturall dictates and inclinations of fleſh and bloud, our
vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is apt and ready to miſtake or be miſled, as daily
experience teaches, and therfore ſtands in need of ſome aſſiſting
help and Authority, believed to be infallible, to ſtrengthen and ſettle it
againſt all encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and temptations. It is your owne Aſſertion (Pag:
329. N. 7.) that, <hi>the Points which we belieue, ſhould not be ſo
evidently certaine, as to neceſſitate our vnderſtanding to an Aſſent,
that ſo there might be ſome Obedience in Faith, which can hardly haue place
where there is no poſſibility of diſobedience as there is not, when the
vnderſtanding does all, and the will nothing. Now the Religion of
protestants, though it be much more credible than yours, yet is not pretended
to haue the abſolute evidence of ſenſe or demonſtration.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a
confeſſed difference, between one who knowes a way by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of
ſenſe, and an other, who believes a way or Rule only by Faith. The former
needs no command of the will, nor any guide; but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter needs a guide, and
you confess he needs the command of the will, which were not needfull if the
way, which is Holy Scripture, were ſo plaine as you pretend: and if the
vnderſtanding muſt depend on the will for believing Points which ſeeme
evident in Scripture, that there might be ſome place for obedience; how
ſhall the weakness and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of the will it ſelf be eſtabliſhed,
except by ſome other infallible Living Authority? And therfore your Argument
proves nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it proves too much; that, as one who knowes and
ſees his way, neeeds no helpe of his will, or of Guide, or any other
particular aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; ſo for attaining the true meaning of Scripture,
we need no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, no diligence, even ſuch as Proteſtants
preſcribe, as skill in languages, conferring of places &amp;c: though (2 Pet:
1.21) it be ſaied; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Not by mans will was prophecie brought
at any time: But the holy men of God ſpake, inſpired with the Holy
Ghoſt.</q> Which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queles being very falſe, you muſt acknowledg a
great diſparity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the evident knowing of a way, and vnderſtanding
Scripture. To <pb n="418" facs="tcp:59214:218"/>which purpoſe. I may well alledg your
owne words (Pag: 137. N. 19.) <hi>If we conſider the ſtrang power that
education and prejudices inſtilled by it, haue over, even excellent
vnderſtandings, we may well imagine that many Truths which in themſelves
are revealed plainly enough, are yet to ſuch or ſuch a man,
prepoſſeſt with contrary opinions, not revealed plainly.</hi> I pray you
tell vs, what education, or prejudices, could hinder a man from finding that
way, which he is ſuppoſed perfectly to know, and which it is not in his
power to miſſe by ignorance, though, as I fayd, he may voluntary goe out of
it? You muſt therfore acknowledg, that your ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude or parity is
nothing but a diſparate, and diſparity.</p>
               <p n="94">94. Fiftly: Let a man be never ſo perfect in the
knowledg of his way, he ſhall never come to his journeyes end, if he want
ſtrength to walke that way. Now Faith being the gift of God, and requiring
the aſſiſtance of Grace, exceeds the ſtrength of humane wit or will;
and this Grace being not given but by the Miniſtery of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I
haue declared, and as we haue heard Calvin ſaying <hi>God inſpires Faith,
but by the inſtrument of the Goſpell as Paul</hi> teacheth, that <hi>Faith
comes by hearing:</hi> It followes, that none can, in the ordinary courſe,
receiue ſtrength to vnderſtand, and know the way, which you ſay is
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without the Miniſtery of the Church, or a Living Guide; and ſo
it appeares many wayes, that your Argument, or ſimilitude proves nothing
againſt vs, but very much againſt yourſelf.</p>
               <p n="95">95. Tenthly, and laſtly: I proue the vniverſall
infallibility of the Church, by anſwering an Argument or removing an
impediment, which Potter objects, as if ſome Catholique Doctours held not the
Church to be vniverſally infallible. This the Doctour (Pag: 149.) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to proue out of Dr. Stapleton in particular; as if he did deny the Church to be
infallible in Poynts not Fundamentall; to which purpoſe he cites him
(Princip: Doctrinal: Lib: 8. Contr: 4. Cap: 15.) But this is clearly confuted
by <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 2. Chap: 5. Pag: 127.128.129.130.)
ſhewing, that Dr. Stapleton doth not oppoſe Poynts Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall to other
revealed Truths, or Points of Faith not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, as if the infallibility
of the Church did extend itſelf only to Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Articles; but he
diſtinguiſhes between Points revealed, and belonging to Faith, and Points
not revealed, nor belonging to Faith, but to Philoſophy, or curious
diſputes, either not called in Queſtion amongſt Catholikes, as if they
were matters belonging to Religion, or if they chance to be ſuch, yet are not
defined by the Church. For, if <pb n="419" facs="tcp:59214:218"/>once they be controverted,
and the Church giue her ſentence, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly teaches in the ſame
place, that the infallibility of the Church hath place in thoſe Points which
are <hi>called in Queſtion,</hi> or are publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely <hi>practiſed by the
Church:</hi> As alſo (Rel: Cont: 1. Q. 3. Art: 6.) He expreſſly ſaith,
that <hi>certaine Doctrines are either primary Principles of Faith, or els,
though not primary, yet defined by the Church, and ſo, as if they were
primary. Others are Concluſions deduced from thoſe Principles, but yet not
deſined. Of the firſt kind are the Articles of Faith, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is
defined in Councels againſt Heretiques &amp;c: Of the ſecond, are
queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which either belong to the hidden workes of God, or to certaine
moſt obſcure places of Scripture, which are beſide the Faith, and of
which we may be ignorant without loſſe of Faith, yet they may be
modeſtly, and fruitfully diſputed of.</hi> And afterward he teaches, that
<hi>whatſoever the Church doth vniverſally hold, either in doctrnie or
manners, belongs to the foundation of Faith:</hi> And proves it out of S.
Auſtine, (Serm: 14. de verb: Domini. Ep: 28.89.96.) who calls the cuſtome
of the Church, <hi>Eccleſiae morem fundatiſſimum, &amp; Fidem
fundatiſſimam, conſuetudinem Eccleſiae fundatiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam, Authoritatem
ſtabiliſſimam fundatiſſimae Eccleſiae: The moſt grounded
practiſe of the Church, and moſt grounded Faith, the moſt grounded
cuſtome of the Church, the moſt firme Authority of the moſt grounded
Church.</hi> Could any thing be more cleere, to ſhew, that according to Dr.
Stapleton, the infallibility of the Church reacheth further then to thoſe
Points which you call Fundamentall, and that it belongs to the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Faith, that we belieue whatſoever the Church holds? And that it is not
lawfull for any to diſpute againſt ſuch determinations of the Church?
Which doth overthrow your diſtinction of Poynts Fundmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and not
Fundamentall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though you alledg the Authority of S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas (2.2. Q. 2.
Art: 5.) and Stapleton in favour therof. For S. Thomas in the very place you
cited, after he had ſayd, that there are ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Faith which we
are bound explicitely to belieue; addeth, that we are bound to belieue all
other Poynts, when they are ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to vs, as belonging to
Faith. Thus far <hi>Charity Maintayn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d.</hi> Wherby it is manifeſt, that according to Stapleton, the
Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in defining any point to be revealed, which is not ſo; or
that it is not revealed, if indeed it be ſo; and conſequently, that ſhe
is vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally infallible in all points belonging to Faith, whether they be
of them ſelves Fundamentall, or not Fundamentall. I ſay, of themſelves:
for in ſenſu compoſito, as I may ſay, That is, vpon ſuppoſition
that once <pb n="420" facs="tcp:59214:219"/>they be deſined, he expreſſly declares;
as we haue ſeene, that <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Fundation of Faith
whatſoever the Church vniverſally holds either in Doctrine or
worſhip.</hi> When therfore he ſayth: (Princip: Doctrin: Controv: 4. Lib:
8. Chap: 15.) <hi>for God, as alſo nature, as he is not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in things
neceſſary, ſo is he not laviſh in ſuperflnityes;</hi> He ſpeakes
not of points of Faith not Fundamentall, which being once defined, he
profeſſes to belong to the Fundation of Faith, but in the next prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
words he expreſſly declares, that when he ſaith, the Church is not
infallible, he vnderſtands only, that infallibility was not granted to her
<hi>Propter aut invtiles curioſitates explendas, aut ſubtilitates non
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarias inveſtigandas; Either for ſatiſfying idle curioſityes,
or finding out vnneceſſary ſubtiltyes;</hi> and proves it, becauſe
<hi>God and nature as they are not wanting in things neceſſary, ſo are
they not laviſh in ſuperfluityes.</hi> And therfore Potter did wrong the
learned Stapleton, alledging thoſe his words, as if he had ever dreamed, that
the Church is not vniverſally infallible in all Points of Faith, whether the
matters, of themſelves, be great or ſmall.</p>
               <p n="96">96. And you alſo wrong <hi>Charity
Maintayned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in ſaying (Pag: 144. N. 32.) That he wrongs Dr. Potter
when (Part: 1. Pag: 91.) he writes thus: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Dr. Potter (Sect: 5. Pag: 150.)
ſpeakes very dangerouſly toward this purpoſe</q> (of limiting the
infallibility of the Apoſtles and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to neceſſary Points only, as
he reſtraines the Promiſes made by Chriſt to his Church) where he
endeavoureth to proue, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church
is limited to Points Fundamentall, becauſe as nature, ſo God is neither
defectiue in neceſſaryes, nor lavish in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluityes. Which Reaſon
doth likewiſe proue, that the infallibility of Scripture, and of the
Apoſtles muſt be reſtrained to points neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, that
ſo God be not accuſed, as defective in neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, or laviſh in
ſuperfluityes.</q> In which words you ſay; <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi>
wrongs Dr. Potter: <hi>Becauſe it is not he, but Dr. Stapleton in him that
ſpeakes the words Charity Maintayned cavills at.</hi> Anſwer; If
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> had abſolutely aſſirmed, thoſe to be the
very words of Dr. Potter, the Doctour might blame himſelf only; who having
firſt cited the immediatly precedent words of Dr. Stapleton in a different or
cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue letter, declaring that they were Dr. Stapletons, and not his owne:
the words immediatly following (for as nature, ſo God is neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue
&amp;c.) he ſets downe in the ordinary letter of his Booke both in his
firſt and ſecond Edition. 2. Seing Potter accepts, and approves 
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:59214:219"/>thoſe words, he muſt be anſwerable, for all
conſequences that are truly deduced from them, as if they were his owne. 3.
The truth is Dr. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton brings thoſe words for a purpoſe not only
different, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that for which Dr. Potter alledges them, and
therfore not Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton, but Potter muſt be lyable to all bad conſequences,
which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low out of them. For, Potter would proue out of them, that
infallibility was given to the Church, not for all, but only for Fundamentall
points of Faith; which we haue ſeene to be directly contrary to the Doctrine
of Stapleton, who out of the ſayd words proves only, that infallibility was
not granted, for deciding idle curioſityes, or vnprofitable ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes:
And therfor, 4. ſeing the life and eſſence of words, is their
ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, this being wholy different in thoſe words, as they are
ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Stapleton, and vnderſtood, miſapplyed, and miſalledged by
Potter, <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> did not wrong him, but he did wrong Dr.
Stapleton in applying the ſound, and as I may ſay, carcaſſe of his
words, againſt the true meaning and life of them, intended, and fully
declared by Stapleton; as you alſo, do wrong Stapleton in approving Potters
allegation of thoſe words; and <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> as if he had
wronged Potter. Who can deny this to be a good conſequence; God is neither
defectiue in neceſſaryes, nor laviſh in ſuperfluityes; Therfor he hath
not induced the Church with infallibility for deciding of vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
queſtions; which is Stapletons Argument? As contrarily this other is of no
force; God is not laviſh in ſuperfluityes; Therfore he hath not conferred
infallibility vpon his Church, for any other Points of Faith, and revealed
Truths, except ſuch as are of themſelves neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as
if all points which are not Fundamentall were curious or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
matters.) Which Potter doth inferr, directly againſt the conſequence which
Stapleton drawes from thoſe very ſame words, affirming, that every thing
defined by the Church, belongs to the Foundation of Faith. Beſides, ſince
Potter alledgeth thoſe words, to proue that the promiſes of our Saviour
made to his Church, muſt be reſtrained to Points Fundamentall, leaſt he
might ſeeme laviſh in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluityes; <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> had
reaſon to inferr, that for the ſame Reaſon of not being laviſh in
ſuperfluityes, the Doctour might limite the infallibility of the Apoſtles
to neceſſary and Fundamentall Points. Neither is it ſufficient for you to
ſay (Pag: 143. N. 30.) that we read in Scripture, <hi>All Scripture is
divinely inſpired,</hi> and therfore All Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether it deliver
Fundamentall, or not Fundamentall Points is <pb n="422" facs="tcp:59214:220"/>true. For,
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in this very place and about this very Text of
Scripture which you cite out of him (and endeavour to anſwer) by way of
prevention, had confuted this your inſtance, in theſe words: If it be
vrged, 
<q rend="margQuotes">That All Scripture is divinely
inſpired, that it is the word of God &amp;c: Dr. Potter hath affoarded you a
ready anſwer, to ſay, That Scripture is inſpired, &amp;c:</q> Only in
thoſe parts or parcells wherin it delivereth Fundamentall points: Thus
<hi>Charity Maintayned.</hi> But you thought ſafeſt to diſſemble,
theſe words. And I pray, if thoſe vnlimited words concerning the Church;
that the <hi>gates of hell ſhall not privaile againſt her</hi> (Matth:
16.18.) and that the holy Ghoſt ſhall lead her into all truth &amp;c:
(which texts are alledged by Potter) muſt be limited to Fundamentall points;
why may not thoſe other words, <hi>all ſcripture is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inſpired,</hi> ſignify only, that all ſcripture is inſpired, for what
belongs to points fundamentall, or neceſſary to ſalvation, as <hi>Cha:
Ma:</hi> doth vrge in the ſame place.</p>
               <p n="97">97. Now then, vpon the whole matter it is manifeſt;
that the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Dr. Stapleton, teaches neither more nor leſſe, concerning
the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church, than all other Catholikes doe. For,
(beſides that which we haue ſayd already) Relect: Controv: 4. Queſt: 2.
He expreſſly declares, That ſhe is infallible in the Concluſion or
Doctrine and definition, though it be not neceſſary, that she be Infallible
in the Arguments, or proofes, or manner of teaching. Eſt, ſaith he, in
ipſa Doctrina infalliblis, etſi in forma &amp; ratione docendi, non ita:
and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he puts no difference, between the certainty of her Definitions,
though the Reaſons or proofes which ſhe vſe, chance to haue, of
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, more or less certainty, whether they be taken from Scripture, or
Tradition, or otherwiſe; in regard that theſe may chance not to be ſo
cleare, as of themſelves alone to convince. 2. He teaches, That the objects
of Her certainty are not Queſtions vnneceſſary, but ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to
the ſubſtance of Faith, publike Doctrine, and things neceſſary to
ſalvation: and we haue heard him ſay, ad fundamentum Fidei per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinere
quidquid Eccleſia tenet, ſive in Doctrina, ſive in cultu: That
whatſoever the Church holds, either in Doctrine, or in worſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to
the fundation of Faith, and that all things defined by the Church, are as if
they were primary principles of Faith, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him, all things

               <p n="98">98. But here is not an end of Potters taxing Dr.
Stapleton without <pb n="423" facs="tcp:59214:220"/>ground, and againſt truth. For (Pag:
161.) he ſaith; <hi>Stapleton hath a new pretty deviſe, that the Church,
though ſhe be fallible and diſcurſiue in the Meanes, is yet Propheticall,
and depends vpon immediate Revelation (and ſo infallible) in delivering the
Concluſion.</hi> And (Pag: 169.) he ſaith: <hi>Bellarmin leaves his
companion Stapleton to walke alone in this dangerous path and avoweh to the
contrary</hi> (De Concil: Lib: 1 Chap: § Dicuntur igitur.) <hi>that
Councells neither haue, nor write immediate Revelations:</hi> But Mr. Doctour,
to ſpeake truth, Bellarmin leaves Stapleton, juſt as you leaue your art of
citing Authors againſt their meaning. Bellarmin tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, That Councells
neither haue, nor write immediate Revelations. And does not Stapleton
purpoſely teach, and carefully proue the ſame? And does he not doe it, even
in the firſt and Third Notabili, which immediatly precede that fourth
Notabile, out of which you pretend to draw that, which you call a new pretty
deviſe? How then can you ſay, that Stapleton teaches, that the Church is
<hi>Propheticall, and depends vpon immediate Reuelation in delivering the
Concluſion;</hi> ſeing he teaches expreſſly the contrary? Nay, doth he
not in that very fourth Notabili which you cite, expreſſly ſay;
Eccleſiae Doctrina non eſt ſimpliciter Prophetica, aut ex Revelationibus
immediatis dependens. <hi>The doctrine of the Church, is not ſimply
Propheticall, or depending vpon immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> Who would haue
believed, that in matters of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, you could vſe ſo
litle ſincerity? Dr. Stapleton teaches the ſame, and proves very learnedly
(Princip: Doctrin: Contr: 4. Lib: 8. C. 15.) Which very Chapter you alſo
cite, and yet make no conſcience to tell vs, that Bellarmin in this leaues
Stapleton. But how then doth Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſay, <hi>the Doctrine of the Church
is diſcurſiue in the Meanes, but is Propheticall and divine in the
Concluſion?</hi> Anſwer. We haue ſhewed, that Stapleton ſayes
expreſſly in the ſame place, That the Doctrine of the Church is not
Propheticall: And beſides, he explicates the word Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetica by the word
Divina, which you leaue out, and ſayth it is divina propter ea quae in tertio
&amp; quarto Argumentis produximus: <hi>for the cauſes which we alledged in
the Third and Fourth Arguments:</hi> In which Arguments he proved, that the
Church is infallible, and cannot erre, becauſe ſhe is guided and taught by
an infallible maiſter the Holy Ghoſt, as the Prophets were, (and in this
agrees with Prophets) though as I ſayd out of Stapletons express words, with
this difference, that the Prophets had immediate Revelations, which the Church
pretends not to haue, but is infallibly directed by the Holy Ghoſt, to
imbrace <pb n="424" facs="tcp:59214:221"/>and declare former revelations, made to the
Apoſtles; vppon which aſſiſtance the certainty and infallibility of her
definitions rely, and not vpon diſcourſes or inducements.</p>
               <p n="99">99. Potters falſification will appeare more by theſe
words of Stapleton <hi>The Doctrine of the Church is diſcurſiue in the
meanes, but is propheticall and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in the Concluſion:</hi> which Potter
cites thus <hi>the the Church though ſhe be fallible and diſcurſiue in
the Meanes, is yet Propheticall, and depends vpon immediate Revelation, (and
ſo infallible) in delivering the concluſion.</hi> What a mixture is here of
Potters words with the words of Stapleton? Which ſay not that the Church,
depends vpon immediate Revelation, but the direct contrary as we haue ſayd,
and his Parentheſis, (and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible) is alſo a falſificarion, as
if Stapleton had grounded the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the concluſion vpon immediate
revelation, wheras he groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des it vpon an other principle, as we haue ſeene.
This being ſuppoſed, that Stapleton teaches, the Church to haue no
immediate Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the certainty of her Definitions to depend on the
aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, not vpon humane diſce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſe, and inducements, or
Premiſes, the Doctour had no Reaſon to ſay that Stapletons doctrine is a
fanſie <hi>repugnant to Reaſon and to itſelf.</hi> He Objects (pag: 168.)
<hi>A conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion followes the diſpoſition of the Meanes, and reſults
from them.</hi> But this is not to the purpoſe; ſeing the Definitions of
the Church are called by Stapleton, Concluſions, only becauſe they are that
which the Church determines and concludes, not becauſe they are formall
Concluſions, eſſentially, as ſuch, depending on Premiſes. Neither
doth it follow, that there can be no vſe of diligence and diſcourſe, if
the Church be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, in the ſenſe I haue declared. Thus the
Apoſtles in their Councell (Act. 15.) did vſe diligence, and, as the
Scripture ſaith, there was made a great diſputation, and they alledged the
working of Miracles a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d other Arguments of Credibility, and yet no Chriſtian
will deny, but that the Apoſtles were infallible: So the Church muſt on her
behalfe vſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and diſcourſe, that all things on her parte, may
be done more ſweetly, in order to the perſwading of others; but the
abſolute certainty of her definitions and concluſions, muſt rely vpon
thoſe words which the Apoſtles vſed, Viſum eſt Spiritui Sancto &amp;
nobis: It hath ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and vs. Neither likwiſe
doth it follow, that the Canons of Councells are of equall authority with holy.
Scriptures, in which every reaſon, diſcourſe, Text, and word, are
infallible; which <pb n="425" facs="tcp:59214:221"/>we need not ſay of Councells, though
they be certaine and infallible for the ſubſtance of their definition;
Wherof more may be ſeene in Catholique Writers, and particularly in
Bellarmine whom even Potter doth cite, (de Concill: Lib: 2. Chap: 12.) and yet,
as if he had ſeene no ſuch matter in Bellarmine, inferrs againſt
Stapleton (who fully agrees with Bellarmine) that if the canons of Councells be
divinely inſpired, they muſt be of equall Authority with the Holy
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</p>
               <p n="100">100. Many other Arguments might be brought, to proue the
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of an infallible Living Guide, and Eccleſiaſticall
Traditions; from Scriptures, Fathers, Theologicall Reaſons, which I omitt,
referring the Reader to <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part. 1. Chap: 2. and 3.)

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Say, in what manner and order. For we having
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved the Infallibility of the Church; inre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines only now to
declare, how we can do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling, into a Circle, proving the
Scripture, by the Church, and the Church by the Scripture, which you object
without end; though, if you be a man of any ſolid learning, it is
impoſſible you could be ignorant of the Anſwer, which Catholike Writers
giue to this common objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We grant that with different ſorts of
perſons, we muſt proceed in a different way. If one belieue not the Church,
or Notes, proprietyes, and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives belonging to Her, and yet belieue
Scripture to be the Word of <pb n="427" facs="tcp:59214:222"/>God; to ſuch a man the
Church may be proved by Scripture; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, to him who believes the
Infallibility of the Church, it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in vertue of Her
Authority, what Scripture is Canonicall, and what is the true ſenſe therof,
by informing him what Canon the Church receyves, and what Interpretation ſhe
gives. Thus, in regard Proteſtants deny the Infallibility of the Church, but
pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue Scripture to be the Word of God, to them we proue by
Scripture the perpetuall Exiſtence, Vnity, Authority, Sanctity, Propagation,
efficacy, Infallibility, and other Propertyes of the Church. But ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
per ſe, and ex natura rei, the Church is proved independently of Scripture,
which we receyue from the Church, as you grant, which was in Being before the
Scripture, as all muſt yield; and yet at that tyme there wanted not meanes to
find the Church. For, none could haue believed the Scripture to be Infallible,
vnless firſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Writers to be infallible; and many were
converted to the true Church, before they could belieue the Scripture, as not
extant at that tyme. So that all muſt grant, that there be Meanes, and
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, wherby ſome men may gaine ſuch credit, as others may, and ought
vnder payne of damnation, to belieue, that they are Perſons to be accepted as
Meſſengers of God, and Teachers of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus Moyſes, the Prophets, our Saviour Chriſt, the
Apoſtles, all Apoſtolicall men by whom God hath converted Nations to the
true Faith and knowledg of Him, did proue themſelves true Preachers, by many
effectuall, and moſt certaine inducements, independently of the Old, or New
Teſtament; yea S. Irenaeus relates, as you expreſſly grant, that ſome
Nations were made Chriſtians without any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Scripture. As
therfore our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſties, and all they who
afterward converted the world to Chriſtian Religion, proved themſelves to
be ſent by God; (being verifyed of them, <hi>He that heareth you heareth me,
and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth me,
deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi>) by Miracles, Sanctity of life, Efficacy
of Doctrine, admirable repentance of ſinners, Chang of manners, Converſion
of all ſorts of Perſons, of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, through the whole world; and
this to a Faith, Profeſſion, and Religion, that propoſes many Points, as
neceſſary to be believed, aboue, and ſeemingly contrary, to humane
Reaſon, and againſt mens naturall inclinations; togeather with the
conſideration of the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <pb n="428" facs="tcp:59214:223"/>of Martyrs,
Abnegation of Confeſſours, Purity of Uirgins, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude even of the
youngeſt Age, and weaker ſexe, and other admirable conſpicuous Notes, and
ſtrong inforcements, to gaine an abſolute and vndoubted aſſent to
whatſoever they ſhould propoſe in Matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Faith and Religion:
So the Church of God by the like ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Arguments and Notes, of
many great and manifeſt Miracles; Sanctity; Sufferings: Uictory over all
ſorts of enemyes, Converſion of Infidels, all which Notes are dayly more
and more conſpicuous and convincing, and ſhall be encreaſing the longer
the world ſhall laſt; and it ſeemes, God in his wiſdome and Goodness
hath bleſſed vs very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſince the appearing of Luther, and
other moderne Heretikes, for the greater confuſion of them, and glory of his
Church; and the ſame I ſay of the name Catholique, which is continually
more verifyed by acceſſion of new Countreyes; as alſo that of
ſucceſſion of Biſhops from the Apoſtles, particularly in the Sea of
Rome; Vnity, Stability, Perpetuity: The Church, I ſay, by theſe and the
like evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, proves that ſhe deſerves credit, as the firſt
Doctours and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers did; and conſequently that her Doctrine, and
Definitions, in Matters concerning Faith, are certainly true. And we may with
all truth avouch, that whoſoever either denyes theſe Notes of Miracles, and
the reſt to be found in the Catholique Roman Church, or deſpiſes them as
inſufficient, opens an inevitable way for Jewes, Turks, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, and all
enemyes of Chriſtian Religion, to deny the truth therof; which to them muſt
be proved by ſuch Arguments as are evidently found in the Roman Church, and
in no other Congregation. Moreover as the Apoſtles, and Apoſtolicall men,
were not believed to be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe they wrote Scripture but
contrarily, their Writings or Scriptures are believed to be infallibly true,
becauſe the Writers were preendued with Infallibility, which Infallibility
was proved by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and other Arguments: ſo the Church is believed
infallible in force of the ſame Arguments, abſtracting from any proofe
drawen from Scripture; wherby we are uery ſure not to run in a Circle, into
which we are not entered, while firſt we belieue the Church for ſuch
Arguments as I haue ſpoken of, and afterward embrace Scripture for the
Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Authority; and if we be forced to proue the Church by Scripture; it
is propter incredulitatem veſtram, for your incredulity, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
indeed it is needfull of itſelf. Whatſoever you object againſt vs in this
way, will be found, vpon examination, to impugne the infallibility 
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:59214:223"/>of the Apoſtles, and Primitiue Church, and to proue
that Inſidels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſtianity in vertue of ſuch Arguments, as
I haue touched, were rather deluded, than converted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any object, that although, what we haue ſayd, be
true of the true Church, yet it remaines to be proved that the Roman Church is
the true Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I anſwer; For our preſent purpoſe, it ſuffices
that the true Church be proved to be infallible, without deſcending to other
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſputes in this place: (Though ſomthing I haue touched
already.) This is cleare: That neither Proteſtants, nor any of our new
Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, can ſo much as pretend to the true Church, if they grant her to
be infallible, ſince they belieue their owne Church to be fallible. The
ſame I might ſay of the Gift of working Miracles; of which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſaith. (Marc: vlt: Verſ: 17.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Them that belieue, theſe ſignes
ſhall followe: They ſhall caſt out Divells. &amp;c:</q> On which place
Calvin (in Harmonia) confeſſes that the grace of Miracles is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
not to every one, but to the whole body of the Church. And in the marginall
notes of the Engliſh Bible printed An: 1576. vpon (Joan: 14. Verſ: 12.)
<hi>He that believes in me, the works that I doe, he ſhall doe, and
greater;</hi> our adverſaryes confess and ſay, that <hi>this is referred to
the whole body of the Church in whom this vertue doth ſhine for ever,</hi>
Luther alſo (To: 7. Lib: de Judaeis &amp;c:) vrgeth againſt the Jewes the
daily confirmation of our Chriſtian Faith by Miracles in all Ages ſince
Chriſt, ſaying; <hi>From God we haue learned and receaved, as an
everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting word and verity of God, for theſe thouſand fiue hundred
yeares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and confirmed by Miracles and ſignes.</hi> How then can
it be ſayd, that Miracles haue ceaſed ever ſince the Apoſtles tyme? Now
it is evident, that this Gift is laſting in our Church, and in our Church
only. The ſame appeares in the Motiue of Succeſſion of Biſhops;
Antiquity; U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; perpetuall Exiſtence; Converſion of Nations; which
Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes we manifeſtly proue to be wanting in all Sects. In England
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants did once pretend a Succeſſion of Biſhops; whoſe
inſtitution they pretended to hold as Divine: But this pretence is to little
purpoſe for them. For; 1. It was no vniverſall conſent, but oppoſed by
many, even in England; by Scotland, France, Holland, Germany, and other
Proteſtant Congregations. 2. They wanted both true Ordination, and
Succeſſion, and ſo could not be true Biſhops. 3. They held it not
neceſſary; but that they who reject them, may be ſaved; and it is
ſtrang, <pb n="430" facs="tcp:59214:224"/>that a Church rejecting and impugning a Divine
Inſtitution, can hope for ſalvation; yea even by this they either
acknowledg themſelves to haue had no abſolute certainty, that Epiſcopacy
is de Jure Divino; orels they ſpeake very inconſequently, and
vnchriſtianly, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, there may be true Churches, and
ſalvation. Who would not wonder to reade in Dr. Andrewes the pretended
Biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, and a prime man among Proteſtants in England,
theſe words, directed to the French Hugonot Molin (Reſponſ: ad Epiſt:
2. Petri Molinaei?) <hi>Quia hîc idem nobiſeum &amp;c: I make no doubt
but you are of the ſame opinion with vs in this matter. If without offence
you can profess ſo much, you ſhall doe a thing very gratfull to vs; if you
cannot, you ſhall performe a thing not vngratefull, if for tyme to come you
meddle not with our affaires. For, in the condition in which you are, it will
be hard both to pleaſe your owne, and not diſpleaſe ours: Neither doth it
follow, if ours be divini juris, of divine right, that either ſilvation
cannot be had, or the Church cannot ſtand without it.</hi> A ſtrang
Divinity, and fortitude, and zeale in a Biſhop; not to diſlike
diſſembling, in a thing believed to be Juris Divini, leaſt one offend his
pariſhioners; or that it is not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to impugne a thing which is Juris
Divini! But what doth Molin anſwer to this Divinity? Heare him. (Epiſt: 3.)
<hi>Non potui dicere &amp;c: I could not ſay, that the primacy of Biſhops
is Iuris Divini, of divine right, but that I ſhould haue accuſed of
Hereſy our Church, which hath ſhed ſo much bloud for Chriſt: For, to be
obſtinate againſt thoſe things which are of divine right, and to oppoſe
the Command of God, is plainly Hereſy; whether it be in a thing concerning
either Faith or diſcipline. And beſides, I muſt haue overthrowne that
Principle, by which our Religion doth chiefly defend itſelf againſt
Papiſtery: That all things which are Iuris Divint of Divine Lawe are
contayned ſufficiently and evidently in Holy Scripture.</hi> I beſeech the
Reader to obſerue two maine Points: 1. That it is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy to deny any
thing which is Juris Divini, of Divine right, though it belong only to the
diſcipline of the Church; which is very true; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatſoever is
againſt any thing revealed in Scripture, is againſt Faith, and damnable to
be defended, whether it concerne ſpeculation, or practiſe; and to hold that
it is not damnable, to deny a thing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propoſed as revealed by
God, is plaine inſidelity. 2. That to ſay, Epiſcopacy is Juris Divini, is
to grant that not all things which are Juris Divini, are ſufficiently and
evidently contained in Scripture alone, which is the: thing I affirmed in the
beginning of my ſecond <pb n="431" facs="tcp:59214:224"/>Chapter: And ſo Engliſh
Proteſtants, who teach, Epiſcopacy to be Juris Divini, muſt either ſay,
that ſome Point<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ealed by God, is not
evident in Scripture; or els renounce their plea for Epiſcopacy, that it is
Juris Divini. And indeed, as long as they hold it not as a Point of Faith, and
conſequently not neceſſary to be believed, it is all one, as if they did
not hold it to be Juris Divini, becauſe in this caſe, nothing, is as good,
as no certainty. For, it is certaine, and a matter of Faith, that the true
Church muſt haue Biſhops, and to deny it, is an Hereſy in a matter of
greateſt moment, and which ſtrikes at the very roote of Religion; neither
can any true Church communicate, or diſſemble or conniue, with thoſe
Congregations who deny this truth, as our Engliſh Proteſtants doe connive
and communicate with them, and Dr. Andrews expreſſly ſayes may be done;
yea or with thoſe, who hold it to be only probable and the better doctrine,
though not certaine, nor the contrary to be Hereſy; wheras to affirme that
any Article of Faith is only probable, is plaine Hereſy. And in this Point
the Divinity of the French Hugonot Molin is better than that of the Engliſh
pretended Biſhop; I meane for the conſequence which he makes, that if
Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie be Juris Divini it is damnable to impugne it; and with Molin
agrees Dr. Taylor; of Epiſcopacy, teaching §. 46. That <hi>to ſeparate
from the Biſhop, makes a man at leaſt a Schiſmatike,</hi> and §. 47.
That <hi>it is alſo Hereſy.</hi> And in his Liberty of Propheſying,
(Epiſt: Dedic: Pag: 32.33.) having ſayd, that the Lutheran Churches, the
Zuinglians, and the Calviniſts reject Epiſcopacy, he adds; which the
<hi>Primitive Church would haue made no doubt to haue called Hereſy.</hi>
More of this, and of the Notes of the Church, may be ſeene in <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Chap: 9.) this not being a place to treat at large of
theſe matters. It is ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe, to
demonſtrate, that we are no way guilty of walking in a Circle. Only it will
be neceſſary to note here two Points,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Firſt: That the Arguments of credibility fall
primarily vpon the Church, not vpon Scripture: (which confirmes what I ſayd,
that the Apoſtles were not Infallible becauſe they wrote, but their
writings deſerue credit, becauſe the writers were Infallible.) Thus in the
Old Law. Moyſes gained authority by working Miracles, and by other Arguments
of credibility, wherby the people accepted him as a Man ſent by God, to
declare his word and will, and in ſuch manner as they were ſure to belieue
God by giving credit to Moyſes. 
<q rend="margQuotes">They believed <pb n="432" facs="tcp:59214:225"/>our
Lord, and Moyſes his ſervant</q> (Exod: 14.31. and 19.9:) and ther vpon
they belie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed the Scripture
which he wrote, and propoſed as the Infallible word of God, and by it other
particulars, even concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Moyſes himſelf. In the New Law; the
Apoſtles proved and ſettled the Authority of their Perſons, before their
writings could be prudent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly receaved as Diuine, or the Word of God. The
Reaſon therof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Motives or Arguments of credibility,
immediatly make that credible of which they are effects, which immediatly
manifeſt their cauſe. Now the Motives to embrace Religion agree immediatly
to the Church or Perſons, and not to writings, and ſo Marc: Vlt: it is
ſayd; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Theſe ſignes ſhall follow thoſe
who belieue.</q> And therfore, though there were no Scriptures, if the Church
did ſtill remaine, theſe motives would alſo remaine; for example,
Sanctity of life; Miracles; converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nations; Martirdomes; Victory over
all enemyes; the name Catholique &amp;c: Which could not agree to Scripture,
though we did falſely ſuppoſe, that it did remayne, and the Church
periſh. For, no Writing is capable of Sanctity of life, Succeſſion of
Biſhops &amp;c: yea, the Scripture can haue no efficacy, vnless it be firſt
believed to be the word of God, and it muſt be beholding to the Church for
ſuch a Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony; and therfor whatſoever perfections or attributes may
ſeeme to belong immediatly to the Scripture, muſt depend on the Church, as
the Scripture itſelf doth, in order to our believing it to be the word of
God; But contrarily, the Perfections or priviledges of the Church, are
independent of Scripture, as the Church itſelf is, which was before
Scripture. And here it is alſo to be conſidered, that we haue no abſolute
certainty, that the Apoſtles ever wrought any particular Miracle, to proue
immediatly that Scripture is the word of God; but we are ſure, they did it
mediatè, by gaining Authority to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and then to their
writings. And thus you ſay (in your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Direction N. 43.) That
the Bible hath bene <hi>confirmed with thoſe Miracles, which were wrought by
our Saviour and the Apoſtles.</hi> But now, if we be obliged to believe the
Scripture in all things, by reaſon of Arguments which bind vs to belieue it
to be the word of God, we muſt alſo be obliged to belieue the Church, in
whatſoever ſhe propoſes as Divine Verityes, ſince the Arguments and
Reaſons of credibility do more immediatly proue the true Church than they
proue Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſecond thing to be obſerved, is, That when we
are obliged <pb n="433" facs="tcp:59214:225"/>to receave ſome Perſons as meſſengers
of God, appointed and aſſiſted by him to deliver Divine Truths, as the
Apoſtles were; we are bound to belieue them in all things which they propound
for ſuch Truths. For, as I haue often ſayd, if they might erre in ſome
things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we could not belieue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any other thing for their
ſole Authority; as all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fess of Scripture, that being once delivered by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the forſayd Authority as the word of God, it muſt be receyved as
vniverſally true, in all and every leaſt paſſage, though the Apoſtles
did not confirme by ſeve rall Miracles the matter of every particular Text
(and yet every one is an object of Faith) nor of every particular Truth which
they ſpoke; but it was ſufficient that people did, and were obliged to
receaue them, as men who by commiſſion from God, taught the true way to
eternall Happynes, and therfore were to be credited in all particulars which
they did propoſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Out of this true Ground, I inferr; That it cannot be
ſayed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injury to Gods Church, to the Apoſtles, and God himſelf,
that, when men of our Church worke Miracles, and produce other Reaſons, to
proue that they preach the true Faith and Religion to gentils, Jewes, Turks, or
Heritikes, thoſe Miracles are not ſufficient Proofes of all that which our
Church propounds as Divine Truth, but of ſome particular Points; for example,
not of Purgatory, Prayer to Saints, Reall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence &amp;c. but of ſuch
Chriſtian verityes, as Proteſtants belieue with vs. This cannot be ſayd.
For, it is evident, that the ſame might haue bene objected againſt the
Apoſtles, to wit, that God intended to proue by their Miracles, only ſome
verityes believed by Jewes, or Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and not every one of the particular
Myſteryes of Chriſtian Religion. Neither can it be ſayd, that the
Preachers of our Catholique Church, when they convert Nations, doe worke
Miracles to bring them to I know not what Faith in generall, or in abſtracto,
or an Idea Platonica, but to the Catholique Roman Religion, which if it were
falſe, God in his Goodness could never permitt, ſo many and great Miracles
to be wrought, and other ſo evident Arguments of credibility to be produced,
that people muſt be obliged to receiue ſuch Preachers, as Teachers of the
true way to Heaven; as he could not permit the Apoſtles to worke Miracles,
intending that they ſhould be truſted in ſome, not in all Points. For,
this generall Reaſon taken from Gods Goodness and providence, is the ſame
in all who bring the like Arguments of Credibility, as our Church never wants
Arguments like to thoſe, whereby the Apoſtles <pb n="434" facs="tcp:59214:226"/>made
good their Authority. Beſides, if the ſayd Objection were of force, men de
facto can haue no certainty, that Scripture is the word of God for all Points
contayned therin; becauſe it will be ſayd, that although Miracles were
wrought to proue that the Bible is the word of God, they might be vnderſtood,
not to confirme every paſſage or Text, but only ſome Truths contayned
therin. And likewiſe according to this Objection or invention, no certainty
can be had what the Apoſtles or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preachers teach, or teach not, with
infallibility: Nor will there remaine any meanes to convert men to
Chriſtianity. For, every one may ſay, that, not the Poynt which he
apprehends to be falſe, was confirmed by Miracles, but thoſe other
Articles, which he concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to be true: And ſo no Heretike can be convinced
by Scripture, which, he will ſay is not the word of God, except for his
opinions; and ſo nothing will be proved out of Scripture, even for thoſe
things which are contayned in it. Neither will anie thing remayne certaine,
except a generall, vnprofitable, impracticable Notion, that the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
taught, and the Scripture contaynes ſome things revealed by God, without
knowing what they are in particular; which would be nothing to the purpoſe,
and therfore as good as nothing.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But yet, dato, non conceſſo, That the Apoſtles
and the Church are to be believed only in ſuch particular Points, as are
proved by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles &amp;c: we ſay, that innumerable Miracles haue bene
wrought, in conſirmation of thoſe particular Points wherin we diſagree
from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, as may be ſeene in Brierly (Tract: 2. Chap: 3 Sect: 7.
ſubdiv: 1.) For example, of Prayer to Saints (out of S. Auſtine Civit: L.
22. C. 8.) Worſhip of Reliques (out of S. Gregory Nazian: S. Auſtine, S.
Hierom: S. Baſil: Greg: Turonen: Theodoret:) the Image of Chriſt: Reall
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Sacrifice of Chriſts Body; Purgatory, Prayer for the Dead; The
great vertue of the ſigne of the Croſſe; Holy water; Lights in the
Church; Reſervation of the Sacrament; Holy Chriſme; Adoration of the
croſſe; Confeſſion of ſins to a Prieſt, and extreme Vnction; which
miracles Brier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves by irrefragable Teſtimonyes, of moſt creditable
Authors, and Holy Fathers; wherof, if any Proteſtant doubt, he can do no
leſſe for the ſalvation of his ſoule, than examine the matter, either

                  </gap> thefe
conſiderations. 1. That theſe Miracles were wrought <pb n="435" facs="tcp:59214:226"/>and teſtifyed, before any Proteſtant appeared in the world: And
therfore could not be fayned, or recorded vpon any particular deſigne
againſt them, and their Hereſyes. 2. That even Proteſtants acknowledg the
Truths of ſuch Miracles. Whitaker. (cont: Duraeum, Lib: 10.) ſayth; <hi>I
do not thinke thoſe Miracles vaine which are reported to haue bene done at
the monuments</hi> of <hi>Saints:</hi> as alſo <hi>Fox</hi> and
<hi>Godwin</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg Miracles wrought by S. Auſtine (the Monke ſent
by S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Pope, to convert England) through Gods hand, as may be ſeene
in Brierly (Tract: 1. Sect: 5.) and yet it is confeſſed by Proteſtants,
and is evident of itſelf, that he converted vs to the Roman Faith. But, not
to be long, I referr the Reader to Brierly, in the Index of whoſe Booke, in
the word (Miracles) he will find full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, if he examine his
allegations, that in every Age ſince our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, there haue bene
wrought many ad great Miracles, both by the Profeſſors of the Roman Faith,
and expreſſly in confirmation of it. This I ſay, and avouch for a
certaine truth; that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Heretikes can object againſt Miracles
wrought by Profeſſors of our Religion, and in proofe if it, may be in the
ſame manner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt the Miracles of our B. Saviour, and his
Apoſtles; and that they cannot impugne vs, but joyntly they muſt vndermine
all Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To theſe two conſiderations, let this Third be
added; that it is evidently delivered in Scripture, Miracles to be certaine
Proofes of the true Faith and Religion, as being appointed by God for that end.
(Exod: 4.1.) when Moyſes ſayd, 
<q rend="margQuotes">They will not belieue me, nor heare my
voice,</q> God gaue him the Gift of Miracles, that they might belieue God had
ſpoken to him. (3. Reg: 17. Verſ: 24.) That wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe ſonne Elias
had raiſed to life, ſayd; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Now, in this I haue knowen that thou
art a man of God, and the word of our Lord, in thy mouth, is true.</q> Chriſt
(Matt: 11. V. 3.4.5.) being asked whether he was the Meſſias, proved
himſelf to be ſuch by the Miracle; which he wrought 
<q rend="margQuotes">The blind ſee, the lame walke; the
lepers are made cleane, the deafe heare, the dead riſe againe.</q> Which
words ſignify, that Miracles are not only effectuall, but neceſſary to
proue the truth of a Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what was receyved before. Yea
(Joan: 5.36.) Miracles are called, 
<q rend="margQuotes">a greater teſtimony the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> John.</q>
(Marc: vlt:) they preached every where, our Lord working withall, and
conſirming the Word with ſignes that followed. (2. Cor: 12. V. 12.) <hi>The
ſignes of my Apoſtleſhip haue beene done vpon you in all patience, 
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:59214:227"/>and wonders and mighty deeds.</hi> (Hebr. 2.4.) <hi>God
withall teſtifying by ſignes and wonders, and divers Miracles.</hi> But why
do I vrge this Point? You clearly confess it (Pag: 144. N. 31.) in theſe
words; <hi>If you be ſo infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the Apoſtles were, ſhew it as the
Apoſtles did. They went forth</hi> (ſaith S. Marke) <hi>and preached every
where the Lord working with them, and confirming their words with ſignes
following. It is impoſſible, that God ſhould lye, and that the Eternall
Truth ſhould ſet his hand and ſeale to the confirmation of a falſhood,
or of ſuch doctrine as is partly true, and partly falſe. The Apoſiles
doctrine was thus confirmed, therfore it was intirely true, and in no part
either falſe or vncertaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Now, put theſe Truths togeather: Many and great
Miracles haue bene wrought by profeſſours of the Roman Religion, and
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in confirmation of it; Miracles are vndoubted Proofes of the true
Church, Faith, and Religion: What will follow, but that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faith and
Religion is entirely true, and in no part either falſe or vncertaine?
Wherfore men deſirous of their Eternall ſalvation, may ſay confidently
with B. S. Auſtine (Lib: de Vtilit: credendi, Cap: 17.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Dubitabimus nos ejus Eccleſiae
&amp;c. Shall we doubt to reſt in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of that Church, which with
the acknowledgment of mankind, hath obtained the height of Authority from the
Apoſtolique Sea by Succeſſion of Biſhops, Heretikes in vaine barking
about her, and being condemned, partly by the judgment of the people, partly by
the gravity of Councells, partly by the Majeſty of Miracles? To which not to
giue the firſt place, is indeed either moſt great impiety, or precipitous
arrogancie.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Behold the Notes of the true Church, Miracles,
Succeſſion of Biſhops! Which perpetuall Succeſſion of Biſhops, is
the Ground and Foundation of the Amplitude, Propagation, Splendor, and Glory of
the Church, promiſed by God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d foretold by the Prophets, as may be ſeene
Iſaiae (Chap: 60. Verſ: 22. Chap: 2. Verſ: 2. Chap: 49. Verſ: 23. Chap.
54. Verſ: 2.3. Pſalm: 2.8. Dan: 2.44.) Which Promiſes ſome learned
Proteſtants finding evidently, not to be fulfilled in the Proteſtant
Church, which before Luther was none, and being reſolved, not to embrace the
Catholique Church, wherin alone thoſe Promiſes are clearly fulfilled, fell
either to be perplexed and doubtfull of Chriſtian Religion, or vtterly to
forſake it, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d become Jewes, or Turks. Such were Caſtalio, David Georg,
Ochinus, Neuſerus, Alemannus, and others, as may be ſeene exactly ſet
downe in Brierly, (Tract: 2. Cap. 1. Sect. 5.)</p>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:59214:227"/>
               <p n="12">12. Theſe things conſidered, we muſt ſay, that if
it be once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved againſt wicked Atheiſts, that there is a God; that he
hath Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over his creatures, and is to be worſhipped in ſome
Religion; it is impoſſible, that he can beſtow ſo great Prerogatives
vpon the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, and affoard ſo many, forcible, and evident Reaſons
convincing Her to be the true Church, and yet that ſhe ſhould not be ſo
indeed. For, ſuch an errour could not be aſcribed to man, follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the
beſt guidance of evident Reaſon, but to God alone; which cannot be affirmed
without blaſphemy. And how is it poſſible, that Gods will ſhould be,
that we embrace his true Worſhip, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet affoard to the
contrary errour, ſo great ſtrength of Reaſon, that in all prudence and
reaſon, men ſhould embrace, not the true, but the falſe Faith and
Religion?</p>
               <p n="13">13. And this may ſuffice for the preſent to
demonſtrate, that we are free enough from walking in a circle; and that you
ſpeake very vntruly, when you ſay (Pag: 377. N. 59.) and in your Anſwer
to the Direction (N. 8. and 14.) that we can pretend no proofe for the Church,
but ſome Texts; wherin you contradict even yourſelf, who (Pag: 66. N. 35.)
ſay that our <hi>Faith, even of the Fundation of all our Faith, our Churches
Authority, is built laſtly and wholly vpon pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall Motives?</hi> If
wholly vpon prudentiall Motives, how do you ſo often tell vs, that we build
it only vpon Scripture. And that by ſo doing, we run round in a Circle,
proving Scripture by the Church, and the Church by Scripture?</p>
               <p n="14">14. But now, let vs conſider a litle, whether your
pretended Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Proteſtants, can themſelves avoyd that, which you
and they do ſo vehemently object to vs. Firſt then; They who profess to
know the private ſpirit, cannot avoyd a Circle, while they proue Scripture by
that ſpirit, and that ſpirit by Scripture, by which alone, according to
their Principles, they can try whether, or no it proceede from God. Wherof
Ihaue ſpoken heretofore.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Secondly; they who pretend to know the Scripture by
certaine internall criteria, or ſignes found in Scripture itſelf, as light,
majeſty, efficacy, or, as Potter ſpeakes (Pag: 141.) <hi>a glorious beame
of divine light which ſhines in Scripture,</hi> muſt fall into the ſame
Circle with thoſe men of the private ſpirit. For, ſeing thoſe criteria,
which they fancy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are nor evident either to ſenſe, or
naturall reaſon, they muſt be knowen by ſome other meanes, which can be
none except ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <pb n="438" facs="tcp:59214:228"/>private ſpirit, or Grace
within, as Potter expreſſly ſpeakes (Pag: (141.) and (Pag: 142.) ſaith,
<hi>There is in the Scripture it ſelf, light ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, which the eye of
Reaſon cleared by Grace, may diſcover to be Divine, deſcended from the
Father and fountaine of light.</hi> If then we aske theſe men, why they
belieue Scripture to be indued with ſuch light, majeſty, &amp;c. ſeing
theſe things appeare not evidently to any of our ſenſes, nor to our
vnderſtanding, as prima principia of naturall Reaſon which are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
of themſelves; their Anſwer muſt be, that internall Grace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſures vs
therof, and ſo this Grace is neceſſary, not only ex parte ſubjecti or
potentiae, to aſſiſt our ſoule aboue our naturall forces, in order to
ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Objects; but it is the reaſon, motiue, and medium ex par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
objecti, for which we belieue; for, other reaſon theſe men can giue none;
and then enters the Argument which I made even now. How can they know that this
light, or ſpirit is infuſed by God, (and proceeds not from ſome bad
ſpirit) except by Scripture, and conſequently by firſt knowing Scripture,
wherby that light muſt be examined? and yet they cannot know ſcripture,
except they be firſt inſpired with this light, and know it to be a true
light and not an illuſion; which is a manifeſt Circle, placing this light
before Scripture, and Scripture before this light; and finally, they are in
effect, caſt vpon the private ſpirit. Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, I grant, belieue that
the particular aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt is neceſſarie for
exerciſing an Act of Faith, but they require it only ex parte potentiae, to
enable our vnderſtanding to aſſent to an object, repreſented and
propoſed by Motives ſufficient to oblige vs to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Act, having
for its principall and formall Object, the Divine Revelation, which Revelation
and Motives, are adequately and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſtinguiſhed from the ſayd
Aſſiſtance; as in proportion we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue by the vertue and ſtrength of
the Habit of Faith ex parte poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, but we do not belieue for it, neither
is it apprehended, or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or repreſented to our vnderſtanding,
when we belieue; but that which we apprehend, moves the Act of our
vnderſtanding, is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and motiue for which we beleeue; as alſo
the facultie of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is neceſſary for vs to belieue, and
yet we do not belieue for, but by it: And therfore Proteſtants avoyd a
Circle, as we evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Thirdly. As for you who profess to belieue the
Scripture for the Church, if you be free from an vnprofitable Circle, we
alſo, who receyue and belieue the Scripture for the Authority of the Church, 
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:59214:228"/>are ſecured from it for the ſame reaſon; and
therfore you muſt either acquit vs, or condemne yourſelf; though you will
never be able to be proved not guilty of vntruth and injuſtice, in objecting
to vs alone, that very thing of which yourſelf are guilty.</p>
               <p n="17">17. But now, becauſe in this Controverſy about the
Church, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſeeke to make great vſe of a diſtinction between
Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and not Fundamentall Poynts, I muſt in the next Chapter ſay
ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therof; that is, wheras <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> hath ſhewed
againſt Dr. Potter, the falſhood and impertinency of that diſtinction, as
it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by Proteſtants; yea and that they contradict themſelves
therin; I will now endeavour to proue that notwithſtanding all that you haue
written in defenſe of the Doctour, the Arguments of <hi>Charity
Maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> remayne in force, as alſo that you, in this matter
contradict both Proteſtants, and yourſelf.</p>

FAITH.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Queſtion concerning Fundamentall and not
Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Poynts of Faith, is ſtated at large by <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> (Chap: 3. N. 2.) The ſumme is. Some Points are called
Fundamentall or neceſſary, becauſe every one is obliged to know and
belieue them expreſſly, and explici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely; and Potter (Pag: 243.) ſpeaking
of ſome Points of Faith, ſayth; <hi>Theſe are ſo abſolutely
neceſſary to all Chriſtians, for attaining the End of our Faith, that is,
the ſalvation of our ſoules; that a Chriſtian may looſe himſelf; not
only by a poſitive erring in them, or denying of them; but by a pure
ignorance, or neſcience, or not knowing of them.</hi> Other Points are called
not Fundamentall, for the contrary reaſon, that men may be ignorant of them,
or not belieue them explicitely, without ſinne and damnation; yet ſo, as
they cannot, without a grievous ſin, be rejected or denyed, whenſoever they
are ſufficiently repreſented to our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as Thruths revealed
by God. For, in that caſe they grow to be Fundamentall, ſo farr, as they
cannot be denyed without damnation. And in this ſenſe, there is no
diſtinction between Fundamentall and not Fundamentall Objects of Faith. Which
is ſo evident, that Potter (Pag: 240.) ſayes; <hi>It is Fundamentall to a
Chriſtians Faith, and neceſſary for his ſalvation, that he belieue all
revealed truths of God, wherof he may be convinced, that they are from
God.</hi> And (Pag: 212.) he teaches, that ſuch Points <hi>may not be denyed
or contradicted without Infidelity.</hi> This he ſayth, and this every one
muſt ſay who vnderſtandes the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. For, to reject what one believes
to be teſtifyed by God, is to thinke <pb n="441" facs="tcp:59214:229"/>that he either
deceives, or may be deceived,</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then, How comes it to paſſe, that when we
object to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, that all of them cannot be of the ſame Church and
Faith, and conſequently cannot all hope to be ſaved, ſeing it is evident
they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict one another in many Points of Faith, wherin one ſide muſt
deny a revealed Truth, which they confess to be damnable; how (I ſay,) come
they to anſwer, not that thoſe Points wherin they differ, are not
ſufficiently propoſed to all of them as revealed by God, and ſo all of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be excuſed by ignorance (which were a poore, and vncertaine, and as
it were a caſuall Anſwer, depending on particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of
perſons, capacityes &amp;c: for which no generall Rule can be given, and they
themſelves often pretend ſome of them to erre againſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when it
is no leſſe evident in ſome not Fundamentall, than it is in ſome
Fundamentall Points, and ſo ignorance cannot excuſe them) but they are wont
only to anſwer, that they agree in all Fundamentall Points, though they
differ in Points not Fundamentall; placing the difference not in the different
propoſition of the Object, but in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or waight of the Objects, or
Articles themſelves. For, if they ſpeake of the propoſall alone, they can
put no difference betwixt not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and Fundamentall Points; ſeing no
man can belieue either kind of thoſe Points, till they be ſufficiently
propoſed, as Potter (Pag: 246. expreſly ſayth: <hi>Sufficient
propoſition of revealed Truths is required, before a man can be convinced.
For, if they be not propounded to me, in reſpect of me it is all one as if
they were not revealed.</hi> And for want of this, he excuſes the Apoſtles
who believed not the Reſurrection, which is a Fundamentall Point of Faith,
and therfore ſufficient propoſall is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in Fundamentall
Articles. What then will Proteſtants finally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer? If they diſagree in
Fundamentall Points, they differ in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Faith, and in things
neceſſary to ſalvation. If they differ in Points not Fundamentall, yet
ſufficiently propoſed, they differ alſo in things which Potter affirmes
to be Fundamentall to a Chriſtians Faith, and neceſſary for ſalvation.
What then remaynes, but that they cannot be of the ſame ſubſtance of
Faith, howſoever they anſwer?</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſee then, how vaine, falſe, diſadvantagious
and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to Proteſtants themſelves, this diſtinction is, as
they apply it; ſeing they muſt ſay, as we haue proved, that errour in
Points not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall is againſt the ſubſtance of Faith, and
deſtructiue of ſalvation, and yet that it is not ſuch, in regard they
affirme, that all of them may <pb n="442" facs="tcp:59214:230"/>be ſaved,
notwithſtanding their errours in Points not Fundamentall; which they cannot
imagine to be poſſible, if an errour in ſuch Points be damnable, as we
haue heard Potter confeſſe it to be, and you alſo ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledg the ſame
in a hundred places of your Booke.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet for the preſent, let vs haue the patience to
heare them ſay, that they agree in Fundamentall Points, and therfore in the
ſubſtance of Faith. But then every one who deſires ſatiſfaction in
this matter, and hath no minde to be fed or rather fooled, with an emptie
ſound of words in the ayre, cannot chuſe, but inſtantly demand, what
thoſe Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Points are in particular?</p>
               <p n="5">5. For, it cannot be diſcerned whether all
Proteſtants, or a few, or any, agree with others, or the ſame man at
different tymes with himſelf in Fundamentall Points, vnless it be knowen,
what thoſe Points be. What would it availe a ſicke perſon, to tell him,
that there are ſome infallible remedyes for his diseaſe, if you cannot tell
him what they are? Catholikes haue often, and earneſtly, vpon moſt juſt
and neceſſary cauſes, vrged Proteſtants to exhibite a Catalogue of
Fundamentall Points; and learned Proteſtants haue endeavoured to give it; but
with ſo great diſagreement among themſelves, and ill ſucceſſe for
their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; that their paines proved advantagious to vs Catholikes alone,
and ſhewed that no ſuch thing could be done; as appeares by their

poſſibly be given; or elſe by contradicting yourſelf, ſomtyme
ſaying, that one can be given, ſomtimes that it cannot. Sure I am, you giue
vs none, though certainly it is a thing very neceſſary to be done in the
way of Proteſtants. (Pag: 201. N. 19.) you teach that <hi>to giue a

to ſet downe an exact Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of Fundamentalls, and proves your requeſt

that will go about to diſtinguiſh, what was written, becauſe it was

intricate peece of buſiness of it, and almoſt imposſible, that he
ſhould be certaine he hath done it, when he hath done it. And then it is
apparently vnneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to go about it.</hi> Are you not an excellent
Advocate for the Protaſtants cauſe? Whoſe both ſayings, and doings, or
endeavours, to ſet downe a Catalogue of Fundamentall Points you contradict;
and make good in fact, (while you giue vs no ſuch Catalogue,) and affirme in
express words, that it is not poſſible for them to do it. They, endeavoured
and could not: You, both by reaſon, and experience of their fruitless
pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, will not ſeeme to endeavour it. Their endeavours ſhewed their
judgment, of the great importance, and reall neceſſity therof. You
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving the impoſſibility, are neceſſitated to ſay, it is not of
impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but needless. They in actu exercito; you in actu ſignato, ſhew
it impoſſible to be done. You, I ſay, teach it to be needless, becauſe
you find it to be impoſſible, as Proteſtants would make the world
belieue, that Miracles are ceaſed, becauſe they can worke none: which if
they had hope to do, they would ſoone chang their Doctrine, as you and they
would quickly teach a Catalogue to be profitable, and neceſſary, if you
could make one. The truth is; ſuch a Catalogue is neceſſary in the
principles of Proteſtants who deny the Authority of the Church, and yet being
indeed impoſſible to them (as we ſee by experience in their differences,
and your express confeſſion) it ſhewes in what deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate caſe they,
and you are. But heere I muſt by the way note a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of yours. We
haue heard you ſay (Pag: 134. N. 13.) <hi>that may be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and
neceſſary to one, which to an other is not ſo.</hi> Which is repugnant to
what you ſay (Pag: 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

20.) <hi>Points Fundamentall be thoſe only which are revealed by God, and
commanded to be preached to all, and believed by all.</hi> For if Fundamentall
Points be ſuch only, as muſt be believed by all, it is cleare, that they
which are neceſſary to be believed not by all, but by ſome only, cannot
be Fundametall. You alſo contradict Potter, who (Pag: 21<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.) teaches that by <hi>Fundamentall Doctrines we
meane ſuch Catholique verities as are neceſſary to be diſtinctly
believed by every</hi> (mark, every) <hi>Chriſtian that will be

               </p>
               <p n="7">7 Now, That ſuch a Catalogue is needless, you would
ſhew, as I ſayd, becauſe who ſoever believes the Scripture, which is
evident in all neceſſary Points, and in many which are not neceſſary,
ſhall be ſure to belieue, all that is neceſſary, and more.</p>
               <pb n="444" facs="tcp:59214:231"/>
               <p n="8">8. This evaſion I haue confuted allready; yet in this
particular fit occaſion, I muſt not omitt to ſay ſomthing.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Firſt then in ſaying a Catalogue is needless, you
contradict other Proteſtants, to whom I ſuppoſe you will deferr ſo
much, as to thinke their opinion not voyd of all probability, and
conſequently your owne not to be certaine, which were only to any purpoſe.
For, if the contrary chance to be true, and a Catalogue be really
neceſſary, your Doctrine denying, both that it is neceſſary, or that it
can be given, muſt be very pernicious to ſoules, deceaving them with an
opinion, that that is neither neceſſary, nor poſſible, which yet is
abſolutely neceſſary for their ſalvation. In the very ſentence or
Motto before your Booke, you alledg Caſaubon ſaying, Exiſtimat ejus
Majeſtas &amp;c. <hi>His Majeſty jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that the number of things
abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation is not great, and therfore that there
is not any more compendious way to make an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than carefully to
diſtinguiſh between neceſſary and vnneceſſary things, and that all
endeavour be vſed to procure an agreement in things neceſſary.</hi> Do
not theſe words ſignify, both a poſſibility and neceſſity of
diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing between neceſſary and vnneceſſary Points? And yet
we haue heard you ſay, that it is both impoſſible, and vnneceſſary;
in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to your Motto. And you ſay in your Epiſtle
Dedicatory to the King, that your Booke is <hi>in a manner nothing elſe but a
ſuperſtruction vpon that bleſſed Doctrine where with</hi> you <hi>haue
adorned and armed the frontiſpice of your Book, and which was recommended
by</hi> King James, <hi>as the only hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, of healing the breaches
of Chriſtendome.</hi> A ſtrang cure, by that meanes only, which you hold to
be vnneceſſary, and impoſſible! And here, by occaſion of mentioning
Caſaubon, I cannot omit to declare (for a warning to others) that I haue it
vnder the hand of a perſon of great quality, and integrity, that that vnhappy
man, finding himſelfe in danger of death, dealt with the ſayd worthy
perſon, to procure the preſence and help of a Catholick Prieſt: but his
intention being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, or ſuſpected, he was ſo beſieged by his

                  </gap> even a Definition or
Deſcription of <pb n="445" facs="tcp:59214:231"/>Points Fundamentall, and not
Fundamentall; or of even mentioning ſuch a diſtinction; ſeing in
practiſe you cannot by any ſuch deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſtinction, know when
they offer themſelves in particular, and you are ſure not to miſſe of
them, by believing all that is cleare in Scripture: Eſpecially if we adde
your words (Pag: 23. N. 27.) <hi>That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants giue you not a Catalogue
of Fundamentalls, it is not from Tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, but from Wiſdome and
Necesſity. And when they had done it, it had been to no purpoſe; There
being, as Matters now ſtand, as great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesſity, of believing thoſe
Truths of Scripture, which are not Fundamentall as thoſe that are.</hi> And
yet all learned Proteſtants harpe vpon nothing more, than vpon this
diſtinction of Points Fundamentall, and vpon the definitions, or
deſcriptions of them, as particularly, may be ſeene in your client Potter
(Pag: 211.213.214.215.) which is a needless paynes, if this your evaſion be
good, and ſolid.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Thirdly. Though one be obliged not to disbelieue any
Truth revealed in Scripture, when it is knowne to be ſuch, yet he is not
bound to belieue explicitly all ſuch Truths. For, by this Fundamentall and
not fundamentall points are diſtinguiſhed, as Potter (P: 213.) ſaith:
<hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall properly is, that which Chriſtians are obliged to belieue
by an express and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Faith. In other Points that Faith, which the Card:
Perron</hi> (Replique Liur: 1. Chap 10. <hi>calls the Faith of adherence, or
non-repugnance, may ſuffice, to wit, an humble preparation of mynd to belieue
all, or any thing revealed in Scripture, when it is ſufficiently
cleared.</hi> Now if I cannot ſever or diſtinguiſh theſe two kinds of
Points, I ſhall either be obliged to know abſolutely all, and every Truth,
contained in Scripture (which is a voluntary, and intollerable obligation) or
none, (ſeing I cannot tell in particular what they be which I am obliged to
know) and ſo be in danger to be ignorant of fundamentall Articles, without
the actuall and express knowledg wherof, I cannot be ſaved. And this
difficulty is encreaſed by the doctrine which you deliver (Pag: 195. N. 11.)
That there is <hi>no Point to any man, at any tyme, in any circumſtances
neceſſary not to be disbelieved, but it is to the ſame man, at the ſame
tyme, in the ſame circumſtances, neceſſary to be believed.</hi> Seing
then no point of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can at any tyme, in any circumſtances, be
disbelieved, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at all tymes, in all circumſtances, to be
believed: And much more this muſt follow, if we cannot know what points be
Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, except by knowing every plain Text of Scripture: which, as I
ſayd, is an intollerable burthen.</p>
               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:59214:232"/>
               <p n="12">12. Fourthly; It imports very much to know ſummarily,
and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, what points men are obliged to belieue explicitly, that they
may with more facility, application, and perfection, learne them, and not be
diverted by things not neceſſary, with prejudice to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of
Articles Fundamentall, or neceſſary, by obliging every one to know every
Text of Scripture. Neither can you anſwer; that this is done already in the
Creed of the Apoſtles. For, we haue that forme of Creed, by Tradition only,
and according to your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, we cannot belieue any thing contained in the
Creed, except we firſt know it to be contained in Scripture, from which if we
cannot learne, what is Fundamentall, and what is not, we cannot be certaine
that the particular points contained in the Creed. are Fundamentall; nor can
you learne out of any text of Scripture that the Creed containes all
Fundamentall points: to ſay nothing, that the Creed, without the Church and
Tradition, is not ſufficient to declare the meaning of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and ſo we
ſee, Proteſtants cannot agree in the ſenſe of any one Article therof,
as I ſhewed hertofore. Beſides, if the Creed containe all Fundamentall
Points, why do you deny that it is poſſible to giue ſuch a Catalogue? Or
if you ſay, that even in the Creed, it is impoſſible to determine
preciſely, what Points are Fundamentall; my former Argument retaines its
force, that by this meanes, one cannot tell what he is chiefly to ſtudy and
learne, nor what he is bound explicitly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue in the Creed itſelf. Nay,
ſince you can alledg no precept out of Scripture, that all men are obliged to
know and belieue the Creed, the Creed of itſelf can be to you no rule at all,
either for Fundamentall; or not Fundamentall Points, but ſtill you are
devolved to find in the whole Bible Fundamentall Articles of Faith, mixt with
Points not Fundamentall; and ſo it availes Proteſtants nothing, to alledg
the Creed as a ſummary of all Fundamentall Points. Laſtly Potter (Pag:
241.) holds it only for very probable, that the Creed containes all
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Points, and yourſelf (Pag: 194. N. 4.) ſay of Potter: <hi>he
affirmed it not as abſolutely certaine, but very probable;</hi> as alſo rhe
Doctour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends only, that all Articles of pure Faith, but not of practiſe
are, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Creed, and yet no man can be ſaved without believing
all Fundamentall points, whether they be purè credenda, or belong to
practiſe; and therfore we muſt conclude, that to alledg the Creed for
ſolving this my Argument, can in no wiſe ſatisfy.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Fiftly; According to Proteſtants, we cannot be
obliged to belieue explicitely any Object, vnless we find ſuch an obligation
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <pb n="447" facs="tcp:59214:232"/>ſet downe in Scripture: And if ſuch an
obligation be evidently expreſſed in Scripture, it followes, that you may
giue vs a Catalogue of ſuch Points: If not; you cannot burden mens
conſciences with ſuch an obligation not expreſſed in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Sixthly; I oppoſe yourſelf to yourſelf. (Pag:
149. N. 37.) You ſpeake of Proteſtants in this manner: <hi>Seing they
ground their belief, that ſuch and ſuch things only are Fundamentalls, only
vpon Scripture, and go about to proue their Aſſertion true, only by
Scripture, then muſt they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Scripture true abſolutly and in
all things, or elſe the Scripture could not be a ſufficient warrant to them
to belieue this thing, that theſe only Points are Fundamentall.</hi> Which
words ſeeme to ſignify, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants can proue out of Scripture,
that <hi>ſuch and ſuch things only are Fundamentalls;</hi> and what is
this, but to giue a Catalogue, ſo exact, that they may not only ſay;
theſe Points are Fundamentall, but alſo that theſe only are ſuch; that
is, theſe, and neither more, nor fewer than theſe are Fundamentall
Articles? And (Pag: 150. N. 40.) You ſay: <hi>They</hi> (Proteſtants)
<hi>may learne of the Church, that the Scripture is the word of God, and from
the Scripture that ſuch Points are Fundamentall, others are not ſo.</hi>
And (Pag: 408. N. 35.) You tell <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> that he overreaches
in ſaying that Proteſtants <hi>cannot agree what Points are
Fundamentall,</hi> and yet you grant in the ſame place, that they do not
agree; and what reaſon can be given of this their ſo conſtant and long
continued diſagreement, except becauſe they haue no aſſured mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and rule how to do it? Alſo (Pag: 160. N. 53.) To theſe words of
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Chap: 3. N. 19.) <hi>Scripture doth
deliver di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths, but ſeldome qualifyes them, or declares whether they
be or be not abſolutly neceſſary to ſalvation)</hi> You anſwer:
<hi>Yet not ſo ſeldome, but that out of it I could giue you an abſtract
of the eſſentiall parts of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity if it were neceſſary.</hi>
What difference put you between an <hi>abſtract of the Eſſentiall parts
of Chriſtianity,</hi> and a Catalogue of Fundamentall Points? And how agrees
this, with what we haue heard you ſay (Pag: 166. N. 59.) <hi>We know not
preciſely juſt how much is Fundamentall.</hi> And (Pag: 23. N. 27.) You
ſay; <hi>He that will goe about to diſtinguiſh, what was written
becauſe it was profitable, from what was written becauſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
ſhall find an intricate peece of buſineſſe of it, and almoſt
impoſſible that he ſhould be certaine he hath done it, when he hath done
it.</hi> And (Pag: 22. N. 27.) A little before the words I cited laſt,
treating whether it be poſſible and neceſſary to giue a Catalogue of
Fundamentalls, you ſay; <pb n="448" facs="tcp:59214:233"/>
                  <hi>For my part, I haue great
reaſon to ſuſpect it is neither the one nor the other.</hi> What a
confuſion is here? Firſt: It is poſſible, it is not poſſible to
giue a Catalogue of Fundamentalls. 2. It is poſſible to giue an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
of the Eſſentiall parts of Chriſtianity. 3. (Pag: 135. N. 14.)
<hi>Perhaps we cannot exactly deſtinguiſh in the Scripture what is revealed
becauſe it is neceſſary, from what is neceſſary conſequently and
accidentally, meerely becauſe it is revealed.</hi> 4. I ſuſpect that it
is neither neceſſary, nor profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to giue a Catalogue of Fundamentall
Points. 5. It is a buſiness of extreame difficultie. 6. it is an intricate
peece of buſiness, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible that one ſhould be certaine
he hath done it, when he hath done it. By all which you can gather nothing but
contradictions and ambiguityes, an Affirmation, a Negation, a Perhaps, a
Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, an extreme Difficulty, an intricate peece of buſineſſe, a
Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, an impoſſibility, an almoſt Impoſſibility, and
finally, nothing certaine but this, that in this moſt important matter of
Fundamentall Points, Proteſtants neither haue, nor can haue any certainty,
but that it may be ſo, and ſo, it may be neither ſo, nor ſo; as we
ſee by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that they do not only diſagree in aſſigning what
Points are Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, but ſome affirme certaine Points to be Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall
Truths, which others belieue to be Fundamentall errours. But now in an other
reſpect alſo, I oppoſe yourſelf to yourſelf.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Seaventhly; For I muſt vpon occaſion ſtill put
you in mynd, of your doctrine, that it is not a materiall object of our Faith,
to belieue that Scripture is the word of God, and that men are not obliged to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it for ſuch, yea and that they may reject it. This ſuppoſed; it
followes, that I am not obliged, yea that I cannot belieue the contents of
Scripture as divine Truths, whether they be Fundamentall, or not Fundamentall:
And therfore by believing all that is evident in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I can in no wiſe
be aſſured, to believe all Fundamentall Truths. Beſides, according to
Proteſtants, men can know by Scripture only, that there are any ſuch things
as Fundamentall Points of Faith, as yourſelf teach (Pag: 149. N. 37.) In
theſe words; Proteſtants <hi>ground their belief, that ſuch and ſuch
things only are Fundamentalls, only vpon Scripture, and go about to proue their
Aſſertion true, only by Scripture.</hi> Seing therfore you hold, that men
are not obliged to belieue Scripture, it followes, that you are not obliged to
embrace that meanes by which alone you can attaine the knowledg of Points
either Fundamentall or not Fundamentall, and conſequently de facto the meanes
to know all <pb n="449" facs="tcp:59214:233"/>Fundamentall Poynts cannot be, to know and
belieue all that is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contained in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Eightly; and chiefly; I haue proved that all Points
neceſſary to be belieued, are not evidently contained in Scripture; and
therfore by only believing all that is evident in Scripture, a man is not
ſure to attaine, yea he is ſure not to attaine, the knowledg and belief of
all neceſſary Points. But let vs now ſee what you can object againſt
vs.</p>

aſſured, whether, or no they belieue all Fundamentall Points; which,
yourſelf confess, cannot be done except by knowing all evident Texts of
Scripture, to which taske no man can be obliged: To ſay nothing, that
Scripture containes not all neceſſary Points, nor is ſufficient to

               <p n="23">23. Let vs caſt an eye vpon every word. Repentance.
Proteſtants are not agreed wherin true Repentance conſiſts, as may be
ſeene in Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine (de Poenit: Lib: 1. Chap: 7. &amp; Lib. 2 Chap: 4.) and
you in particular hold a Dòctrine different from the reſt, That
Attrition alone is ſufficient, and that, whether it be Attrition, or
Contrition, it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res the extirpation of all vicious habits, which you ſay
is a thing of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and tyme, and cannot be performed in an inſtant;
and what ſinner, though repenting himſelf never ſo hartily at the houre
of his death, can be ſaved with this your kind of Repentance, which at that
houre is an impoſſible thing? From dead works. What will you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by dead works? You know, many chiefe Proteſtants hold, all our beſt works
to be of themſelves not only dead, but deadly ſinnes; and ſo Repentance
of dead workes muſt ſignify, Repentance that ever we haue done any good,
that we haue believed, hoped, and loved God and our neighbour, obeyed our
Parents, kept any of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp;c: And if you conſider the
perſon from whom they proceed; in caſe he be predeſtinated, no ſin can
hurt him whatſoever he doe: To the former, Repentance is needless; to the
latter, fruitless. How then do Proteſtants agree in the <hi>necesſity of
Repentance from dead workes,</hi> or in Repentance itſelf? For the ſecond
Point <hi>(Faith in Chriſt Ieſus, the Son of God and Saviour of the
world)</hi> there is not one word wherin Proteſtants agree, for the
ſenſe. Faith. You ſay; A probable Faith is ſufficient: all others deny
it, profeſſiing, that Chriſtian Faith neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation,
muſt be infalible; and therfory you cannot be ſaved by your kind of Faith,
even by the doome of Proteſtants; and in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, all men who haue
care of their ſoules, ought to deteſt your Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Booke. But do
thoſe other Proteſtants agree among themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, what Faith is
neceſſary, and ſufficient, for ſalvation? They do not. Some hold, that,
Faith neceſſary and ſufficient for Juſtification, is that wherby one
believes certainly, that his ſinnes are forgiven, and that they are forgiven
even by believing ſo; according to which Doctrine, what neceſſity can
there be of Repentance? Seing men are juſtifyed preciſely by ſuch a
Faith: and how then did you tell vs, that Proteſtants agree in the
neceſſity of Repentance from dead works? Of which ſtrang kind of Faith,

by Potter is Thomas Morton, who (in his Treatiſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of

to be God) <hi>are to be accounted the Church of God, becauſe they hold the

not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. Anſwer. You Socinians, who adore naturall reaſon,
and take pleaſure in being eſteemed conſidering men, are much delighted
in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſimilitudes, which make a faire ſhew, and may ſeduce the

for the recovery of the diſeaſed mans health; that is, Scripture to
containe all Points neceſſary to ſalvation, which you know we deny, and
ſay you erre in Theſi. If with Scripture, you would joyne the Tradition,
and Definitions of the Church, your ſuppoſitions were true, and your parity
good; Otherwiſe your receypt cannot haue all neceſſary ingredients.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Secondly: Suppoſe the ſick man had great reaſon
to belieue, that the ground vpon which the Phyſitians build their opinion and
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, <pb n="455" facs="tcp:59214:236"/>were not good, nor ſuch as he had any
obligation at all to credit, what ſick man, if he were alſo wiſe, could
judg their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ſufficient, for an vndoubted direction to the

muſt put you in mynd of your doctrine, that we are not bound to belieue, as
an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Faith, Scripture to be the word of God, but that we may
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it. What then availes it me, towards the belief of ſuch or ſuch
Points, that they are evident in Scripture, if I do not belieue Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
itſelf?</p>
               <p n="27">27. Thirdly: Suppoſe the ingredients were very
ſoveraine and ſufficient in themſelves, but that it were not in the
ſick mans power to procure them, were the ſpeculatiue agreement of the
Phyſitians ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for his recovery? So here. It is impoſſible for
moſt men to know all evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t texts of ſcripture, which yet, according to
your grounds, muſt make vp that number of Truths, wherin one ſhall be
ſure to find all Fundamentall Points; and ſo the agreement of
Proteſtants, that all neceſſary Truths are evidently contayned in
Scripture, is to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſince they cannot diſtinguiſh them
from Points not neceſſary; and for all men to know all Points evident in
Scripture, but not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, is impoſſible; and though it were
poſſible, yet being not of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for any man, even though he be
learned, to know all ſuch Texts, defacto he might without ſinne be ignorant
of neceſſary Points, which he can be certaine to know, only by knowing
abſolutly all cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are places of Scripture, and ſo be damned for want of
believing ſome Point abſolutly neceſſary neceſſitate medij; which
is a plaine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that ſome Points ſhould be neceſſary to
ſalvation, and yet that we are not bound to attaine the knowledg of them; or
that the End, which is the knowledg of ſuch Points, ſhould be
neceſſary, and the only meanes to attaine it, be either impoſſible, or
at leaſt not of obligation to any, as certainly no man is obliged to know

only meanes to know all Fundamentall Points; as in your example, if a ſick

make vſe of that receypt which alone could be effectuall in order to that
end.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Fourthly: Suppoſe I could not take ſuch a
receypt, without danger of drinking poyſon, togeather with the wholſome
ingredients, your ſimilitude which goes vpon the contrary ſuppoſition,
doth cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="456" facs="tcp:59214:237"/>proue nothing. Thus it paſſes in our
caſe. Men left to themſelves, without the Direction and Traditions of the
Church (yea with direct oppoſition to her Definitions and Authority) cannot
chuſe, but by occaſion of reading Scripture alone, fall into many errours
againſt ſome Divine Revelation, delivered either in Scripture, or by
Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that is, in the written or vnwritten word of God; as we ſee by
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of old and new Heretikes, and particularly by the diſſenſions
of Proteſtants, wherof ſome muſt needs contradict ſome Truth delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Gods Word, either by detracting, from, or by adding, to the true ſenſe
therof. Now in divets places you affirme, that every errour contrary to any
revealed Truth, <hi>is in its owne nature damnable</hi> without Repentance; and
you add (Pag: 158. N. 52.) that <hi>for the moſt, part, men are betrayed into
errours,</hi> or <hi>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And therfore the true Concluſion will be, that men preſuming to reade and
interpret Scripture by their owne wit, without depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Church, ought
to conceaue, that they expoſe themſelves to certaine danger, of erring
againſt ſome Divine Truth or Revelation; that is, to a thing <hi>in
itſelf damnable:</hi> Neither can they hope for any helpe from Sectaryes,
whom they ſee infinitly divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And if they take ſuch
men for their Phyſitians, ſome of them will affirme ſome ingredients to
be neceſſary or profitable, which others will ſweare to be ranke
poyſon; and ſo every Proteſtant is left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and a particular
Catalogne of Fundamentalls is neceſſary for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. All which is
ſtrongly confirmed, by calling to mynd, that even the moſt learned
Proteſtants, haue no certaine Rule for interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Scripture. Your
ſuppoſition therfore in the conſult of Phyſitians, that in the receypt,
of which they ſpoke, though perhaps there might be ſome ingredients
ſuperfluoous, yet not hurtfull, cannot be applyed againſt vs, but retorted
vpon yourſelfe; that as in caſe the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceypt did containe ſome
things hurtfull, no man could in conſcience take it; ſo

guilty of the grievous ſinne of Schiſme. And that Proteſtants haue done
ſo, ſhall be demonſtrated in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Title of this Chapter having bene made good at
large by <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Chap: 5.) againſt all that Dr.
Potter could invent, in Defenſe of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: If now I can confute
whatſoever you alledg in Defence of the Doctour; the Arguments and Reaſons
of <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> muſt in all right be adjudged to keepe their
firſt poſſeſſion, and this Truth remayne conſtant; That
Proteſtants, and all others who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves from the Roman
Church, muſt needs be found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the grievous ſin of formall
Schiſme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the beginning <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1.
Chapt: 5. N. 4.) layes this ground; That the Catholique Church ſignifyes One
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Faithfull people, and therfore implyes not only Faith to make
them Faithfull Believers, but alſo Communion, or common v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to make them
One in Charity, which excludes Separation and Diviſion, or Schiſme. This is
a very evident and certaine Truth; and therfore Tertulian (de Praeſcrip: Cap.
41.) obſerves it as a property of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks, that they communicate with all. 
<q rend="margQuotes">Pacem quoque paſſim cum omnibus
miſcent. Nihil enim intereſt illis, licèt diverſa tractantibus,
dum ad vnius veritatis expugnationem conſpirent.</q> Thus we ſee
Proteſtants, will needs call all Brethren, who are not Papiſts. Yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
will not haue Papiſts make a Church diſtinct from them. S. Auſtine was of
an other mynd from Proteſtants; who (de Uera Relig: Cap: 5.) condemnes
Philoſophers, becauſe teaching different things of God, yet they frequented
the ſame ſacrifices; and adds; 
<q rend="margQuotes">So it is believed and taught, that it
is the principall point of mans ſalvation, that there <pb n="459" facs="tcp:59214:238"/>is not an other Philoſophy, that is, ſtudy of wiſdome, and an
other Religion, when they, whoſe Doctrine we approue not, communicate not in
Sacraments with vs.</q> Which Truth S. Auſtine judges to be of ſo great
valve, and neceſſity, and the contrarie ſo pernicious, as he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucheth. 
<q rend="margQuotes">Si hoc vnum tantum vitium
Chriſtianâ diſciplinâ ſanatum videremus ineffabili laude
praedicandam eſſe neminem negare opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teret. And (Lib: 19. cont. Fauſt:
Cap: 11,) he ſayth: Men cannot be joyned into any name of Religion, true or
falſe, vnless they be linked with ſome ſigne or fellowſhip of viſible
Sacraments;</q> Therfore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Sacraments, is eſſentially
neceſſary to vnite the members of One Church, and diſtinguiſh it from
all other. In this manner, (Act: 2. 42. it is ſayd of thoſe firſt
Chriſtians: 
<q rend="margQuotes">They were preſevering in the Doctrine
of the Apoſtles, and Communication of breaking bread, and prayer.</q> Behold
a Communication, not only in Faith, or Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; but alſo in Sacraments and
Prayers. Neither do Proteſtants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this Truth. Molins (Lib: 1. cont:
Perron: Cap: 2.) ſaith: <hi>The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctours are wont to vnderſtand by
the Church, (which oftentymes they call Catholike) the whole Society of
Chriſtian Churches, Orthodox, and ſound in Faith, vnited togeather in
Communion: and they oppoſe this Church to the Societyes of Schiſmatikes,
and Heretiks, which we will not reject.</hi> By which words it appeares; That
the Holy Fathers, and even Proteſtants, make vnity in Communion, againſt
Schiſme, no less eſſentiall to the Church, then in Faith, againſt
Hereſy. Field, (Lib: 1. Cap: 15.) <hi>The Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church
conſiſteth in Prayers and diſpenſation of Sacraments.</hi> And (Lib: 2.
Cap: 2.) <hi>Communion in Sacraments is eſſentiall to the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The reaſon of this Truth is very cleare. For, without
Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Sacraments, Liturgie, and publike worſhip of God, the true
Church cannot be diſtinguiſhed eſſentially from any Schiſmaticall
congregation: Becauſe ſeing Schiſmatiks, as they are diſtinguiſhed
from Heretiks, cannot be diſtinguiſhed by a different Faith, wherin they
are ſuppoſed to agree with Catholiks, they can be diſtinguiſhed, only
by externall Communion; which therfore muſt be eſſentiall to the Church,
as being the thing which alone formally and eſſentially exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Schiſme
S. Auſtine ſpeakes excellently to this purpoſe (Epiſt: 48.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">You are with vs in Baptiſme, in the
Creed, in the reſt of Gods Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: in the ſpirit of vnity, in bond of
peace, finally in the very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church you are not with vs.</q> Which
words declare, that the ſpirit of vnity, and bond of peace, are neceſſary
and eſſentiall to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <pb n="460" facs="tcp:59214:239"/>men members of One
Church. All agree, that to be one Church, there muſt be vnity in Faith; and
ſeing Faith is ordaynd to the ſalvation of ſoules, (1. Pet: 1.9.) by the
true worſhip of God; vnity in this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is no less neceſſary, than
vnity in Faith. The Militant true Church of Chriſt is a viſible
congregation; and therfore doth eſſentially require viſible ſignes to
diſtinguiſh it from all other companyes, by Sacraments, externall worſhip
of God, and a publike Liturgie: which if you take away, you deſtroy the vnity
of the Church. For, a Diviſion of that which is eſſentiall, is a plaine
deſtruction. Proteſtants teach, the true preaching of the word, and due
adminiſtration of Sacraments to be ſo eſſentiall to the Church, that
without them a Church ceaſes to be a Church: therfore if there be not
agreement or Communion in them, they cannot be eſſentially one Church, but
eſſentially different and divided one from another. This true Principle
being ſetled;</p>
               <p n="4">4. The firſt reaſon which <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi>
(Chap: 5. Part: 1. N. 12.) alledges to proue his Aſſertion, is this; Seing
Schiſme conſiſts eſſentially in leaving the externall Communion of
the Viſible Church of Chriſt, and that Luther and his Aſſociars did
ſo (as he proves by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of fact, and by the confeſſions of
Proteſtants, Luther ſaying (in Pràefat: Oper: ſuorum) <hi>in the
beginning I was alone.</hi> And Calvin: (Ep: 141.) <hi>We were forced to make a
ſeparation from the whole world;</hi> beſides the ſayings of other
Proteſtants: it followes that they cannot be excuſed from Schiſme.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Anſwer which may be gathered out of Dr. Potter to
this Reaſon, is; That they left not the Church, but her Corruptions. Which
evaſion, <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> confutes, by willing him to conſider,
that for the preſent we ſpeake not of Hereſy, or departing from the
Church, but of Schiſme, of leaving her externall Communion; which
manifeſtly they did, by ſeparating from all Churches, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
from the Vniverſall Church, which is the moſt formall ſinne of Schiſme.
And indeed they ought to inferr, that the Vniverſall Church is not ſubject
to any errour in Doctrine, and not tell the world, that they forſooke her
Communion for her Errours; ſeing her Communion is never to be forſaken; and
therfore it is not poſſible, that ſhe can giue any cauſe of ſuch a
ſeparation by falling into errour. This we learne of S. Auſtine (Cont:
Parm: Lib: 2. Chap 11.) There is no juſt neceſſity to divide Vnity. And
(Ep: 48.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">It is not poſſible that any may
haue juſt cauſe, to ſeparate their Communion, from the Communion of 
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:59214:239"/>the whole world, and call themſelves the Church of
Chriſt, as if they had ſeparated themſelves from the Communion of all
Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon juſt cauſe. And S. Irenaeus (Cont: Heres: Lib: 4. C 62.) They
can not make any ſo important reformation, as the evill of the Schiſme is
pernicious</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Secondly: <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> proves them to be
Schiſmatikes, by this Argument. Potter teaches, that the Catholique Church,
cannot erre in points of Faith, Neceſſary to ſalvation; and therfore it
cannot be damnable to remayne in her Communion, although ſhe were falſly
ſuppoſed to teach ſome Errours, ſeing they cannot be damnable, and
conſequently cannot yield any neceſſary cauſe to leaue her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but it is cleare, that Luther, and the reſt, left the whole vniverſall
Church, which was extant before them, vnder pretenſe of Errours, which cannot
be Fundamentall; Therfore it is cleare, they left Her without any neceſſary
cauſe. Which I confirme by your owne words, (Pag: 220. N. 52.) where you
ſay; <hi>May it pleaſe you now at laſt to take notice, that by
Fundamentall, we meane all, and only that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and then I
hope you will grant, that we may ſafely expect ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Church which
hath all things Fundamentall to ſalvation; vnless you will ſay, that more
is neceſſary, than that which is neceſſary.</hi> And (Pag: 376 N. 57.)
<hi>he that believes all neceſſary Truth, if his life he anſwerable to
his Faith, how is it posſible he should faile of ſalvation?</hi> Therfore,
ſay I, ſeing the Church vniverſall cannot erre in neceſſary Points,
whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver embraceth her Faith, for as much as belongs to Faith, cannot faile
of ſalvation, vnless you will ſay, that more is neceſſary, then that
which is neceſſary, which are your owne words: You ſay alſo (Pag: 33.
N. 4.) <hi>If a particular man or Church may hold ſome particular Errours,
and yet be a member of the Church vniverſall; why may not the Church hold
ſome vniverſall Errour, and yet be ſhell the Church?</hi> This parity is
none at all: yet ſeing you muſt make it good, I may ſay much more with
all truth, and without any dependence vpon your falſe parity; if the Church
vniverſall may hold ſome vniverſall Errour, (as you confess ſhe may,
which yet indeed is impoſſible) and be ſtill the Church, why may not a
particular man, or Church, hold ſome particular errours, and yet be a member
of the Church vniverſall; and conſequently capable of ſalvation for as
much as concernes his Faith? And therfore none can forſake the Church by
leaving her Communion, and making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no member of Her, for any ſuch
errours as are not oppoſite to a <pb n="462" facs="tcp:59214:240"/>neceſſary Truth,
into which kind of errours, it is confeſſed the Church cannot fall. To
which I may add what youſay (Pag: 35. N. 7.) <hi>if ſome Controverſyes
may for many Ages he vndetermined, and yet in the meane while men be ſaved,
why ſhould, or how can the Churches being furniſht with effectuall meanes
to determine all Controverſyes in Religion, be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation,
the end itſelf, to which theſe meanes are ordayned, being as experience
shewes, not neceſſary?</hi> O, how truly may we ſay; (and happy had your
progenitors bene, if they had done ſo) If for ſo many; Ages before Luthers
pretended Reformation, but true Schiſme, men wrought Miracles, converted
Nations, were eminent for Sanctity, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſalvation, and are eſteemed
Saints in Heaven by our Adverſary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and this in the belief and
profeſſion of thoſe Points, which Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes now profeſſe, how could
any Reformation, or ſeparation, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſince the end itſelf
of ſalvation, to which all meanes are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was not neceſſary, but
was attained without any ſuch Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſeparation?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Like to this Argument of <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> is
another which (N. 22.) he tooke from theſe words of Potter, (Pag: 155.)
<hi>It is comfort enough for the Church, that the Lord in mercy will ſecure
her from all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall dangers, and conſerue her on earth againſt all
enemyes; but ſhe may not hope to triumph over all ſin and error, tell ſhe
be in Heaven.</hi> If it be comfort enough to be ſecured from all capitall
dangers, why were not the firſt pretended reformers content with enough, but
rent the Church, out of a pernicious greedyness of more then enough, or a
pretended deſire to free men from all errour, which cannot be hoped for out
of Heaven? If even the vniverſall Church may not hope to triumph over all
Errour, till ſhe be in Heaven, much less can particular Churches, and men,
conceiue any ſuch hope, and ſo you muſt either grant, that Errours not
Fundamentall, cannot yield ſufficient cauſe to forſake the Churches
Communion, or you muſt affirme, that all Churches may and ought to be
forſaken, and that a man cannot lawfully be of any Church, yea and that every
one is obliged to forſake himſelf, if it were poſſible, for avoyding
errours not Fundamentall. Beſides, as it is not lawfull to leaue the
Communion of the Church for abuſes in life and manners, becauſe we cannot
in this life <hi>hope to triumph over all ſinne,</hi> as Potter ſpeakes;
ſo neither can her Communion be forſaken, for Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours not Fundamentall,
ſeing the Doctor ſaith alſo, that the Church <hi>may not hope to triumph
over all Errours.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="463" facs="tcp:59214:240"/>
               <p n="8">8. Another Argument <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (N. 25.)
tooke from theſe words of Potter (Pag: 75.) <hi>There neither was, nor can
be, any juſt cauſe to depart from the Church of Chriſt; no more than from
Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But to depart from a particular Church, and namely from
the Church of Rome, in ſome Doctrines and Practiſes, there might be juſt
and neceſſary cauſe, though the Church of Rome wanted nothing
neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> Marke what he ſaith. There can be no
cauſe to depart from the Church of Chriſt, and yet he teaches, that the
Church of Chriſt, the vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, may erre in Points not
Fundamentall; therfore errours in Poynts not Fundamentall, cannot be judged a
ſufficient and juſt cauſe to depart from the vniverſall Church; and for
the ſame reaſon, if the errours of the Roman Church be ſuppoſed to be
not Fundamentall, there can be no juſt cauſe to depart from Her: But here
he expreſſly ſpeakes vpon ſuppoſition that the Roman Church
<hi>wanted nothing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation,</hi> and conſequently, that
ſhe did not erre in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Points; therfore there could be no cauſe
to forſake Her. And that Potter affirmes abſolutly in other paſſages of
his Booke, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church doth not erre in Fundamentall Articles,
ſhall be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated herafter; and conſequently, that he contradicts
himſelf, in ſaying, the vniverſall Church cannot be forſaken, and yet
that there might be juſt and neceſſary cauſe to forſake the Church of
Rome, which erres only in Poynts not Fundamentall, as he holds the
vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church may erre: to ſay nothing for the preſent, That Luther
did forſake all Churches, which is to forſake the vniverſall Church; as
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that indeed all Ortodox Churches agreed with the Roman, and ſo to
forſake her, was to forſake all Churches, for which there can be no juſt
cauſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Another evaſion Potter (Pag: 76.) bring to avoyd the
juſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Schiſme: and it is, becauſe they acknowledg the
Church of Rome to be a member of the Body of Chriſt, and not cut off from the
hope of ſalvation. And <hi>this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>cleares vs from the
imputation of Schiſme, whoſe property it is, to cut of from the Body of
Chriſt, and the hope of ſalvation, the Church from which it
ſeparates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. This ſhift is confuted at large by <hi>Charity
Maintayned,</hi> as a ſtrange Doctrine, that men ſhould be Schiſmatiks in
for ſaking a Church, which they judge to want ſomthing that is
neceſſary to ſalvation; and that they ſhould be excuſed from
Schiſme, who forſake her, and yet profess that ſhe hath all things
neceſſary to ſalvation; as if a man ſhould thinke it a 
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:59214:241"/>ſufficient excuſe for his rebellion, to alledg, that
he held the Perſon againſt whom he rebelled, to be his Lawfull Soveraine:
And Dr. Potter thinkes himſelfe free from Schiſme, becauſe he forſooke
the Church of Rome, but yet ſo, as that ſtill he held her to be a true
Church, and to haue all neceſſary meanes to ſalvation. But I will no
further vrge this moſt ſolemne foppery, and do much more willingly put all
Catholikes in mynd, what an vnſpeakeable comfort it is, that our
Adverſaryes are forced to confeſſe, that they cannot cleare themſelves
from Schiſme, otherwiſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by acknowledging that they do not, nor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
cutt off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hope of ſalvation our Church. Which is as much as if they
ſhould in plaine termes ſay: They muſt be damned, vnless we may be
ſaved. Moreover this evaſion, doth indeed condemne your Zealous Brethren of
Hereſy, for denying the Churches perpetuity, but doth not cleere yourſelf
from Schiſme, which conſiſts in being divided from that true Church, with
which a man agreeth in all Points of Faith, as you muſt profess yourſelf to
agree with the Church of Rome in all Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Articles. For otherwiſe
you ſhould cut her off from the hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ſo condemne
yourſelfe of Schiſme. And laſtly, even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this your owne
definition of Schiſme, you cannot cleere your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from that crime,
vnleſſe you be content to acknowledg a manifeſt contradiction in your
owne Aſſertions. For, if you do not cut vs off from the Body of Chriſt,
and the Hope of ſalvation; how come you to ſay (Pag. 20.) that you Judg a
reconcilation with vs to be damnable? And (Pag: 75.) that to depart <hi>from
the Church of Rome, there might be juſt and neceſſary cauſe,</hi> And
(Pag: 79.) That <hi>they that haue the vnderſtanding and meanes to diſcover
their errour, and neglect to vſe them, we dare not flatter them with ſo
eaſy a cenſure</hi> of hope of ſalvation. If then it be (as you ſay) a
property of Schiſme, to cut off from the Hope of ſalvation the Church from
which it ſeparates, how will you cleare yourſelf from Schiſme, who dare
not flatter vs with ſo eaſy a cenſure? And who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that a
reconciliation with vs is damnable? But the truth is, there is no conſtancy
in your Aſſertions, by reaſon of difficultyes which preſſe you on all
ſides, For, you are loath to affirme clearly, that we may be ſaved, leaſt
ſuch a grant might be occaſion (as in all reaſon it ought to be) of the
converſion of Proteſtants to the Roman Church: And on the other ſide, if
you affirme that our Church erred in points Fundamentall, or neceſſary to
ſalvation, you know not how, nor where, nor among what Company of men, to
find a perpetuall Viſible Church <pb n="465" facs="tcp:59214:241"/>of Chriſt before
Luther. And therfore your beſt ſhift is, to ſay, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, as your
occaſions command. I do not examine the Doctours Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is
the property of Schiſme to cut of from the Body of Chriſt, the Church from
which it ſeparates; wherin he is miſtaken, as appeares by his owne example
of the Donatiſts, who were formall and proper Heretiks (as he affirmes,
becauſe they denyed the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of Gods Church, which he ſaith, is in
its nature a formall Hereſy, againſt the Article of our Creed, I belieue
the Catholike Church) and not Schiſmatiks, as Schiſme is a vice diſtinct
from Hereſy. Beſides, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Donatiſts and Luciferians (whom he
alſo al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>edges) had bene
meere Schiſmatiks; yet it were againſt all good Logicke, from a particular
to inferr a generall Rule, to determine what is the property of Schiſme. Thus
farr <hi>Charity Maintayned.</hi> And indeed this might ſeeme a good
Argument; The Church of Rome wants ſomething neceſſary to ſalvation,
Therfore it is lawfull and neceſſary to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Her; but not this. We
haue forſaken the Church of Rome, but yet ſo, as we belieue ſhe wants
nothing neceſſary to ſalvation; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not Schiſmatiques.</p>
               <p n="11">11. A third deviſe Potter hath to cleere Proteſtants
from Schiſme, ſaying; (Pag: 75.) <hi>There is a great difference between a
Schiſme from them, and a Reformation of ourſelves.</hi> But this (ſaith
<hi>Charity Maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> N. 29.) is a ſubtility, by which all Schiſme
and ſin may be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For, no body can intend evill, but for ſome
motiue of Vertue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or pleaſure. And ſince their pretended
reformation did conſiſt, as they gaue out, in forſaking the corruptions
of the Roman Church, the Reformation of themſelves, and their Diviſion from
vs, fall out to be one and the ſelfe ſame thing: and ſo if it was not
lawfull to forſake vs, it was not lawfull to reforme themſelves by
forſaking vs. Beſides, we ſee, the they diſagree infinitely in the
particulars of their pretended Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therfore the thing vpon which
their firſt thoughts did pitch, was not any particular Modell, or Idea of
Religion, but a conceipt, that their moſt neceſſary, and, as I may ſay,
immediate Reformation, did conſiſt in forſaking the Roman Church.</p>
               <p n="12">12. An other argument (<hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> N.
35.) ſets downe in theſe words: It is evident that there was a diviſion
between Luther and that Church which was viſible when he aroſe; but that
Church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſayd to haue divided herſelfe from him, before whoſe
tyme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was, and in
compariſon of whom ſhe was a whole, and he but a Part: 
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59214:242"/>therfore we muſt ſay, that he divided himſelf, and
went out of her; which is to be a Schiſmatique, or Heretique, or both. By
this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Optatus Milevitanus proveth, that not Caecilianus, but
Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus was a Schiſmatique, ſaying, (Lib: 1. cont: Parmen:) 
<q rend="margQuotes">For, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilianus went not out of
Majorinus they Grandfather, but Majorinus from Caecilianus: neither did
Caecilianus depart from the Chayre of Peter, or Cyprian, but Majorinus, in
whoſe Chayre thou ſitteſt, which had no beginning before Majorinus. Since
it manyfeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that theſe things were acted in this manner, it is
cleere that you are heyres both of the deliverers vp (of the Holy Bible to be
burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and alſo of Schiſmatiks.</q> The whole Argument of this Holy
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes directly both againſt Luther, and all thoſe who continue the
diviſion which he began; and proves: That, going out, convinceth thoſe who
go out to be Schiſmatiks; but not thoſe from whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: That to
forſake the Chayre of Peter is Schiſme; yea, that it is Schiſme to erect
a Chayre which had no origen, or as it were predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, before it
ſelfe: That to continue in a diviſion begun by others, is to be heyres of
Schiſmatiks; and laſtly; that to depart from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a particular
Church (as that of S. Cyprian was) is ſufficient to make a man incurre the
guilt of Schiſme, and conſequently, that although the Proteſtants, who
deny the Pope to be ſupreme Head of the Church, do thinke by that Hereſy to
cleere Luther from Schiſme, in diſobeying the Pope: Yet that will not
ſerve to free him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Schiſme, as it importeth a diviſion from the

eloquent, experienced, and learned Proteſtants, Hugo Grotius, confeſſes
that Vnion cannot be hoped for in the Church, except by being conjoyned with

and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of a Part in forſaking the whole, was of force to moue that
bold and obdurate hart of Luther in the middeſt of his full cups, and
ſenſuall pleaſures; and I beſeech all Proteſtants for the loue they
beare to that ſacred ranſome of their ſoules, the Bloud of our
Bleſſed Saviour, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to ponder, and vnpartially to apply to their

Schiſmatiks, at leaſt for dividing themſelves from one another, is
delivered by <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Mamtayned</hi> (Part 1. N. 38. Pag: 203.). For if
Luther were in the right, thoſe other Proteſtants who invented Doctrines
farr different from his, and divided themſelves from him, muſt be reputed
Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks: and, the like Argument may proportionably be applyed to their
further diviſions, and ſubdiviſions. Which reaſon is confirmed out of
Dr. Potter, (Pag: 20.) affirming, that to him and to ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
in conſcience, of the errours of the Roman Church, a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is
impoſſible and damnable. And yet he teaches, as I ſhewe elſwere, that
their difference from the Roman Church, is not in Fundamentall poynts: and
therfore ſeing Proteſtants differ in Points, at leaſt not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
a reconciliation between them muſt be impoſſible and dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nable. Which yet
may be further proved out of Potter, who (Pag: 69.) <pb n="469" facs="tcp:59214:243"/>confeſſeth, that even among Proteſtants, the weeds, thiſtles,
tares, and cockle, are not perfectly taken away, nor every where alike. Now I
aske, whether by reaſon of theſe weeds, Ptoteſtants muſt ſeparate
from one another, or no? If they muſt, there will be no end of Schiſmes,
and Diviſions; and what a Church, or Churches, are thoſe from which, one is
obliged to divide himſelf? If they muſt not ſeparate from one another by
reaſon of errours or weeds, it was not lawfull for them to divide
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from vs; vnless they will returne to ſay, that Proteſtants
are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſeparate both from Catholikes, and from one another; making
e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Schiſmes and Diviſions, not only lawfull, but neceſſary. For
which <hi>Chilling worth</hi> opens a fayre way, (Pag: 292. N. 91.) in theſe
words: <hi>If the Church were obnaxious to corruption</hi> (as we,
Proteſtants pretend it was) <hi>who can poſſibly warrant vs that part of

               <p n="16">16. To theſe reaſons we may yet add what Potter
ſaith: (Pag: 131 and 132.): That the <hi>Donatiſts and Novatians were just
branded for Schiſmatiks, for oppoſing the Church,</hi> and that it will
never be proved, that Proteſtants <hi>oppoſe any Declaration of the
Catholike Church, and therfore are vnjuſtly charged either with ſchiſme
or Hereſy.</hi> But M. Doctor, I beſeech you informe vs, whether Luther and
his followers, did not oppoſe the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and declarations of all Churches
extant before them: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the vniverſall Church? And

of which we ſhall haue occaſion to treate herafter. Particularly that is to
be obſerved which (N. 47, Pag: 221.) et ſeqq. he proves, to wit, that
Luther, and the reſt departed from the Roman Church, and were. Schiſmatiks
for ſuch their diviſion from her Communion. And becauſe ſome
Proteſtants are wont to produce certaine perſons, as members of their
Church; <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Maintayned</hi> demonſtrates, that the Grecians,
Waldenſes, Wickleſſ, Huss, Muſcovites Armenians, Georgians, cannot be
of the ſame Church with Proteſtants: and therfore that Luther and his
followers oppoſed the doctrine, and ſeparated themſelves from the
Communion of all Chriſtian Churches, which cannot be done without Schiſme
and Hereſy, vnless men haue a mynd to deny that there are any ſuch ſins
as Schiſme, and Hereſy. And here I muſt not omit, that 
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:59214:244"/>
                  <hi>Chillingworth</hi> thought it not wiſdome to

the externall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a Church, at leaſt as Dr. Potter vnderſtands
the words, is not the ſame thing: That being done by ceaſing to be a member

of Eaton, written to a private friend of his, as I am moſt credibly informed,
by a Perſon well knowen, to them both, at that tyme, and who ſawe the
letter itſelf: And further affirmes of his owne certaine knowledg, that Mr.
Hales was of a very inconſtant judgment, one yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, for example, doubting
of, or denying, the Bleſſed Trinity, the next yeare, profeſſing, and
adoring the ſame. The ſubſtance of all conſiſts in the firſt; That

Schiſme.</hi> For if you aske the cauſe excuſing from Schiſme their
ſeparation from vs, he will anſwer: The Church was corrupted, and it is not
lawfull to communicate with any Church in her corruptions. This, I ſay, is
his mayne ground, with which his other Momorandums muſt ſtand, or fall. For
if either the Church cannot erre, or els her errours and corruptions be not
ſuch, as can yield juſt cauſe to leaue her externall communion, the
Prelates of <pb n="471" facs="tcp:59214:244"/>Gods Church, may impoſe vpon ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnder
paine of excommuniation, a neceſſity to remaine in her communion, and by
Eccleſiaſticall cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, oblige them to doe that, which otherwiſe
they are by divine Law moſt ſtrictly obliged to performe: And further, if
the ſeparation be cauſeless, the ſeparatiſts from the externall
communion of the Church do jointly leaue the Church, either by profeſſing a
different Faith, or denying obedience, both to the Church, and to God, who
commands vs not to forſake the communion of the Church, faith and obedience
being thoſe requiſites which, ſay you, conſtitute a man a member of a
Church: And ſo all is reduced to your Memorandum: <hi>a cauſeless
ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the externall communion of any Church, is the ſin of
Schiſme.</hi> Yourſelfe ſay expreſſly (Pag: 267. N. 38.) <hi>The
cauſe in this matter of ſeparation, is all in all:</hi> And why then would
you entangle men with I know not what other vnneceſſary, and vntrue
remembrances? But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity hath no Law. You cannot giue any reaſon why
you leaue vs, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet why Proteſtants muſt not leaue one another (ſince
it is cleare that they in diſagree Points at leaſt not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall) and
therfore you fly to other chifts beſides the cauſe; which yet you ſay is
all in all though (Pag: 267. N. 40.) you expreſſly ſay, that the cauſe
or the corruption of our Church is not the only or principall reaſon of your

yet is not the principall reaſon </p>
               <p n="21">21. Now, to that pretended maine ground of yours; <hi>It
is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to profeſſe known errours, or practiſe known
corruptions;</hi> I ſay, That either we may conſider what is true in it
ſelfe, or what in good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence followes from the principles of
Proteſtants, and in particular of Potter and Chillingworth, or, as the
Logicians ſpeake, ad hominem, which are two very differenr conſiderations;
and yet by the aſſiſtance of Gods holy grace, I will ſhew, that
according to both of them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are guilty of the ſin of
Schiſme.</p>
               <p n="22">22. For the firſt; It is moſt true in itſelfe, that
in no caſe it can ever be lawfull to diſſemble, Equivocate, or Ly, in
matters of Faith, and he ſhall be denyed in Heaven, who in that manner denyes
God on earth. But, as I began to ſay aboue, from this very ground we proue,
that the Church cannot erre in ſuch matters. For, ſeing all Fathers,
Antiquity, and Divines, haue hitherto proclaimed with a moſt vnanimous
conſent, that to forſake the externall communion of Gods Viſible Church,
is the ſin of Schiſme; it followes, that there can be no cauſe
ſufficient for <pb n="472" facs="tcp:59214:245"/>ſuch a diviſion, and conſequently,
that ſhe cannot fall into ſuch errours or corruptions, as may force any to
leaue her Communion. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we proue a priori, that the Church cannot
fall into errour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is infallibly aſſiſted by the Holy
Ghoſt: So as it were a poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori, or ab abſurdo, we muſt inferr, that
ſhe is infallible, and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to errour, becauſe otherwiſe we
might forſake her Communion, and men could haue no certainty who be Heretikes
or Schiſmatikes: but all would be obliged to leaue all Churches, ſeing none
are free from errour, and ſo, remaining members of no Church on earth, could
hope for no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="23">23. For this cauſe, in the definition of Schiſme, our
Forfathers never put your limiting particle (cauſless) well knowing, and
taking it as a principle in Chriſtianity, that there could be no cauſe to
forſake the Communion of Gods Church; as, in proportion, if one ſhould
ſay, it is not lawfull to divide ones ſelfe from Chriſt without cauſe,
he ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld inſinuate, that there might be ſome cauſe in ſome caſe
to do ſo: and yet Potter (Pag: 75.) affirmes, That there <hi>neither was, nor
can be any juſt cauſe to depart from the Church of Chriſt; no more than
from Chriſt himſelfe.</hi> Durum telum neceſſitas. It could not be
denyed that Luther departed from all Churches, and ſo there was no
poſſible way to avoyde the note of open Schiſme, but by inventing a new
definition of that crime, and ſuppoſing the poſſibility of a thing
impoſſible, that there may be juſt cauſe of ſeparating from the
Communion of the Church. But while they labour to avoide Schiſme, they broach
a moſt pernicious Hereſy, that indeed there may be any ſuch juſt
cauſe; veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying what S. Hierome ſayth vpon thoſe words of the
Apoſtle, which (a good conſcience) <hi>ſome caſting off, haue
ſuffered ſhipwracke: Though ſchiſme in the beginning may in ſome
ſort be vnderſtood different from Hereſy; yet there is no Schiſme,
which doth not faine ſome Hereſy to itſelfe, that ſo it may ſeeme to
haue departed from the Church vpon good reaſon:</hi> That is, that their
divſion may not ſeeme to be a cauſless ſeparation, as you ſpeake in
your new definition. But I pray you heare S. Auſtine (Lib: 2. Cont: Petil:
Chap 16.) ſaying; <hi>I object to thee the ſin of Schiſme, which thou
wilt deny, but I will ſtraight proue. For thou doſt not communicate, with
all Nations.</hi> To which if you add what he hath (Epiſt: 48.) <hi>It is not
posſible that any may haue juſt cauſe to ſeparate their communion from
the communion of the whole world, and call themſelves the Church of Chriſt,
as if they had ſeparated themſelves from the communion of all Nations vpon 
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:59214:245"/>juſt cauſe:</hi> and (Lib: 2. Cont: Parm: Cap: 11.)
<hi>There is no juſt necesſity to divide vnity.</hi> And (Lib: 3. Cap: 4.)
<hi>The world doth ſecurely judge, that they are not good, who ſeparate
themſelves from the world, in what part of land ſoever.</hi> If, I ſay
you conſider theſe ſayings of S, Auſtine, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion muſt be,
that Luther who divided himſelfe from the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole world, and
all Nations, was a Schiſmatike, ſeing it is not poſſible that any may
haue juſt cauſe to do ſo, as S. Auſtine affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. Obſerue alſo
what this ſame glorious Doctour ſayth (Lib de Vnit: Eccl: Cap: 4.)
<hi>Whoſoever belieue that Ieſus Chriſt came in fleſh, in which he
ſuffered, was borne,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>yet ſo differ from his Body, which is
the Church, as their communion is not with the whole, wherſoever it is
ſpread, but is found ſeparate in ſome part, it is manifeſt that they
are not in the Catholike Church.</hi> Was Luthers communion with the whole,
which was not with any one place, or perſon? Dr. Lawd (Pag: 139.) ſayth
plainly: <hi>The whole Church cannot vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>verſally erre in abſolute Fundamentall Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And therfore
t'is true that there can be no juſt cauſe to make a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me from the
whole Church.</hi> Which muſt be vnderſtood, that abſolutely there can be
no cauſe at all. For it were ridiculous to ſay; There can be no juſt
cauſe to make a cauſeless Schiſme or diviſion, ſeing if there be
cauſe, it is not cauſeless. And it is to be obſerved, that the Reaſon
he gives why there can be no juſt cauſe to make a Schiſme from the whole
Church, is, becauſe ſhe cannot erre in abſolute Fundamentall doctrines,
which ſuppoſes both that ſhe may erre in Points not Fundamentall, and;
that errours in ſuch points cannot yeild ſufficient cauſe to forſake
her communion; which is directly againſt all thoſe who teach that the
Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church doth not erre Fundamentally, and yet that they had cauſe to
forſake her communion, by reaſon of her errours. We muſt therfore
conclude, that ſeing there can be no juſt cauſe to depart from the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, and yet that there might be juſt cauſe to do
ſo, if ſhe were ſubject to corruption or errour, we muſt abſolutely
belieue her to be infallible, and that they who teach the contrary, and vpon
that pretence forſake her communion, are guilty of Schiſme, and
hereſy.</p>
               <p n="24">24. And this is a fit place to put you in mynd of your
doctrine, that the Apoſtles, after the receaving of the holy Ghoſt, and the
whole Church, with them, erred in a point clearly revealed, and commanded by
our Saviour Chriſt, about preaching the Goſpells to gentils. For, this
falſe doctrine ſuppoſed; I aske whether or no, it had been
neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <pb n="473" facs="tcp:59214:246"/>or lawfull to leaue the communion of that
moſt primitiue Church. If it were not lawfull; then errours even in Faith,
affoard not a juſt cauſe to forſake a Church. If you ſay it was lawfull
to forſake the Apoſtles, and the whole Church of their tyme, you
blaſpheme: And yet if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and the whole primitiue Church did
erre, they, that is all Chriſtians, might and ought to haue been forſaken;
and therfore if it were but to avoide this gross abſurdity, we muſt ſay,
that neither the Church of that, nor of conſequent ages, could erre.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Thus much be ſayd in the firſt way: That,
conſidering things as they are in themſelves, the Church might be
forſaken, if ſhe could erre, and therfore becauſe it is moſt certaine
that ſhe can never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, we muſt firmely belieue that ſhe
cannot erre; though indeed I muſt add, that if ſhe could erre, ſhe might,
and might not be forſaken; it being no ſtrang thing, that vpon a falſe
ſuppoſition, contradictoryes may follow: wherof more herafter.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Now let vs ſee, what may be ſayd in the ſecond
way, or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that is, in order to Proteſtants, and their
grounds, or ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem: though I muſt confeſſ, this to be a nice and
difficult vndertaking, by reaſon of their inconſtancy, ſaying, and
vnſaying as they are forced by different, or contrary occaſions, which make
them doe as they can, not what they ſhould, and never hold conſtantly what
they ought.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Firſt then, we ſuppoſe, that the Church out of
which Luther departed, was a true Church for ſubſtance (whether it were the
Roman, or any other Church:) Otherwiſe we muſt ſay, that Chriſt had no
true Church on earth: which you; Potter; and all chiefeſt Proteſtants,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and expreſſly teach, that alwayes there hath been, is, and ever
ſhalbe ſuch a Church, as we haue ſeene aboue. In ſo much as D. Lawd
(Pag: 141.) ſaieth: <hi>All Divines Ancient, and Moderne, Romaniſts, and
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers agree in this, That the whole Militant Church of Chriſt cannot
fall away into generall Apoſtaſy.</hi> And (Pag: 142.) he ſaieth: that
otherwiſe <hi>falſhood in the very Article</hi> (of the Creed, that the
Church is Holy) <hi>may be the ſubject of the Catholike Faith, which were no
leſſe then Blaſphemy to affirme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. Secondly; Hence it followes, that ſhe did not erre
in any Fundamentall Point, every one wherof, vtterly deſtroyes the Church,
but that her (falſly) ſuppoſed errours were only in Points not
Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Thirdly; That if ſuch errours in Points not
Fundamentall do <pb n="474" facs="tcp:59214:246"/>not exclude ſalvation, men may be
ſaved without profeſſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary truths, it being impoſſible
that one belieue an errour, and alſo the truth contrary to that errour: and
therfore, if the errour be not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructiue of ſalvation, it is
impoſſible that the contrary truth be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therto.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Fourthly; If therfore we can ſhew that according to
Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, errours in Points not Fundamentall, deſtroy not ſalvation,
it will follow of it ſelfe, that, in their grounds, they might, and ought to
haue remayned in the externall communion of the viſible Church,
notwithſtanding ſuch errours; ſince by ſo doing, they had wanted
nothing neceſſary to ſalvation; nor done any thing incompatible
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. For which, we take your owne words (Pag: 272. N. 53.) <hi>It
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes every man who ſeparates from any Churches communion, even as much
as his ſalvation is worth, to looke moſt carefully to it, that the cauſe
of his ſeparation be juſt and neceſſary: For, vnless it be
neceſſary, it can very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſufficient.</hi> And, ſay I, how can
it be neceſſary, if one may be ſaved without it? Let vs now ſee what
Proteſtants hold in this matter.</p>
               <p n="31">31. I grant, that ſomtyme in words they will ſeeme to
teach, that it is neceſſary to belieue, whatſoever is revealed by God, if
it be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed. But if we reſpect their deeds, and
conſider other grounds of their Doctrine, it will appeare, that they muſt
hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that in express words they ſomtyme actually declare
ſo much. Neither ought this to ſeeme any ſtrang thing: ſince Heretiks
muſt ſay and vnſay, to helpe a bad cauſe, as well as their witts will
ſerue them. In which reſpect, I could never much approue the great paines
which ſome Catholike Divines imploy, to proue that Heretiks hold this, or
that, becauſe ſomtyme they deliver expreſſions contrary to that of
which it is diſputed, whether or no it was their Opinion. For, all that can
be inferred from ſuch their different ſayings, is (not that they held
determinately this, and not that, but only) that indeed they contradicted, and
by Gods juſt judgment deſtroyed themſelves</p>
               <p n="32">32. Well then, that it is neceſſary to beleeue
whatſoever is revealed by God, and ſufficiently propounded, Potter (Pag:
245. affirmes in theſe words: <hi>It ſeemes Fundamentall to the Faith, and
for the ſalvation of every member of the Church, that he acknowledge and
belieue all ſuch Points of Faith, as wherof he may be ſufficiently
convinced that they belong to the Doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt. For he that 
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:59214:247"/>being ſufficiently convinced, doth oppoſe, is
obſtinate, an Hereticke, and finally ſuch a one as excludes himſelfe out
of Heaven, wherinto no willfull ſinner can enter.</hi> And (Pag: 250.) <hi>It
is Fundamentall to a Christians Faith, and neceſſary for his ſalvation,
that he belieue all revealed truths of God, wherof he may be convinced, that
they are from God.</hi> And herupon <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi> (Pag: 11.) ſpeaks
to <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in this manner: <hi>It amazed me to heare you
ſay, that he</hi> (Dr. Potter) <hi>declines this question, and never tells
you whether or no there be any other Points of Faith, which being
ſufficiently propounded as divine Revelations may be denyed and
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed. He tells you plainly there are none ſuch. Againe it is almost
as strang to mee, why you ſhould ſay, this was the only thing in
queſtion, whether a man may deny or diſbelieue any Point of Faith,
ſufficiently preſented to his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as a truth revealed by God.
Produce any one Proteſtant that ever did ſo, and I will giue you leaue to
ſay, it is the only thing in question.</hi> Thus hee.</p>
               <p n="33">33. To which I anſwer: That the ſtate of the
Queſtion being, whether both Catholiks and Proteſtants be capable of
ſalvation, in their ſeverall Faiths and Religions (and the ſame reaſon
is of all who differ in any matters of Faith, though of themſelves they be
not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall) and Proteſtants judging vs to be very vncharitable in
ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they cannot be ſaved, ſeing they hold the Creed, and all
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Points (as they conceaue) and therfore if they be in errour, it
is only in Points not Fundamentall; <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſaid, that
Potter never anſwered to this Point clearly, directly, and conſtantly, as
he ought to haue done; that is, he never declared, whether diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent beliefe
in Points not Fundamentall, doth ſo deſtroy the vnity of Faith in perſons
ſo diſagreeing, as that they cannot be ſayd to be of one Faith for the
ſubſtance, or of one Church and Religion, in ſuch manner as one might
abſolutly ſay, Catholiks and Proteſtants are of one Faith and Church, and
capable of ſalvation in their ſeverall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs and profeſſions of
Faith. This, Potter never did, nor in policy durſt doe, becauſe ſaith
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Pag: 3.) <hi>He was loath to affirme
plainly, that generally both Catholiks and Proteſtants may be ſaved: And
yet ſeeing it to be moſt evident that Proteſtants cannot pretend to haue
any true Church before Luther, except the Roman, and ſuch as agreed with her,
and conſequently that they cannot hope for ſalvation, if they deny it to
vs, he thought beſt to avoid this difficulty by confuſion of Language, and
to fill vp his Booke with Points which make nothing to the purpoſe.</hi>
Beſides, if once he grant, that difference of belief, though 
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59214:247"/>it be only in Points not Fundamentall, deſtroy the true
Faith, Church, and Religion, he could not pretend, that Proteſtants
diſagreeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, could be all of one Church, or ſubſtance
of Faith, and Religion, and capable of ſalvation. What remedy then, but that
he muſt contradict himſelfe, accordingly as he might be preſſed by
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, or contrariety, of difficultyes; and ſo by vttering
contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſay <hi>Nothing at all</hi> to the maine queſtion; (or els
ſpeak equally in favour of both Contradictories.) For, what implyes
contradiction, implyes only nothing. But let vs go forward, and add to what we
haue already cited out of <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> his other words (Pag: 21.)
<hi>If any Proteſtant or Papiſt be betrayed into, or kept in any errour, by
any ſin of his will, (as it is to be feared many millions are) ſuch errour
is, as the cauſe of it, ſinfull and damnable.</hi> The ſame doctrine he
pretends to deliver through his whole Booke; wherby it ſeemes that both he
and Potter hold (in words) that to belieue any errour againſt Divine
Revelation ſufficiently propounded, is ſinfull and damnable, and
deſtroyes the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith, being as <hi>Chilling:</hi> ſaith (P.
11.) no less, <hi>than to giue God the ly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="34">34. Nevertheless it is evident that in reality and deeds,
yea and in express profeſſion, they and other Proteſtants, do, and
muſt, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the contrary, vnless they haue a mynd to contradict
themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, in Points of heigh concernment for their cauſe. This I proue
by theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Firſt: The World knowes, that nothing is more
frequent in the mouth of Proteſtants, than that they all hold the ſame
ſubſtance of Faith, and retaine the eſſence of a true Church, becauſe
they agree in Fundamentall Points, which they are wont to proue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they belieue the Apoſtles Creed, and the foure firſt Generall Councells;
and Potter in particular (Pag: 216.) teaches, that the Creed of the Apoſtles,
<hi>as it was further opened and explained in ſome parts (by occaſion of
emerfent Hereſyes) in the other Catholike Creeds of Nice Conſtantinople,
Ephepſus, Chacedon, and Araneſius</hi> containes all funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall truths;
and from thence inferrs (Pag: 232. that Proteſtants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in fundamentalls:
and (Pag: 241.) he ſaith, <hi>the Creed is the perfect Summary of thoſe
fundamentall truths, wherin conſiſts the vnity of Faith, and of the
Catholique Church.</hi> But theſe aſſertions were very falſe, and
impertinent, if it be damnable, and even Fundamentall againſt Faith, to
belieue any errour repugnant to. Divine Revelation, though in a Point not
Fundamentall of itſelf. For, what imports <pb n="477" facs="tcp:59214:248"/>it, to
belieue all the Articles of the Creed, if in the meane tyme, they deny ſome
other truths revealed by God, and ſufficiently propoſed for ſuch; for
example, innumerable Texts of Scripture containing no matters, Fundamentall of
themſelves? As certainly ſome Proteſtants muſt doe, ſeing two
contradictoryes cannot be true. Or why do they deceaue men, in telling them,
that by believing the Creed, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre Fundamentally; ſeing they hold
that there are millions of truths which to deny were a damnable and
Fundamentall errour? If therfore they will keepe this ground, that they haue
the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Faith and hope of ſalvation, becauſe they
agree in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Points, they muſt affirme, that diſagreement, or
errour in a Point not Fundamentall, doth not deſtroy the ſubſtance of
Faith, or depriue men of hope to be ſaved, nor is a Fundamentall errour, as
<hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Chilling:</hi> ſomtyme ſay it is, as we haue
ſeene; and <hi>Chilling:</hi> ſaith in particular, (Pag: 131. N. 9.) <hi>If
Proteſtants differ in Points Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, then they are not members of the
ſame Church one with another, no more than with you</hi> (he meanes, vs
Catholikes.) Wherfore vpon the matter, if to deny Points of themſelves not
Fundamentall ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently propounded, be a Fundamentall errour, de facto
Proteſtants <hi>are not members of the ſame Church one with another,</hi>
according to <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths</hi> owne words. If it be not a Fundamentall
errour, the contrary Truth is not neceſſary; and ſo one may be ſaved,
though he deny ſome revealed Truth ſufficiently propounded; which is the
thing I intended to proue.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Secondly. Learned Proteſtants are very deſirous,
and even ambitious, that the world ſhould belieue them to be of the ſame
Church with the Roman; and this meerly vpon neceſſity, and for their owne
ſake; leaſt otherwiſe they ſhould be neceſſitated to affirme, that
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Luther there was no true Church vpon earth, but that he and his
followers created a new Church out of nothing; from which, Potter vtterly
diſclaimes (Pag: 59.) ſaying; <hi>Proteſtants never intended to erect a
new Church, but to purge the old; the Reformation did not change the
ſubſtance of Religion.</hi> And (Pag: 63.) <hi>The moſt neceſſary and
Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall truths, which conſtitute a Church, are on both ſides
vnqueſtioned: And for that reaſon, learned Proteſtants yield them the
name and ſubſtance of a Chriſtian Church, though extremely defiled with
horrible errorurs and corruptions:</hi> And adds, that, <hi>The very
Anabaptists grant it.</hi> But how can they be of the ſame Church for
ſubſtance with vs, who, they ſay, <pb n="478" facs="tcp:59214:248"/>are <hi>defided
with horrible errours and corruptions,</hi> if every errour in any Point of
Faith, though not Fundamentall, deſtroyes the ſubſtance o Faith and
Church, and poſſibility of ſalvation? If then they will ſpeake with
conſequence to themſelves, they muſt affirme, that, errours in Points not
Fundamentall, do not exclude ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Thirdly: Proteſtants teach, that the Church may
erre in Points not Fundamentall, and yet remaine a Church, but cannot erre in
Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls without deſtruction of herſelfe. Now, if ſinfull errours
in Points not Fundamentall, be damnable, Fundamentall, and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of
ſalvation, they alſo deſtroy the eſſence of the Church; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Proteſtants muſt either ſay, that the Church cannot erre in any Point
though not Fundamentall, as ſhe cannot erre in Fundamentalls; or elſe
muſt affirme, that ſinfull errours not Fundamentall, are not damnable, or
Fundamentall, or deſtructiue of ſalvation, according to their grounds.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Fourthly; Proteſtants are wont to ſay (and by
this, ſeeke to excuſe their Schiſme) that they left not the Church of
Rome, but her corruptions; and that they departed no farther from her, than
ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from herſelfe: But if every errour againſt a Divine Truth
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed, be deſtructiue of the ſubſtance of Faith, and
hope of ſalvation, the Roman Church (which you ſuppoſe to be guilty of
ſuch errours) hath ceaſed to be a Church, and is no corrupted Church, but
no Church at all, nor doth exiſt with corruptions, but by ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
hath ceaſed to exiſt; and ſo you departed not only from her corruptions,
but from herſelfe, or rather ſhe ceaſing to haue any being, your not
communicating with her, was totall, and not only in part, or in her
corruptions: and if you departed from her, as farr as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from
herſelfe, ſeing ſhe departed totally from herſelfe, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt
be ſayd to haue departed totally from her, which yet you deny; and therfore
muſt affirme, that ſinfull errours not Fundamentall, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy not the
Church, nor exclude hope of ſalvation. If therfore Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants will not
deſtroy their owne aſſertions, v.g. That they left not the Church, but
her corruptions; that they departed no farther from her, than ſhe departed
from herſelfe; that they left not the Church, but her externall Communion;
that Proteſtants agree in ſubſtance of Faith, becauſe they agree in
Fundamentall Points; that their Church is the ſame with the Roman; that the
Church may erre in Points not Fundamentall, but not in Fundamentalls; if, I
ſay, Proteſtants will <pb n="479" facs="tcp:59214:249"/>overthrow theſe, and other
like aſſertions, they muſt grant, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full errours in Points not
Fundamentall, deſtroy not the ſubſtance of Faith, nor exclude
ſalvation, and conſequently that they left the Church for Points not
neceſſary; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo are guilty of Schiſme, which you grant to happen of
when the cauſe of ſeparation is not neceſſary, as we haue ſeene out
your owne words, (Pag: 272. N. 53.)</p>
               <p n="39">39. But yet let vs ſee, whether Proteſtants do not
confeſſe, that ſinfull errours not fundamentall are compatible with
ſalvation, as we haue proved it to follow out of their deeds and principles.
You ſay (Pag 307. N. 106.) <hi>That it is lawfull to ſeparate from any
Churches communion, for errours not appertaining to the ſubstance of Faith,
is not vniverſally true, but with this exception, vnless that Church require
the beliefe and profesſion of them.</hi> And (Pag: 281. N. 67.) <hi>We ſay
not, that the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of any Church is to be forſaken for errours
vnfundamentall, vnless it exact withall either a diſſimulatiom of them
being noxious; or a profession of them against the dictate of conſcience, if
they be meere errours.</hi> And (N. 68.) <hi>Neither for ſin, nor errours,
ought a Church to be forſaken if ſhe does not impoſe and enjoyne
them.</hi> Therfore, ſay I, we muſt immedintly inferr, that errours not
Fundamentall, do not deſtroy Faith, Church, ſalvation. For if they did,
ipſo facto the Church which holds them, ſhould ceaſe to be a Churche, and
ſo ſhe muſt neceſſarily leaue all Churches, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all Churches muſt
leaue her, ſhee looſing her owne being, as a dead man leaves all, and is
left by all. And here let me put you in mynd, that while (Pag: 307. N. 106.)
aboue cited, you ſeeme to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe ſome great ſecret or ſubtilty, in
ſaying, <hi>that it is not lawfull to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from any Churches communion
for errours not appertaining to the ſubstance of Faith, is not vniverſally
true, but with this exception, vnless that Church requires the beliefe and
profession of them;</hi> you do but, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict yourſelfe. For if the Church
erre in the ſubſtance of Faith, or but does not impoſe the belief of
them, why are you (in your grounds) more obliged to forſake her, than a
Church that, erres in not Fundamentalls, and does not impoſe the belief of
them? Eſpecially if we call to mynd your doctrine, that one may erre
ſinfully againſt ſome Article of Faith, and yet retaine true belief in
order to other Points in which why may you not communicate with ſuch a Church
(Alſo Pag: 209. N. 38.) you ſay: <hi>You must giue me leaue to esteeme it a
high degree of preſumption, to enioyne men to beleeue, that there are, or can
be any other Fundamentall Articles of the Goſpell of Christ, than what
himſelfe commanded his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles <pb n="480" facs="tcp:59214:249"/>to teach all men; or
any damnable Hereſyes, but ſuch as are plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to theſe prime
Verityes.</hi> Therfore we muſt inferr, that ſeing er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in Points not
Fundamentall, are not repugnant to thoſe prime ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rityes, they cannot, in
your way, be eſteemed damnable Hereſyes; and if not damnable Hereſyes,
they cannot be damnable at all; ſince we ſuppoſe their malice to
conſiſt only in oppoſition to Divine Revelation; which is a damnable
ſin of Hereſy. Potter (Pag. 39.) ſaith, <hi>Among wiſe men each
diſcord in Religion diſſolves not the vnity of Faith.</hi> And (P. 40.)
<hi>Vnity in theſe matters</hi> (Secondary Points of Religion) <hi>is very
contingent and variable in the Church, now greater, now leſſer, never
abſolute in all particles of truth.</hi> From whence we muſt inferr, that
errours not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall exclude not ſalvation, nor can yield ſufficient
cauſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake a Church, or els that men muſt ſtill be forſaking
all Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is never <hi>abſolute vnity in all particles
of truth.</hi> Whitaker alſo (Controver: 2. Queſt: 5. Cap. 18.) ſaith;
<hi>If an Heretike muſt be excluded from ſalvation, that is, becauſe he
overthroweth ſome foundation. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he ſhake or overthrow ſome
foundation, he may be ſaved.</hi> According to which Doctrine, the greateſt
part of Scripture may be denyed. But for my purpoſe, it is ſufficient to
obſerve, that ſo learned a Proteſtant teaches, that errours in Points not
Fundamentall, exclude not from ſalvation. Morton in his impoſture (Cap:
15.) ſaith: <hi>Neither do Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants yeild more ſafty to any of the
Members of the Church of Rome in ſuch a caſe, then they doe to whatſoever
Heretiks, whoſe beliefe doth not vndermine the fundamentall Doctrine of
Faith.</hi> Therfore he grants ſome ſafety even to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks, if they
oppoſe not Fundamentall Articles; and yet they muſt be ſuppoſed to be
in ſinfull errour againſt ſome revealed truth; otherwiſe they could not
be Heretiks. Dr. Lawd (Pag: 355.) teaches, That to erre <hi>in things not
abſolutly neceſſary to ſalvation, is no breach vpon the one ſaving
Faith which is neceſſary.</hi> And (Pag: 360.) <hi>in things not
neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (though they be Divine Truths alſo) men may differ, and yet
preſerue the one neceſſary Faith.</hi> And (Pag: 299.) he ſaith; <hi>I
do indeed for my part acknowledge a poſſibility of ſalvation in the Roman
Church; but ſo, as that which I gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Romaniſts, is, not as they are
Romaniſts, but as they are Chriſtians, that is, as they belieue the Creed,
and hold the foundation, Chriſt himſelfe, not as they aſſociate
themſelves wittingly and knowingly to the groſſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions of
the Roman Church?</hi> Behold a cleare confeſſion, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
errours of the Roman Church do not exclude ſalvation, and yet they are
ſuppoſed to be againſt ſome revealed Truths! Therfore 
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:59214:250"/>errours in Points not Fundamentall, are not repugnant to
ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="40">40. But what concluſion can we deduce from theſe
Premiſes, that errours in Points not neceſſary or Fundamentall, are not
damnable, but that one may be ſaved in them. Dr. Lawd hath done it for vs
(Pag: 133.) in theſe words: <hi>The whole Church cannot vniverſally erre in
abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute Fundamentall Doctrines, and therfore there can be no juſt cauſe
to make a Schiſme from the whole Church.</hi> And (Pag: 196.) he teaches,
that by the manifeſt places in Scripture there may be ſetled <hi>Vnity and
Certainty of Beliefe in Neceſſaryes to Salvation; and in Non
neceſſarijs, in and about things not neceſſary there ought not to be a
Contention to a Separation.</hi> And (Pag: 129.) That <hi>the whole Church
cannot vniverſally erre in the Doctrine of Faith, is moſt true, (ſo you
will but vnderstand its not erring, in Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. Fundamentall Doctrines.)
And therfore tis true alſo, that there can be no just Cauſe to make a
Schiſme from the whole Church.</hi> Certainly Luther did not follow this
adviſe, who began, and maintayned, <hi>a Contention to Separation</hi> from
the whole World, from which, Dr. Lawd expreſſly ſaith there can be <hi>no
juſt Cauſe to make a Schiſme.</hi> But this is not all. For, (Pag: 226.)
he ſayth: <hi>Suppoſe a Generall Councell actually Erring in ſome Point
of Divine truth, I hope it will not follow that this Errour muſt be ſo
gross, as that forthwith it muſt needs be knowne to private men. And
doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less till they know it, Obedience muſt be yielded: Nay when they know
it, (if the Errour be not manifeſtly againſt Fundamentall Verity in which
caſe a Generall Councell cannot eaſily erre) I would haue all wiſe men
conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther externall Obedience be not even then to be yeelded. For if
Controverſyes ariſe in the Church, ſome end they muſt haue, or theyil
teare all in ſunder. And I am ſure no wiſdom can think that fit. Why
then, ſay a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell Erre, and a Erring Decree be ipſo jure, by
the very Law itſelf invalid, I would haue it wiſely conſidered againe,
whether it be not fit to allow a Generall Councell that Honour and Priviledge,
which all other Great Courts haue. Namely, that there be a Declaration of the
invalidity of its Decrees, as well as of the Lawes of other Courts, before
priuate men take Liberty to refuſe Obedience. For till ſuch a Declaration,
if the Councell ſtand not in force. A. C. Sets vp private Spirits to controll
Generall Councells; which is the thing he ſo much cryes out againſt in the
Proteſtants. Therfore it may ſeeme very fit and neceſſary for the Peace
of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that a Generall Councell thus erring, ſhould ſtand in
force, till Evidence of Scripture, or a Demonſtration make the Errour to
appeare, as that another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of equall Authority, reverſe it. For, as
for Morall Certainty, thats not ſtrong enough in Points of Faith.</hi> How
many Points do theſe words <pb n="482" facs="tcp:59214:250"/>containe in favour of
Catholikes, againſt Proteſtants?</p>
               <p n="41">41. 1. That knowne Errours in Points not Fundamentall,
are not only to be tolerated, but that Obedience is to be yeelded to the
Church, or Councell, even concerning ſuch Points and Errours. How then can
Luther be excuſed from Schiſme, who was ſo farr from yielding Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Church, that he oppoſed himſelfe to, and made a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike Separation
from all Churches? And how can Proteſtants be now excuſed from Schiſme,
who follow his example, defend his doctrine, and perſiſt in the Separation,
and breach which he made?</p>
               <p n="42">42. Secondly: That to profess externally errours in
Points not Fundamentall, excludes not ſalvation. For, to do any thing
repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to ſalvation, <hi>I am ſure no wiſdom can thinke fit, to</hi>
vſe his owne Words: And then it cannot be neceſſary to forſake the
Church, for avoyding the profeſſion of Errours not Fundamentall; and yet
this is the reaſon for which Proteſtants pretend to be excuſed from
Schiſme.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Thirdly; He doth not only affirme, but endeavours to
proue, that externall Obedience muſt be yielded to the Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
becauſe <hi>if Controverſyes ariſe in the Church, ſome end they muſt
haue, or theyil teare all in ſunder: Which</hi> he ſayth <hi>no wiſdom
can thinke fit.</hi> Which proues very well, that ſome Living Judge of
Controverſyes is neceſſary; and is directly oppoſite to
<hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> who affirmes, that there is no neceſſity of ſuch
a Judg, becauſe it is not neceſſary that all Controverſyes be ended.
But then,</p>
               <p n="44">44. Fourthly: It followeth evidently, in true Divinity;
that, if ſuch a Judge be neceſſary, He muſt be infallible in all things
belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to Faith and Religion. For, ſeing to diſſemble in matters of
Faith, or profess one thing, and belieue the contrary, is a grievous ſin, and
a moſt pernicious ly; no man can yield externall Obedience againſt the
judgment and dictamen of his Conſcience; and yet it being alſo true, that
we are obliged to obey the Decrees of Generall Councells, we muſt of
neceſſity affirme, that they are infallible, and cannot Decree any Errour
in Faith: Otherwiſe, I muſt either diſobey, or ſpeake againſt my
Conſcience in matters of Faith, which is intrinſecè malum, and can
never be excuſed from a damnable ſin. To theſe ſtraights Proteſtants
are brought, by denying the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Gods Church. May Councells be
diſobeyed? Then there will be no <pb n="483" facs="tcp:59214:251"/>meanes to end
Controverſyes, <hi>and theyil teare all in ſunder?</hi> Muſt they be
obeyed? Then in caſe they decree an Errour againſt Faith, as they may doe
if they be fallible, men muſt proceed againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. What
then remaynes, but to belieue that they are infallible? and ſo we ſecurely
may, and neceſſarily muſt, obey their Decrees, becauſe I am ſure that
they haue both infallibility not to erre, and Authority to command. Thus our
beliefe and proceeding is cleare, ſmooth, and moſt conſequent; wheras our
Adverſaryes denying the ſaid infallibility, are forced to great impietyes
againſt God, and manifeſt contradictions with themſelves. Beſides
ſeing he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, that <hi>Morall Certainty is not ſtrong enough in
Points of Faith,</hi> the Judge of Controverſyes in ſuch Points, muſt be
abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; otherwiſe we cannot receiue from him
<hi>Certaintyes ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi> for <hi>Points of Faith.</hi> And if
Controverſyes muſt be ended by Generall Councells, as he affirmes, their
Decrees muſt be of more than Morall Certainty.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Fiftly; Wheras he ſayes, that Obedience is not to
be yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if <hi>the Errour be manifeſtly againſt Fundamentall
Verity,</hi> he ought to conſider, that the chiefeſt malice in Hereſy,
conſiſts not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt ſuch or ſuch a materiall Object, or
Truth; great; or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; Fundamentall, or not Fundamentall; but in the
oppoſition it carryeth with the Divine teſtimony, which we ſuppoſe to
be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented in both kinds of Points, Fundamentall, and not
Fundamentall: And therfore he muſt either ſay, that Obedience is to be
yielded in both, (which were moſt abſurd) or in neither: And, that it may
be ſecurely yielded in both, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg a Judge endued with
infallibility. Neither doth A. C. <hi>Set vp private Spirits to controll
Generall Councells,</hi> which Catholiks belieue to be infallible; but that
abſurdity flowes out of the doctrine of Proteſtants, affirming them to be
fallible, even in Fundamentall Points, and conſequently private men are
neither obliged, nor can rely on their Authority in matters of Faith, for
which, <hi>Morall Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is not ſtrongh enough,</hi> but may Judge as
they find cauſe out of Scripture, or reaſon, and may oppoſe their
Decrees, nor can ever obey them againſt their Conſcience. And if all
Councells be fallible, what greater certainty can I receaue from the ſecond,
than from the firſt, if we meerly reſpect their Authority. For, if I be
mooved with ſome new reaſon or Demonſtration, I am not mooved 
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:59214:251"/>for the Authority of the Councell, but for that Reaſon
which ſeemes good to mee. And is not this to ſet vp private men and Spirits
to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll Generall Councells?</p>
               <p n="46">46. Sixthly: He ſaith, <hi>A Generall Councell cannot
eaſily erre manifeſtly</hi> againſt Fundamentall Verity: From whence I
inferr, that ſeing Luther oppoſed the whole Church, and ſo many Generall
Councells, held before his tyme; he is to be preſumed, to haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
them, not for any manifeſt Fundamentall, but at moſt for Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours not
Fundamentall; (to ſpeake as Proteſtants do: For indeed Councells cannot
erre in either kind) in which Points not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, he ſayth men are to
yield Obedience, and therfore He, and all thoſe who formerly did, and now do,
follow his example, are to be judged guilty of Schiſme.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Seaventhly; He ſaith, <hi>It may ſeeme very fit
and neceſſary for the Peace of Chriſtendome, that a Generall Councell
thus erring, ſhould ſtand in force till evidence of Scripture, or a
Demonſtration make the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to appeare, as that another Councell of equall
Authority reverſe it.</hi> In theſe words he gives vs Catholikes no ſmall
advantage againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall principle of Proteſtants; that, Scripture
alone containes evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all neceſſary Points. For if evidence of
Scripture, or a Demonſtration may be ſo inevident, or obſcure to a whole
lawfull Generall Councell, that it may fall into Fundamentall Errours, which,
in the grounds of Proteſtants, are oppoſite only to ſome Truth evidently
contained in Scripture, it is evident that he and other Proteſtants ſay
nothing, when they talke of evidence of Scripture, but that indeed every one
makes and calls that evident, which he deſires ſhould be ſo: And how is
it poſſible that a true Generall Councell ſhould be ſo blind, as not to
ſee that which is evident? And this indeed is to ſet vp private Spirits to
controll Generall Councells. I will not vrge, what he meanes by a
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, when he diſtinguiſheth it from Evidence of Scripture. A
Demonſtration implyes an vndeniable, and as I may ſay, an Evident Evidence;
and if it be an Evidence diſtinct from the Evidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which
according to Proteſtants containes evidently all neceſſary Points of
Faith, it muſt be evidence of naturall Reaſon, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men:
And how can a Generall Councell erre againſt ſuch a kind of Evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? But
as I ſayd, Evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts is a voluntary word, which they make
vſe of to their purpoſe. Beſides, Scripture is no leſſe evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in
innumerable points not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall, than it is in ſome which are 
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:59214:252"/>Fundamentall: and therfore, all who belieue Scripture,
are obliged to belieue thoſe no less than theſe, vnless men will ſay that
it is not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to belieue, and profeſſe ſomthing evidently knowne
to be againſt Scripture; and therfore in this, there can be no diſtinction
between Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall Points; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo a Generall Councell
may as eaſily erre againſt Fundamentall Articles, as againſt Points not
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall clearly delivered in Scripture; in which caſe, it is
deſtructiue of ſalvation to erre againſt either of thoſe kinds. I haue
beene ſomwhat long in pondering his words, becauſe I vnderſtand the booke
is eſteemed by ſome; and I hope it appeares, by what I haue now ſaid out
of it; that we may be ſaved; that a Living judg of controverſyes is
neceſſary; that, Luther, and all Proteſtants are guilty of the ſin of
Schiſme. Three as mayne and capitall Points in fauour of vs, againſt
Proteſtants, as we can deſire, and they feare!</p>
               <p n="48">48. Herafter we will ponder <hi>Mr. Chillingworths</hi>
words for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe; who ſpeaking of Generall Councells,
ſaith (Pag: 200. N. 18.) <hi>I willingly confess, the judgment of a Councell,
though not infallible, is yet ſo farr directiue, and obliging, that without
apparent reaſon to the contrary, it may be ſin to reject it, at least, not
to affoard it an outward ſubmisſion for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like peace-ſake.</hi> As
alſo we will conſider Potters words: (Pag: 165.) ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus: <hi>We
ſay, that ſuch Generall Councells as are lawfully called, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
orderly are great and awfull repreſentations of the Church Catholique; that
they are the highest externall Tribunall which the Church hath on Earth; that
their Authority is immediatly derived and delegated from Christ; that no
Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian is exempted from their cenſures and jurisdiction; that their
decrees bind all perſons to externall obedience, and may not be questioned
but vpon evident reaſon, nor reverſed but by an equall authority: that if
they be carefull and diligent in the vſe of all good Meanes for finding out
the truth, it is very probable that the good ſpirit will ſo direct them,
that they ſhall not erre, at least, not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="49">49. But let vs proceed in proving, that Proteſtants
hold Points not Fundamentall, not to be of any great moment, and much less to
be deſtructiue of ſalvation. It is cleare, that Proteſtants differ among
them ſelves in many Points, which they prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be only not Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſay they do not deſtroy the ubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Faith, nor hinder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from
being Brethren, and of the ſame Church. And why? becauſe ſuch Points are
ſmall matter, as Whitaker ſpeakes (Cont:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Queſt: 4. Cap: 3.)
<hi>Things in different and tittles,</hi> as King James ſaith in his
<hi>Monitory Epistle: Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <pb n="486" facs="tcp:59214:252"/>of no great moment,</hi>
as Andrewes (Reſpons: ad Apolog: Bellarmin: Cap: 14.) No great matters,
<hi>Apology of the Church of England. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of nothing,</hi> as Calvin calls
them Admonit: Vlt: (Pag: 132.) <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not to be much reſpected if</hi>
you believe Martyr (in locis, Claſſe 4. C. 10. §. 65.) <hi>Formes and
phraſes of ſpeech,</hi> as Potter ſpeaks, (Pag: 90.) a <hi>curious
nicity</hi> (Pag: 91.)</p>
               <p n="50">50. Out of all which, we muſt conclude both out of the
words, deeds, and principles of Proteſtants: Firſt that errours againſt
Points not Fundamentall are not deſtructiue of ſalvation, being but matters
of ſmall conſideration in their account. Secondly; That they can not be
excuſed from Schiſme, who forſooke all Churches for Points not
Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, and of ſo ſmall moment, in which they diſagree amongſt
themſelves, and in diverſe of which, many of them agree with vs, againſt
their pretended Brethren; which is to be well obſerved. Thirdly, that,
<hi>Chillingw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> had no
reaſon (Pag: 11) to ſay to <hi>Charity Maintayned; produce any one
Protestant that ever did ſo</hi> (that is, affirme that every errour not
Fundamentall is not deſtructiue of ſalvation) <hi>and I will giue you leaue
to ſay, It is the only thing in Question;</hi> ſeing I haue proved out of
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chiefe Proteſtants, that, for which he ſayth no one can be produced;
yea and I can yet produce a full confeſſion of <hi>Mr. Chillingworth</hi>
himſelf, that, Errours in not Fundamentalls, are not <hi>deſtructiue of
ſalvation,</hi> nor ſuch as may <hi>neceſſitate or warrant any man to
diſturbe the peace, or renounce the Communion</hi> of a Church. Thus he
ſpeakes in his Anſwer to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, (N. 39.) <hi>Though I hold not the
Doctrine of all Proteſtants abſolutely true, (which with reaſon cannot be
required of me, while they hold contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions) yet I hold it free from all
impiety, and from all Errour deſtructiue of ſalvation, or in itſelfe
damnable. For the Church of England, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the conſtant
Doctrine of it is ſo pure and Orthodox, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believes it, and
lives according to it, vndoubtedly he ſhall be ſaved, and that there is no
errour in it, which may neceſſitate or warrant any man to diſturbe the
peace, or renounce the communion of it.</hi> Here I obſerue; firſt; If the
doctrine of Proteſtanss (whom he expreſſly confeſſes to hold
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, and conſequently ſome of them to hold errours at leaſt
in Points not Fundamentall) be free from all errour deſtructue of
ſalvation, or in itſelfe damnable; it followes, that errours againſt
Points not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, are not deſtructiue of ſalvation, nor in
themſelves damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is the thing I intended to proue. 2. What he
ſaith of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours among Proteſtants, that they are not deſtructiue of
ſalvation, he <pb n="487" facs="tcp:59214:253"/>muſt alſo ſay of our pretended
errours: both becauſe commonly, of diſagreeing Proteſtants one part
agrees with vs, as alſo becauſe, as I ſayd, diverſe of them ſtand
directly with vs, againſt the common courſe of the reſt; and finally,
becauſe the reaſon of being, or not being damnable, is common to all Points
not Fundamentall, which are ſuppoſed to contradict ſome divine revelation
ſufficiently propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; which to doe, if it be deſtructiue of
ſalvation, muſt be ſo for all ſuch Points; if not; in none at all. 3.
<hi>If the conſtant doctrine of the Church of England be ſo pure, that
whoſoever believes it and lives accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, vndoubtedly he ſhall be
ſaved; and that there is no errour in it, which may necessitate or warrant
any man to diſturbe the peace, or renounce the communion of it,</hi> you
muſt ſay; ſeing Luther and his followers did, and do, diſturbe the
peace, and renounce, the communion of the whole Church of God before his tyme,
which muſt be ſuppoſed to haue erred only in Points not Fundamentall,
(otherwiſe it had beene no Church) they did, and do, that, for which there
was no neceſſity, and for which they had no warrant, and therfore cannot
avoide the juſt imputation of Schiſme. For the ſame reaſon alſo (that
the Church erred only in points not Fundamentall) you muſt grant, that
whoſoever believes as the Church did, and lives accordingly, vndoubtedly
ſhall be ſaved. For I am ſure you belieue the Church of England to haue
erred in diverſe Points, and in particular in her 39. Articles, which was her
conſtant doctrine, if ſhe had any conſtant at all. In particular, your
conſcience tells you, that you belieue not the Myſtery of the Bleſſed
Trinity, and much less, that our Saviour Chriſt was true God, and
conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall with his Father: to ſay nothing of other Points, of
thoſe 39. arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And is it not ridiculous, to heare you talke of purity
of doctrine of the Church of England, which you belieue to be ſtayned with
ſuch Errours? But you wrote for Ends! If then ſalvation may be ſo
aſſured in the Church of England, you muſt grant the ſame of that
Church which Luther and his aſſociates forſooke, and that therfore they
certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude themſelves from ſalvation by forſaking the communion
of them, amongſt whom ſalvation was ſo certaine: and remember your words
(Pag: 272. N. 53.) <hi>it concernes every man who ſeparates from any Churches
communion even as much as his ſalvation is worth, to looke moſt carefully
to it, that the cauſe of his ſeparation be juſt and neceſſary. For
vnless it be neceſſary it can very hardly be ſufficient.</hi> To which
propoſition, if we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; but it cannot be neceſſary to
ſeparate, for avoyding that errour, <pb n="488" facs="tcp:59214:253"/>or attaining that
Truth, which to avoyde, or attaine, is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation;
therfore Luther who ſeparated from the Church for Points not neceſſary,
cannot pretend any neceſſary or ſufficient cauſe for ſuch his
ſeparation, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly was guilty of the ſin of Schiſme. 4. But
yet you will ſtill be making good, that in theſe matters, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
and yourſelf in particular, haue no conſtancy, but ſay and vnſay, as
may beſt ſerue their turne. You tell vs; the doctrine of all Proteſtants
is <hi>free from all Errour in it ſelfe damnable;</hi> which agrees not with
what you ſay of Proteſtants (Pag: 19.) <hi>If we faile in vſing ſuch a
meaſure of induſtry in finding truth as humane prudence, and ordinary
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> ſhall adviſe, in a matter of ſuch <hi>conſequence,
our Errours begin to be malignant, and juſtly imputable, as offenſes
againſt God, and that loue of his truth which he requires in vt.</hi> And
(Pag: 306. N. 106.) <hi>For our continuing in the Communion</hi> (of
Proteſtants) <hi>notwithſtanding their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, the juſtification
hereof, is not ſo much, that their Errours are not damnable, as that they
require not the belief and profeſſion of theſe Errours among the
conditions of their Communion.</hi> And (Pag: 279. N. 64.) <hi>The viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church is free indeed from all Errours abſolutely deſtructive, and
vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but not from all errour which in itſelfe is damnable; not from
all which will actually bring damnation vpon them that keepe themſelves in
them, by their owne voluntary and avoidable fault.</hi> If the viſible Church
be not free from <hi>errour which in itſelfe is damnable,</hi> how could you
ſay that <hi>the Proteſtant Church of England is free from all errour
damnable in itſelfe?</hi> But why do I cite particular paſſages? You giue
a generall Rule concerning all Errours, (Pag: 158. N. 52.) in theſe words:
<hi>If the cauſe of it</hi> (an errour) <hi>be ſome voluntary and avoidable
fault the Errour is it ſelfe ſinfull, and conſequently in its owne nature
damnable; as if by negligence in ſeeking the Truth, by vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes to find
it, by pride, by obstinacy, by deſiring that Religion ſhoudl be true which
ſutes best with my ends, by feare of mens
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll opinion, or any other
world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feare, or any other worldly hope, I betray my ſelfe to any errour
contrary to any Divine revealed truth, that errour may be justly stiled a
ſin, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of it ſelf to ſuch a one damnable. And if he dy
without Contrition, this errour in it ſelfe damnable, will be likewiſe ſo
vnto him.</hi> I haue ſet downe your words at large, that Proteſtants may
learne by them, how to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their conſcience, about what care they vſe,
to find the true Church a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Religion, which imports them no less, then the
eternall ſalvation, or Damnation of their ſoules: And that every one may
clearly ſee, that you do not only grant more than once, the errours of
Proteſtants to be in <pb n="489" facs="tcp:59214:254"/>themſelves damnable, but alſo
a reaſon for it; namely, becauſe all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in Faith are contrary to
ſome Divine Revelation; which reaſon is common to Proteſtants, to the
Church of England, and to all who erre in matters of Faith. And then with what
ſincerity could you affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that whoſoever holds the doctrine of the
Church of England, and lives according to it, vndoubtedly he ſhall be
ſaved? Can one who is in an errour damnable of itſelfe, be vndoubtedly
ſaved, without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Haue we not heard you ſay; To him who dyed
without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, the errour in itſelfe damnable, will be likewiſe ſo
vnto him? Do you not ſay (Pag: 138. N. 23.) <hi>For ought I know, all
Proteſtants, and all that haue ſenſe, muſt grant that all errours are
alike damnable, if the manner of propounding the contrary Truths be not
different?</hi> Therfore you muſt grant, that as errours againſt
Fundamentall Truths ſufficiently propounded, are damnable; ſo alſo
errours againſt not Fundamentall Truths, are damnable, if both be equally
propoſed. How then are the Errours of all Proteſtants, and of the Church of
England in particular, not damnable?</p>
               <p n="51">51. Thus we haue ſufficiently confuted your firſt
Memorandum; and ſhewed, that the ſeparation of Proteſtants was
cauſeless, both in reality, and ad hominem, or according to the principles,
and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Proteſtants themſelves. In reality; becauſe there
can never be juſt reaſon to ſeparate from the Church of God (which
therfore muſt be infallible, and free from all corruptions and errours.) Ad
hominem; becauſe according to the principles of Proteſtants, errours not
Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, being not deſtructiue of ſalvation, cannot yield
ſufficient cauſe of ſeparation, nor free any from yielding obedience,
even in the ſuppoſed vnfundamentall errours, as they confess ours to be;
and if ſomtyme Proteſtants ſay the contrary, at other tymes they
contradict themſelves; which ſerves only for their greater condemnation, in
lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the communion of all Chriſtian Churches, vpon vncertaintyes in which
themſelves do waver, ſomtyme affirming, ſomtyme denying. And vpon this
very ground of vncertainty, I go forward to proue more, and more, that their
ſeparation was cauſleſſe.</p>
               <p n="52">52. For, (Pag: 308. N. 108.) you do not diſallow the
ſaying of <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> (Part: 1. Pag: 207.) <hi>In caſes of
vncertainty, we are not to leave our Superiour, nor caſt of his obedience,
nor publikly oppoſe his decrees.</hi> And Hooker cited by you in your (Pag:
310. 311. N. 110.) teaches two things to our preſent purpoſe. The one: That
an Argument neceſſary <pb n="490" facs="tcp:59214:254"/>and demonſtratiue is ſuch,
as being propoſed to any man, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the mynd cannot chuſe but
inwardly aſſent. The other; that in caſe of probability only, or
vncertainty, Lawes eſtabliſhed, are to be obeyed, and men are bound (not to
obſerue thoſe Lawes which they are perſwaded to be againſt the law of
God, but) for the tyme to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend their perſwaſions to the contrary,
and that in otherwiſe doing, they offend againſt God by troubling the
Church. This ground being layd, I ſubſume; (beſides what hath now been
ſayd of the variouſness a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vncertainty of Proteſtants about Points not
Fundamentall) Proteſtants cannot poſſibly haue evidence or certainty
againſt Catholiks, therfore they offended againſt God by dividing
theſelves from vs, and troubling the peace of all Churches. The
ſubſumption, or Minor I proue diverſe wayes (abſtaining from
examination of particular Controverſyes) and:</p>
               <p n="53">53. Firſt in this manner; <hi>An Argument neceſſary
and Demonſtratiue is ſuch, as being propoſed to any man, and
vnderſtood, the mynd cannot chuſe but inwardly aſſent,</hi> ſaith
Hooker. If therfore the arguments of Proteſtants againſt vs were
neceſſary and demonſtratiue, learned Catholiks could not chuſe but
inwardly aſſent; and vnless they were extreme wicked diſſemblers
againſt their conſcience, would alſo publikly profeſſe. And yet we
ſee, that all Catholiks, in all Ages, and places, learned, holy, wiſe, and
ſuch as God vſed for inſtruments, in working many great and evident
Miracles, and in converting nations to the Faith of Chriſt, all theſe, I
ſay, did, and do, and ever will, diſſent from the Arguments and
concluſions of Proteſtants: therfore it is cleare, that their reaſons
againſt vs, are not neceſſary nor demonſtratiue, and ſo according to
Hooker, the <hi>Lawes eſtabliſhed were to be obeyed</hi> and Proteſtants
were <hi>bound to ſuſpend their perſwaſions to the contrary.</hi>
Truly, this is an Argument which muſt convince any man, of a mynd not
perverſe, and reſolved to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his errour.</p>
               <p n="54">54. Secondly I prove that they cannot produce againſt
vs any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or demonſtratiue Argument; in regard of the Antiquity
of our doctrine confeſſed even by our Adverſaryes, as may be ſeene in
Brier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley (P. 129. &amp; ſeqq. Edition: Ann. 1608.) now how could theſe
doctrines haue paſſed the ſearch and examine of ſo many learned men,
and watchfull Prelats, for the ſpace of ſo many ages, if any neceſſary
or demonſtratiue argument, to which men cannot but aſſent, could haue
been produced againſt them?</p>
               <p n="55">55. Thirdly; Learned Proteſtants confess, that the
Fathers hold <pb n="491" facs="tcp:59214:255"/>with vs, againſt them, in many and
chiefeſt Points of Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted in theſe dayes, as we haue
ſeene hertofore: which could not happen, if the Arguments of Proteſtants
againſt the Fathers and vs, were neceſſary and demonſtratiue.</p>
               <p n="56">56. Fourthly; In all our chiefeſt differences,
diverſe moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants, agree with vs, againſt their
pretended Brethren, as we haue alſo demonſtrated hertofore. Now theſe
men, being learned could not but ſee and aſſent to neceſſary and
demonſtratiue Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if any could haue been alledged againſt vs; and
being Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaryes, would not haue fayld to make vſe of them; nor would
they haue ever left their Brethren, and joyned with vs, if evidence of truth,
and reaſon had not forced them therto; or if they could haue eſpyed any
even probability, in the grounds and Doctrines of their Brethren: wherby it
appeares, that the tenets of Proteſtants are ſo farr from being evident or
their Arguments neceſſary and demonſtrative, that they are not ſo much
as probable. Who, I pray, will belieue, that you could haue any neceſſary
demonſtratiue Arguments for your ſo many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Religion, and for your
ending in Socinianiſme, which you never durſt openly profess, and yet men
are not wont to be aſhamed of truths, proved by neceſſary, and
demonſtratiue Reaſons? One demonſtration or evidence cannot be contrary
to another, and yet no doubt but you pretended evidence for all your
alterations to contrary opinions; which ſtill makes it more and more evident,
that with Sectaryes, evidence affects rather their will, or fancy, than their
vnderſtanding. And here you ought in all reaſon to apply to the Ancient
Fathers, and learned Proteſtants agreeing with vs, againſt their Brethren,
what you ſay, (Pag: 40. and 41. N. 13.) in favour of Proteſtants in
generall to proue, that there is no <hi>necesſity of damning all thoſe that
are of contrary beliefe;</hi> in theſe words; <hi>The contrary belief may be
about the ſenſe of ſome place of Scripture which is ambiguous, and with
probability capable of diuerſe ſenſes: and in ſuch caſes it is no
mervaile, and ſure no ſin, if ſeuerall men go ſeuerall wayes. Alſo,
the contrary beliefe may be concerning Points wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Scripture may with ſo
great probability be alledged on both ſides, (which is a ſure note of a
Point not neceſſary) that men of honeſt and vpright hearts, true louers
of God and of truth, ſuch as deſire aboue all things, to know Gods will and
to do it, may without any fault at all, ſome goe one way, and ſome
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſome (and thoſe as good men as either of the former)
ſuſpend their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Now whatſoever you judge of vs, yet I hope
you will not deny, <pb n="492" facs="tcp:59214:255"/>the Ancient Fathers, and your owne
Proteſtant Brethren, to be ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifyed as you deſcribe, <hi>men of
honeſt and vpright hearts, true lovers of God and the truth</hi> &amp;c: And
therfore ſeing they vnderſtood the word of God as we doe, you ought to
abſolue them, yea and vs, and conceiue that Luther had no neceſſary
cauſe to forſake the whole Church, for Points maintayned by men of ſo
great quality in all kinds, whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority you cannot deny to be
ſufficient for making a doctrine proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and for deveſting the contrary
of certainty: and therfore according to Hookers rule, they ought to haue
ſuſpended their perſwaſion, and they offended againſt God by
troubling the whole Church.</p>
               <p n="57">57. Neither can you object againſt the Fathers what you
ſay againſt vs (Pag: 280. N. 66.) that, <hi>what may be enough for men in
ignorance may be to knowing men not enough</hi> &amp;c: For, beſides that it,
is I know not whether more ridiculous or impious, to ſay the Fathers were men
in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and the whole Church in errour; at leaſt you will not deny,
but thoſe Proteſtants who agree with vs are knowing men, and haue all the
meanes of knowing the truth, which other Proteſtants haue, and they being
ſuppoſed (by you I hope) to be <hi>men of honest and vpright hearts, may
without any fault at all</hi> diſſent from their Brethren, according to
your owne rule. And ſince you muſt excuſe them, it were manifeſt
injuſtice to condemne vs, who defend the ſame doctrine with them.</p>
               <p n="58">58. Fifthly; It is a principle of nature that no private
perſon, much leſſe a Community, and leaſt of all the whole Chriſtian
world, ſhould be deprived of that good name, of which they were once in
peaoeable and certaine poſſeſſion, without very cleare, and convincing
evidence. Seing then, even Proteſtants grant, that for divers Ages, the
Church, and the Roman Church in particular, enjoyed the good Name, and Thing,
of being Orthodox, and Pure, ſhe cannot be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of them without
evidence; neither can probability or vncertainty, be ſufficient to forſake
her Communion, as noxious. O of how different a mynd are our Noveliſts, from
the Ancient Doctours of Gods Church, who againſt all Heretiks oppoſed the
Tradition and Succeſſion of the Biſhops of Rome! as Tertuilian, the SS.
Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus and Auſtine, as Calvin confeſſes (L. 4.
Inſtit. C. 3.) and thinkes to ſaue himſelfe, with this Anſwer, (Sect.
3.) Cum exrra contoverſiam eſſet &amp;c. <hi>Seing it was vndoubtedly
true, that nothing was altered in doctrine from the beginning till that Age,
they did alledg that which was ſufficient to overthrow all new errours,
namely, that they were repugnant to the Doctrine <pb n="493" facs="tcp:59214:256"/>which by
vnanimous conſent was conſtantly kept from the very tyme of the Apoſtles
themſelves.</hi> But this Anſwer, can ſerue, only to ſhew that the
Argument of the Fathers againſt Heretiks, was plainly of no force at all.
For, if the Tradition and ſucceſſion of Biſhops in the Church of Rome,
were not aſſured of the particular aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the holy Ghoſt, no
argument could be taken to proue any doctrine true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had been
taught in that Sea, in regard that without ſuch aſſis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Errour might
haue crept in, and tradition might haue delivered a falſhood. Therfore the
Fathers alledging the Doctrine of the Roman Church, for a Rule to all other,
muſt ſuppoſe ſuch an aſſiſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which their
adverſaryes might haue rejected the Tradition of that Sea, with as much
facility, as the Tradition, and Authority, of any other. And to ſay, the
Fathers grounded their Argument meerly vpon matter of fact (that de facto the
Church of Rome had delivered other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than thoſe Heretiks held) and
thence had inferred the falſhood of their Hereſyes, would haue beene
directly petitio principij, as if they had ſayd; The Church of Rome de facto
(without any certaine aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt) holds the contrary
of that which you He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks teach, but that which ſhe holds, is true;
therfore your Doctrine is falſe. For, this Minor (that which ſhe holds, is
true) had been a meere begging of the Queſtion, without any proofe at all,
and had been no more in effect, then if the Fathers had ſayd; The Doctrine of
the Roman Church, and our Doctrine which is the ſame with Hers, is true,
becauſe we ſuppoſe it to be true, and therfore yours is falſe. Wherfore
we muſt giue glory to God, and acknowledg that the Fathers believed that the
Roman Church was aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Churches, not
to fall into errour in matters of Faith and Religion. Howſoever, let vs take
what Calvin grants, that at leaſt the Church of Rome conſerved the Truth
and purity of Faith till the tyme of S. Auſtine, that is, between the fourth
and fift Age after our Saviour Chriſt; and Heretiks commonly grant, that the
Church of Rome was pure for the firſt fiue hundred yeares. Now let any man of
judgment conſider, whether it was probable, or poſſible, that immediatly
after ſo great purity, and Sanctity, ſo huge a deluge of ſuperſtitions,
Idolatryes, Hereſyes, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, could haue flowed into the Church of
Rome, within the ſpace of one hundred yeares, that is, till the tyme of S.
Gregory the Great, without being noted or ſpoken of, or contradicted by any
one: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <pb n="494" facs="tcp:59214:256"/>if we conſider, that other
doctrines, which both Proteſtants and Catholiks profess to be Hereſyes,
were inſtantly obſerved, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, and condemned: and to ſay, that
thoſe only of which they hold vs guilty, did paſſe without obſervation
of any, can be judged no better than a voluntary, affected, fooliſh fancy. I
beſeech the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Reader, for the Eternall good of his owne ſoule,
to pauſe here a little, and well ponder this Point. Beſides, S. Gregory
himſelfe, was a moſt holy, learned, and Zealous Paſtour; in ſo much
that in thoſe reſpects, his Feaſt is ſolemnly kept in the Grecian
Church, and all the Orthodox Biſhops of the whole World, never ceaſed to
hold their Communion with Him; his Predeceſſours; and Succeſſours;
which they neither would, nor could haue done, if they had diſcovered any
one, and much more, if ſo many, and ſo enormious Errours, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
had appeared in that Sea, which was not any private, obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and, as it
were, inviſible Church, but was ever viſible, and conſpicuous, and like a
beacon to all Nations: And therfore what ſhe taught and profeſſed, could
not be hidden vnder a buſhell, but being placed vpon a candleſticke, did
ſo ſhine to all, that all muſt needs ſee it, and either contradict,
which none did, or approue it, as they did. And here we may alledg the ſaying
of King James ad Peron: (Pag: 388.) <hi>Durſt one but lightly corrupt the
Faith approovea through the World? It was eaſy for a child to diſcover the
new Maiſter by his Novelty. And the beliefe of truth being found, all the
Pastours of the whole World, if need were, were mooved, and being moved did not
rest, till they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the ill, and provided for the ſecurity of the
ſheepe of Chriſt.</hi> How then is it poſſible, that, this heape of
pretended Errours, in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, could appeare without being
diſcovered, till Luther, an Apoſtata from his Faith, and Religious Order,
did ſacrilegiouſly marry a vowed Nunne, and in the middeſt of his
ſhamefull carnall ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſures, receaue revelations from the Divell, as
himſelfe doth openly confess? Wherfore we muſt conclude, that theſe
Points which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants would needs miſcall Errours, were indeed the
Orthodox Doctrines of the Ancient Fathers, and whole Church of all precedent
Ages: of the Poſſeſſion of which Truths, and good Name, we ought not to
be deprived, without moſt certaine evidence, which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any
Heretike ſo much as pretend to doe with any modeſty or ſhew of truth, as
I haue proved, and will ſaie more hereafter.</p>
               <p n="59">59. Sixthly; Proteſtants can proue nothing againſt
vs, with evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <pb n="495" facs="tcp:59214:257"/>but by Scripture alone; which is
impoſſible for them to do, as I haue ſhewed at large (Chap 2.) For,
ſeing words are capable of diverſe ſenſes, it is impoſſible, by the
words al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e, to convince
that they are vnderſtood in ſuch or ſuch a particular, determinate
ſenſe, and not in ſome other, of which they are capable; and what is
poſſible, for ought we know, doth actually happen; and Gods free Decrees in
this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of vſing words in ſome ſet meaning, are not evident, either
in themſelves, or are notifyed to vs by any certaine Rule: and therfore
Proteſtants cannot with any evidence, proue out of Scripture, that our
doctrine containes any Errour Fundamentall, or not Fundamentall. And it is well
to be conſidered, that the ſame Arguments, which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants object
againſt vs now, were obſerved and anſwered by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Divines, before
Proteſtants appeared to the world, as they anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red objections made
againſt Chriſtian Religion, or Catholike Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, by Pagans, Turks, Jewes
and ſuch Heretiks, as Proteſtants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; and it is therby apparent,
that they did not diſſemble difficultyes but did propoſe them with no
less candor and ſincerity, than they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them with truth, learning,
and ſolidity. They alone were the men, who oppoſed themſelves murum pro
Domo Dei, againſt all the enemyes of Chriſtianity, and the world believed,
that they gaue at that tyme as true ſolutions of thoſe very objections of
old Heretikes, which now happen to be made by Proteſtants, as they did to
thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultyes, which were vrged againſt Chriſtian Religion, or
againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Verityes, by old Heretiks, whom even Proteſtants
condemne, Wherfore, to come now, and tell the world, that the Anſwers of
thoſe Catholike Doctours, againſt ſome few Points, were not ſolid,
muſt needs breed a huge ſcandall, againſt Chriſtian Religion, and
Orthodox doctrine impugned by Pagans, Jewes, Turks, and old condemned Heretiks.
Certaine it is, that the enemyes of Chriſtian Religion, may object greater
difficultyes againſt Chriſtianity, than any Heretike can invent againſt
vs. It is therfore cleare, that Proteſtants can haue no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or
demonſtratiue Argument, to proue that the Church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into any
leaſt falſhood, in matters concerning Faith; and ſo we muſt conclude
with theſe words of Hooker (cited by <hi>Chilling:</hi> Pag: 311.) <hi>As for
the orders eſtabliſhed, ſith equity and reaſon favour that which is in
being, till orderly judgment of deciſion be given againſt it, it is but
justice to exact of you, and perverſnes in you it ſhould be to deny
thervnto your willing Obedience.</hi> Doth not every word of Hooker con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne 
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:59214:257"/>Luther and his followers: <hi>Sith equity and reaſon
favour that which is in being,</hi> and no <hi>orderly judgment of deciſion
had been given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the orders</hi> which they found eſtabliſhed in
all Churches; it was but juſtice to exact of them, and worſe then
perverſness in them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny therunto willing obedience, and a formall ſin
of Schiſme, by ſuch diſobedience to forſake the Communion of the whole
Church.</p>
               <p n="60">60. Seventhly; As the Roman Church, and all Churches of
Her Communion could not be deſpoyled of the Poſſeſſion they held of
being accounted true and pure Churches; ſo alſo the Pope, Biſhops, and
other Prelats, and Paſtours vnder Him, could not without Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, and
injuſtice be diſobeyed and deprived of the Right, which they did peaceably
poſſeſſe, when Luther firſt appeared. And for the Popes Primacy in
particular, it is acknowledged by Proteſtants to haue beene ancient, and
taught by Holy Fathers, even with in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of yeares which Proteſtants
admit for Orthodox; and by ſome chief Proteſtants is held as a thing
indifferent, yea and profitable. And I deſire the Reader for his
ſatiſfaction in this behalfe, to ſee Brierlyes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex Verbo Peters
Primacy, and Popes Primacy, and turne to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which there he ſhall
find cited See alſo <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Pag: 1. Cap: 3. N. 19.) of
this matter. If then this Point be maintayned by Ancient Fathers; if believed
and practiſed in thoſe incorrupt Ages; if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Proteſtants
for a thing profitable; who will ſo much as pretend any evidence of
Scripture, or neceſſary demonſtratiue reaſon againſt it? And
conſequently who will not inferr, that the ſeparation of Proteſtants from
the whole Church was cauſeless, and ſo according to your owne Memorandum,
ſinfull, and Schiſmaticall?</p>
               <p n="61">61. Let vs now come to examine your ſecond evaſion
(Pag: 265. N. 31.) <hi>The impoſing vpon men vnder paine of Excommunication a
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of profeſſing knowne Errours, and practiſing knowne
corruptions, is a ſufficient and neceſſary cauſe of ſeparation: And
that this is the cauſe which Proteſtants alledg to juſtify their
ſeparation from the Church of Rome.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="62">62. Firſt; It is manifeſt that Proteſtants departed
from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church voluntarily, before they were forced by
Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, or by any other meanes. For, they voluntarily profeſſed a
Faith contrary to that of the whole Church, which moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and even
ſollicitouſly endeavoured by all meanes poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them, as
appeares in the life of Luther; Cardinall Caietan being <pb n="497" facs="tcp:59214:258"/>ſent to Germany for that very purpoſe, a ſafe conduct being
aſſured to them. And for Communion in Sacraments, Liturgy, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Prelats; they did ſeparate from them, as well as from profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
the ſame Faith; one of their Errours being, that our worſhip of God being
corrupted, they could not communicate with vs in Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, publike prayers
&amp;c. Therfore they firſt did ſeparate themſelves: Fugitivi, non
fugati, the contrary wherof they are wont to affirme. And not only they
ceaſed to communicate with vs, nor were content to hold their peace, bearing
with patience the corruptions of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes (as they falſely ſtyled them)
but alſo drew men to conventicles of their owne, pretended to erect new
Churches, and ſet vp aultar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt aultar, and the like; and this
againſt the commands of Biſhops and Princes, both Eccleſiaſticall, and
Temporall. You profess hightly to eſteeme Hugo Grotius. If in this you
beleeue not me, beleeve him (in voto pro pace Eccleſiaſtica, Pa: 5.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Intelligebam, ſaith he, ex ſeniorum
relatu, &amp; ex perſcriptis Hiſtoriis, extitiſſe poſtea homines, qui
illa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in qua majores noſtri fuerant Eccleſiam deſerenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> omnino
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerent: neque tantum ipſi deſererent, nonnulli etiam priuſquam

Epiſcoporum, dicerentque, vt haec defenderent, planè quaſi de caelo
mandatum haberent quale Apoſtoli habuerant, obediendum Deo magis eſſe
quàm hominibus. Which refractary proceeding, how much he diſliked, is
declared by him (Pag: 31.) Novum caetum, &amp; vt nunc loqui mos eſt,
Ecclefiam colligere mihi, etiamſi liceret, non liberet, video quàm
malè id aliis ceſſerit: Multiplicarunt numerum, &amp; non
laetitiam.</q> If you ponder the words of Grotius, you cannot chuſe but
ſee, how perfectly they agree to Luther and his followers, and clearely
confute this your Memorandum. And indeed, whoſoever conſiders this Point,
will find it to be no better then non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, and a contradiction, to alledg
this cauſe for juſtifying your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; ſince before any
Excommunication, men leaue the Church by profeſſing a contrary Faith, and
in vertue of that new Faith forſake Her Communion, and yet ſay, that they
leaue it, becauſe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, as a condition of our Communion, that they
leaue not that which neceſſarily, and as I may ſay, eſſentially, and
antecedently, they of themſelves do leaue, whether we require it or no; and
therfore <pb n="498" facs="tcp:59214:258"/>our requiring it, cannot be the cauſe of that
Effect, which is preexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent before that, which you ſay is the cauſe
therof, and would be the ſame, whether we required it or no; and we may
ſay, that Heretiks are the firſt, as it were to excommunicate, and divide
themſelves, before the Church can excommunicate them: Therfore this
allegation of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing vnder payne of Excommunication a neceſſity
&amp;c:</hi> is plainly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and all muſt be reduced to the cauſe
it ſelfe; whether our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines be ſufficiently and clearly convinced to
be Errours; and then, whether ſuch Errours being not Fundamentall, can be
ſufficient to cauſe a ſeparation. And ſo I retort this ground and
ſay, that ſince you confess our Errours alone not to be a ſufficient
cauſe, to excuſe your ſeparation from vs, (and for this reaſon you
ſay Proteſtants are not obliged to ſeparate themſelves from one
another) you muſt alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that indeed they had no ſufficient
cauſe to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all Churches.</p>
               <p n="63">63. Secondly; Yourſelfe contradict this Memorandum.
For, (Pag: 276. N. 59.) You ſay: <hi>Though your corruptions in doctrine, in
themſelves (which yet is falſe) did not, yet your obliging vs, to profess
your doctrine vncorrupted againſt knowledg and Conſcience, may induce an
obligation to depart from your Communion.</hi> Now if our <hi>corruptions in
themſelves, induce an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to depart from our</hi> Communion, this
obligation is induced before <hi>the impoſing vpon men vnder paine of
Excommunication</hi> a neceſſity of profeſſing <hi>knowne Errours;</hi>
and why then do you ſay, that <hi>impoſing vpon men vnder payne of
Excommunication a neceſſity of profeſſing knowne Errours, is the
cauſe which Proteſtants alledg to juſtify their ſeparation?</hi> Since
there is another cauſe precedent to that, and ſuch a cauſe, as without
it, this other of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing vpon men &amp;c:</hi> cannot ſubſiſt.
For, if our Errours, in themſelves, do not impoſe vpon you an obligation to
forſake vs, it is a ſigne, that they are not damnable in themſelves, nor
neceſſarily to be avoided; and conſequently, you may, and ought, to
remaine with vs, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch Errours; and if you ought to do
ſo, the Church may juſtly command it vnder payne of Excommunication, as a
puniſhment of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent obſtinacy, and a medicine to prevent it for tyme
to come; and ſo yourſelfe overthrow this memorandum, wherby you would
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your diviſion from the Church. Yet on the other ſide, if our
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended errours do in themſelves induce an obligation to forſake our
Church, different Sects of Proteſtants muſt, for the ſame reaſon,
forſake one another, becauſe you deny not their Errours to be in 
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:59214:259"/>themſelves damnable, and therfore you put a difference
between them and vs, only becauſe they exact not of others a profeſſion
of their errours, and we do; and ſo you reduce all, to this exacting, or not
exacting, a profeſſion of known errours; and not to the errours in
themſelves, and yet we haue heard you ſay, that our Errours, (in diverſe
of which, chiefe learned Proteſtants agree with vs againſt their Brethren)
in themſelves induce an obligation vpon you to forſake vs. What is here but
contradicting, ſaying, and vnſaying, the ſame thing? Which ſhewes, that
with you nothing is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, except that you are certaine of nothing; And
conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could haue no neceſſary and certaine reaſon, to forſake
all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p n="64">64. Thirdly; To bring you out of the cloudes, and to
vnderſtand things as they are: The ſeparation we meane (when there is
ſpeech of diviſion by Schiſme and Hereſy) is not that ſeparation
which is cauſed by the Eccleſiaſticall cenſure of Excommunication,
which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives men of the publike ſuffrages of Gods Church, of vſe of
Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and converſation with faithfull people, and may conſiſt with
the Grace of God and Charity, not only when it is vnjuſt, but alſo when the
party cenſured, repents himſelfe by perfect contrition of the ſin for
which the Cenſure was impoſed, though he be not actually ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from
it, in regard of ſome cauſe or invincible impediment, which is not in his
power to alter or remooue, but hartily deſires to be abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſo is
vnited to the Church in voto. And this Cenſure of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, is wont
to be inflicted, not only for Schiſme, or Hereſy, but for other offences
alſo, againſt God or our neighbour. But Luther and his fellowes,
voluntarily put themſelves vpon another kind of ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit, from
the profeſſion of the ſame Faith, and externall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Sacraments,
Liturgy &amp;c. vpon pretence of Errours in the Faith, and corruptions in the
diſcipline of the Church; and were ſo farr from repenting themſelves of
ſuch their proceedings, or admitting any votum or deſire, to be vnited with
the Church, that they held all ſuch repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be a ſin; wherby they
certainly exclude themſelves from Gods Grace, and Charity: and ſo it
appeares, that by meere Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one is not ſeparated from the
Church as a Schiſmatike is; nor is a Schiſmatike firſt ſeparated
becauſe he is excomunicated, but is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, becauſe he is a
Schiſmatike, and had been divided from the Church, though he had never been
excommunicated, or though the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication <pb n="500" facs="tcp:59214:259"/>were taken
away. Beſides as I touched already, it is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to ſay, that the
Church requires as a condition of her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the profeſſion of her
errours in Faith, and externall Communion in Sacraments, Liturgy, and other
publike worſhip of God. For profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame Faith, and
communion in Sacraments &amp;c. is the very thing, wherin Communion
conſiſts, or rather is the Communion itſelfe, and therfore is not an
extrinſecall or accidentall condition, voluntarily required by the Church, or
to be conceived as a thing ſeparable from her communion; and ſo you
ſpeake, as if one ſhould ſay, Profeſſion of the ſame Faith is a
condition required for Communion in profeſſion of the ſame Faith. It was
therfore no condition required by vs, that made Proteſtants leaue our
Communion; but they firſt left our Communion by their Voluntary proper Act of
leaving vs, which eſſentially is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with our Communion. This
whole matter will appeare more clearly by the next Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="95">95. Fourthly; Either there was juſt cauſe for your
ſeparation from the Communion of the Church, or there was not. If not; then
by your owne confeſſion you are Schiſmatiks, ſeing you define Schiſme
to be a cauſeless ſeparation: in which caſe, the Church may juſtly
impoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of Excommunication a neceſſity of your returne, and
then your Memorandum cannot haue place, nor can excuſe you from Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
ſince ſuch an impoſing a neceſſity, would, vpon that ſuppoſition,
be both lawfull, and neceſſary. If there were juſt cauſe for your
ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then you had been excuſed from Schiſme, though the Church
had never impoſed, vnder payne of Excommunication, a neceſſity of
profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing knowne errours; becauſe you, ſay, Schiſme is a Cauſless
ſeparation; and ſurely that ſeparation is not cauſeleſſe, for which
there is juſt cauſe. Wherfore your Memorandum about impoſing vpon men a
neceſſity &amp;c: is both impertinent, and incoherent with your firſt
Memordium; <hi>That not every ſeparation, but a cauſeless ſeparation is
the ſin of Schiſme.</hi> And yet (P. 282. N. 71.) you ſay expreſſly:
<hi>It is to be obſerved, that the chief part of our defence, that you deny
your Communion to all that deny or doubt of any part of your doctrine, cannot
with any colour be imployed against Proteſtants: who gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t their communion to
all who hold with them not all things, but things neceſſary, that is,
ſuch as are in Scripture plainly delivered:</hi> So ſtill you vtter
contradictions. Wherfore the confeſſed <hi>chife part of your
defenſe,</hi> being confuted, both by evident reaſon, and out of your owne
ſayings, it remaines that you will never be able to acquit yourſelfe of
Schiſme.</p>
               <pb n="501" facs="tcp:59214:260"/>
               <p n="66">66. Fiftly; How can you maintayne this your Memorandum,
and not giue full ſcope, to all other Proteſtants, who belieue not all the
39. Articles of the Church of England to be true (of whom I am ſure you are
one,) to forſake her communion, ſeing ſhe excommunicates all who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<hi>ſhall affirme, that the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles are in any parte
ſuperſtitious or erroneous.</hi> Is not this the very thing, which you
ſay is <hi>the cheef part of your defence</hi> for your ſeparation from vs?
O Approbators! Is it conforme to the doctrine, and diſcipline of the Church
of England, to ſay, Her communion may, and muſt, be forſaken? And with
what conſcience could you <hi>Mr. Chillingworth,</hi> communicate with
Engliſh, and other Proteſtants in their publike ſervice, corrupted with
errours about the Trinity, the Creed of S. Atha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c: as you belieue it is.
Or why could you not communicate with vs? Or how will you excuſe Luther who
left vs?</p>
               <p n="67">67. Yet I muſt not here omitt to obſerue ſome
Points: Firſt; what a thing your Religion is, which can ſo well agree, and
hold communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with innumerable Sects, infinitly differing one from another?
and yet you conceiue yourſelfe to be obliged, to parte from vs Catholiks. But
ſo it is. The falſe Gods of the Heathens, and their Idolaters, could
handſomly agree amongſt themſelves, but in no wiſe with the true God,
and his true worſhippers! An evident ſigne, that the Catholique Roman
Religion is only true, and teaches the right worſhip of God, and way to
ſalvation. Falſhoods may ſtand togeather, but cannot conſiſt with
truth.</p>
               <p n="68">68. Secondly: If, as you tell vs, things neceſſary be
<hi>ſuch as are in Scripture plainly deliuered,</hi> points not Fundamentall
of themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Fundamentall, becauſe they are revealed in
Scripture, and it is Fundamentall to the Faith of a Chriſtian to belieue all
Truths ſufficiently propoſed, as revealed by God, as Potter expreſſly
grants. Seing then, Proteſtants differ in points, which one part verily
belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, to be plainly delivered in Scripture, and conſequently in things
neceſſary, according to your aſſertion; they cannot grant their
commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to thoſe, who hold not with them in ſuch neceſſary points,
that is in effect, in all things wherin they diſagree. For, every one judges
his opinions to be plainly delivered in Scripture. How then can they be
excuſed from Schiſme, in their ſeparation from vs, while they hold
Communion with other Proteſtants, and thinke they may, and ought to do ſo,
and that in doing otherwiſe they ſhould be Schiſmatiks? Which Argument
ſtill preſſes them more forcibly, if we reflect that many of 
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:59214:260"/>the moſt learned Proteſtants, in divers chiefe
Articles of Faith, ſtand with vs Catholiks, againſt their pretended
Brethren; and therfore they muſt either parte from them, or not parte from
vs,</p>
               <p n="69">69. Thirdly; it appeares by your express words that they
who differ in Points neceſſary, muſt divide from one another, though
neither part impoſe vpon the other a neceſſity of profeſſing known
Errours: and ſince every one thinks his Doctrine to be neceſſary, that
is, plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivered in Scripture, he cannot communicate with any of a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Faith, though they do not pretend to impoſe a neceſſity &amp;c:
And ſo your memorandum about impoſing a neceſſity &amp;c: Which, you
ſay is the chiefe part of your defenſe, comes to nothing, even by your owne
grounds: and therfore you haue indeed no defenſe at all, to free
your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Schiſme.</p>
               <p n="70">70. Fourthly; When we ſpeake of Points of Faith not
Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, it is alwayes vnderſtood, that they be ſufficiently
propoſed, and therfore are alwayes Fundamentall per accidens, and the
contrary Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours certainly damnable, and conſequently a neceſſary
cauſe of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, no leſſe then Errours againſt Points
Fundamentall of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves: and ſeing according to Proteſtants, there
can be no damnable Errour againſt Faith, vnless either it be, or be
eſteemed, repugnant to ſome Truth plainly delivered in Scripture, which you
ſay is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point, the concluſion muſt be, that,
Proteſtants differ in neceſſary Points, and therfore according to your
owne aſſertion, are obliged to forſake one another, without expecting any
Impoſing a neceſſity of profeſſing knowne Errours; and that this your
Memorandum or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is both impertinent and falſe: or if, as I ſayd,
they are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to parte one from another, they could not without
Schiſme depart from vs.</p>
               <p n="71">71. Fiftly; to come to the Point, and ſtrike at the
roote. Tell me, whether you may be ſeriouſly preſent, as members of one
community and, as I may ſay, parts in the Quire, with any ſort of people,
in their Liturgy, and publike ſervice, or worſhip of God, as long as they
do not expreſſly demand of you, a profeſſion of thoſe particular
Points, wherin you diſagree? If you may; then you may joyne yourſelfe with
Turks, Jewes, or even Pagans, if they exact not of you ſuch a
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; which to any Chriſtian muſt needs appeare moſt abſurd
and impious. If you cannot communicate with thoſe of a belief different from
yours, though they do not exact a profeſſion of their Faith, againſt your
owne belief and conſcience; it ſtill followes clearly, that your 
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:59214:261"/>Memorandum of impoſing a neceſſity of
profeſſing knowne Errours, is impertinent; ſeing you cannot communicate
with thoſe of a different Faith, though they impoſe it not vpon you; and
alſo that either Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants cannot communicate one with another, ſince
they differ in Faith, or els that they could not forſake vs vpon pretence,
that we impoſe vpon you a neceſſity of profeſſing knowne Errours;
Seing that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of impoſing &amp;c: is impertinent. Into how many
difficultyes and contradictions do you caſt yourſelf by impugning the
Truth? But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of this Memorandum, or condition.</p>
               <p n="72">72. Your laſt Memorandum was: <hi>That, to leaue the
Church and to leaue the externall Communion of a Church, is not the ſame
thing: That being done by ceaſing to be a member of it, by ceaſing to haue
thoſe requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes which conſtitute a man a member of it, as Faith and
obedience: this by refuſing to communicate with any Church in her Liturgyes,
and publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="73">73. Anſwer, I wiſh you had declared yourſelf
better. Firſt: (Pag: 271. N. 51.) you ſay: <hi>We are not to learne the
difference between Schiſme and Hereſy. For, Hereſy we conceiue an
obſtinate defenſe of any Errour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any neceſſary Article of
the Chriſtian Faith: And Schiſme a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeleſſe ſeparation of one
part of the Church from another.</hi> I haue not tyme to examine what you meane
by <hi>a neceſſary Article of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi> Is not every
Article of Chriſtian Faith neceſſary to be believed, vnder paine of
damnation, if it be ſufficiently propoſed, as revealed by God? And is it
not Hereſy to deny any ſuch Article? If it be ſo, then your
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Article of the Chriſtian Faith implyes no ſuch Myſtery, as
one would haue expected in thoſe ſo limited words: and beſides, if it be
Hereſy to deny any Point, though in itſelfe never ſo ſmall; of
Proteſtants differing in any Point of Faith, ſome muſt be Heretiks, and
in ſtate of damnation, and they muſt be obliged to ſeparate from one
another as from formall Heretiks. If it be not an Hereſy, nor damnable, to
deny any Truth ſufficiently propounded as revealed by God, Errours in Points
not Fundamentall are not damnable: Neither could you, for ſuch Errours,
divide yourſelves from the Communion of all Viſible Churches. If you will
needs ſay, that no Errour is Hereſy, vnless it contradict ſome Article of
itſelfe Fundamentall: What in particular is Hereſy, or who is an Heretik
you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not knowe, ſeing you profeſſe that it cannot be determined in
particular, what Points be Fundamentall; and therfore you muſt retract your
former words; <hi>we are not to learne the <pb n="504" facs="tcp:59214:261"/>difference
between Schiſme and Hereſy.</hi> For, if you cannot poſſibly tell what
Hereſy is, you will for ever be to learne the difference between Schiſme
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Hereſy; to ſay nothing for the preſent that Potter (Pag: 212.)
acknowledges, that <hi>whatſoeuer is revealed in Scripture, or propounded by
the Church out of Scripture, is in ſome ſenſe Fundamentall, that is,
ſuch as may not be denyed, or contradicted without Infidelity:</hi> therfore
it is Hereſy at leaſt, to deny Points ſufficiently propoſed as revealed
by God, though they be not Fundamentall in themſelves. And (Pag: 250.) he
declares expreſſly every Errour againſt any Point revealed, to be
Hereſy; in theſe words: <hi>Where the revealed will or word of God is
ſufficiently propounded; there he that oppoſeth is an Heretike, and
hereſy is a worke of the fleſh, which excludeth from Heaven:</hi> (Gal: 5:
20.21.) therfore if you will not contradict Potter, and yourſelf, in
ſeverall places, you muſt confess, that Hereſy may be committed, by
Errour not Fundamentall in itſelfe. But to our purpoſe, you ſay,
<hi>Schiſme is a cauſeless ſeparation of one part of the Church from an
other:</hi> and (Pag: 264. N. 30.) you teach that a <hi>cauſeless
ſeparation from the externall Communion of any Church, is the ſin of
Schiſme.</hi> Put theſe togeather: <hi>Schiſme is a ſeparation of one
part of the Church from an other:</hi> And Schiſme: <hi>is a ſeparation
from the externall communion of any Church,</hi> the Conſequence will be
this: A ſeparation from the externall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of any part of the Church,
is a ſeparation from the part itſelfe, and then, proportionally, a
ſeparation from externall communion of the whole Church, or of all Churches,
muſt be a ſeparation from the whole Church it ſelfe, or from all
Churches; and ſo your diſtinction, <hi>that to leaue the Church and to
leaue the externall communion of a Church, is not the ſame thing,</hi> is
confuted by your owne doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though it make little to our preſent
purpoſe, whether Schiſme be defined, A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of one part of the
Church from an other, as you ſpeake (for, as I ſayed, if a ſeparation
from the Externall Communion of one parte be a ſeparation from the parte it
ſelfe, a ſeparation from the externall communion of the whole church,
muſt be a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the whole Church itſelfe, which is the thing I
intended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve againſt your Memorandum) yet you muſt giue me leaue to
ſay, that your definition overthrowes itſelfe. For, the Nature and
Eſſence of Schiſme, being to ſeparate one from the Church,
neceſſarily it is cauſe that the party ſo divided, is no more a member
or part of that Church, nor a part of any Church; and ſo Schiſme is not a
ſeparation of one part from another, but the Church which remaynes after
ſuch a ſparation made in externall Communion, is one whole Church 
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:59214:262"/>and Totum eſt cujus nihil eſt extra, and ſo he who
is cut off from the Church, as Schiſmatiks are, is no part of it but a non
ens, or nothing, for as much as belongs to the Denomination, of being a part of
the Church; in which reſpect, your definition, as I ſayd, deſtroyes
itſelfe, as if one could be cut off from the Church by Schiſme, and yet
remaine a part therof. A man divided from the Church, remaynes a man, and is
part of the Community or number of men, but is not a part or member of the
Church; as you will not deny, but that if, for example, one ſhould forſake
all Chriſtianity, yea and fall into Judaiſme, Turciſme, or Paganiſme,
he ſhould ſtill be a part of the number of men, but not a member, or part,
of any Chriſtian Church: And it is ridiculous to ſay, that Luther and his
aſſociats, did not ſeparate from themſelves; ſeing by their very
ſeparation, they ceaſed to be any part of the Church, and the Church
remayned one whole, and ſo by their not ſeparation from themſelves as
men, you cannot inferr that they did not ſeparate from all Churches, and from
all true members, and parts, of all true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Yea, if they be
conſidered as members of the Church, they did in ſome ſort ſeparate
even from themſelves, by ceaſing to be now, what once they were, that is,
true members of the Church. But we ſhall ſay more of this herafter. Only I
obſerue now, if (as you ſay Pag: 264. N. 30.) the ſin of Schiſme be
<hi>a cauſeleſſe ſeparation from the externall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of any
Church,</hi> much more grievous muſt that ſin be, in him, who ſeparates
from the whole Church, or from all Churches, as Luther profeſſed to
doe.</p>
               <p n="74">74. Secondly; When you ſay, <hi>The requiſites which
conſtitute a man a member of the Church, are Faith, and Obedience.</hi> What
Faith, or what Obedience meane you? That Faith wherby one believes, and that
Obedience, wherby one obeyes all the Definitions, and Decrees of the Church? If
ſo; then you ſuppoſe him to be vnited with the Church, not only in Faith,
but alſo in externall Communion; becauſe nothing is more ſtrictly
commanded, than ſuch an vnion and Communion; but then, you are out of our
caſe, of being ſeparated from the Church. If you meane, Faith and Obedience
to God; it is impoſſible, even by your owne confeſſion, that one
ſhould obey God, and divide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the externall Communion of all
Churches without cauſe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfore he cannot by any ſuch imaginary
Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be a member of the Church. You ſay (Pag: 272. N. 53.) <hi>It
concernes every man who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates from any Churches Communion, even as much
as his ſalvation is <pb n="506" facs="tcp:59214:262"/>worth, to looke moſt carefully to
it that the cauſe of his ſeparation be juſt and neceſſary: For,
vnless it be neceſſary it can hardly be ſufficient:</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you
ſuppoſe, there is a ſtrict command not to ſeparate from any Churches
Communion, without neceſſary cauſe. And then, as for Faith, you ſay
(Pag: 134. N. 13.) Among the conditions which Chriſt requires for
ſalvation, <hi>one is, that we belieue what he has revealed, when it is
ſufficiently declared to haue been revealed by him:</hi> Therfore, ſay I,
whoſoever oppoſes a Point, though not Fundamentall in it ſelfe, yet
ſufficiently propounded as revealed by God, failes in the condition of
Obedience required for ſalvation, and ſo wants one of the requiſites,
which conſtitute a man a member of the Church; therfore he leaves the Church,
and Proteſtants erring in ſuch Points, divide themſelves from the Church;
and certaine it is, that ſome of them muſt erre in Points at leaſt not
Fundamentall.</p>
               <p n="75">75. Thirdly; The Church eſſentially implyes not only
Faith, but alſo externall Communion in Sacraments, Liturgy, and publike
wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; therfore whoſoever leaves the externall Communion of a
Church, he cannot but leaue the Church, as being divided from it, in a thing
eſſentiall to the Church, and conſequently without which one cannot be a
member thereof (Moulin Lib: 1. cont: Peron: Cap: 26.) ſaith plainly; <hi>That
is the true Church, which is vnited togeather in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of true Faith,
and Communion of Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi>
And Calvin (Lib: 4. Inſtitut: Cap: §. 4.) ſaith; <hi>We cannot haue
two or three Churches, but Chriſt muſt be divided.</hi> Wherby it appeares,
that men cannot be of one Church, vnless they be vnited in one common
myſticall Body; for example, John hath a head, a hand, &amp;c: and ſo hath
Thomas; but they are not ſaid to communicate in one head, or hand, becauſe
the parts of their Body are not vnited in one common linke, or whole Body.
Different Kingdomes, and Commonwealths, may chance to haue the ſame La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
Cuſtomes, Statutes, yea and the ſame forme of Government; yet that is not
enough, to denominate them one Kingdome, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth; becauſe they haue
not any ſuch vnion, or Communion, as may make them one myſticall Body. Dr.
Lawd, (Pag: 300.) Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, that the Donatiſts agreed in Faith with the
Catholike Church, and yet grants that they were Schiſmatiks, and divided from
the Church; which Diviſion being ſuppoſed, they could not be properly
ſaid to communicate with Her even in Faith, becauſe ſimilitude alone
without a common vnion in ſome Whole, cannot make one a member 
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:59214:263"/> 
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="507" facs="tcp:59214:264"/>or part of one Church. But what
need I proue, a thing evident in it ſelfe? The very Definition of Schiſme,
taken properly, as it is diſtinct from Hereſy, implyes an agreement in
Faith, and that ſuppoſed, it is a ſeparation in externall Communion only;
therfore ſimilitude in Faith, is not ſufficient to make that one be not
truly ſaid to forſake the Church. Jewes and Turks belieue one God, and ſo
do Chriſtians, and yet they cannot be ſayd to be in Communion with
Chriſtians, even in that Point which all of them belieue; in regard they make
not on my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Body. I may eate the ſame meate, which an excommunicate
perſon eates, but I may not eate with him, not he with me: So Jewes and Turks
belieue ſome Truth which we belieue, yet properly ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, they belieue
not with vs, becauſe they themſelves are divided from vs. One thing
therfore it is, to belieue the ſame Point, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be vnited in the
beliefe therof. Neither is there in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, any difference between
Fundamentall, and not Fundamentall Points. For, though one belieue all the
ſame Fundamentall Points, which another believes, yet he believes them not
with him, becauſe, as I ſayd, the believers themſelves, are divided in
Communion, one from another. Otherwiſe, if you will needs haue all thoſe to
be of one Church, who belieue all Fundamentall Points; it will follow, that
there is no Schiſme at all, as it is diſtinguiſhed from Hereſy. For,
that doctrine being ſuppoſed, if one belieue all Fundamentall Points, he is
no Schiſmatike. If he erre in any Fundamentall, or Neceſſary Point, he is
an Heretike: Therfore Schiſme, in this way, ſhall never be
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from Hereſy, which yet is contrary to your owne doctrine;
which we cited aboue out of your (Pag: 271. N. 51.) Where you ſay; <hi>We are
not to learne the difference betweene Schiſme and Herely. For, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy we

defence of any errour againſt, any neceſſary Article of the Chriſtian
Faith: And Schiſme a cauſless ſeparation of one part of the Church from
another.</hi> You do, not declare, wherin this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of one part of the
Church from another, conſiſts. But ſeing you diſtinguiſh Schiſme
from Hereſy, and affirme, that ſeparation by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, conſiſts in
Errours againſt any neceſſary Article of Faith, Schiſme muſt
conſiſt in a ſeparation from the externall Communion of that Church, with
which one agrees in all <hi>neceſſary Articles of the Chriſtian
Faith,</hi> and conſequently, agreement in Fundamentall Articles, is not
ſufficient to conſtitute men members of one Church, ſeing it may ſtand
with Schiſme, taken in the moſt proper ſenſe, which you ſay
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates <pb n="508" facs="tcp:59214:264"/>one part of the Church from another: And
therfore whoſoever divides himſelfe from the externall Communion of the
Church, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from the Church it ſelfe; and ſo your Memorandum
<hi>that to leaue the Church, and to leaue the externall Communion of a Church,
is not the ſame thing,</hi> is a meere vngrounded ſpeculation. Here alſo
that which I haue often told you, offers it ſelfe to be inſinuated; that
Errours in Points not Fundamentall, ſufficiently propounded as teſtifyed by
God, become Fundamentall, that is, damnable, and are true Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes, as
Potter grants; and, as I ſhewed out of your owne words, they who are guilty
of ſuch Errours, obſerue not that Obedience, which is required as a
Condition for remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation; and yet you require
Obedience as one <hi>of thoſe requiſites which conſtitute a man, a member
of the Church,</hi> and therfore a ſeparation by Errours in Points not
Fundamentall, is not pure Schiſme, but more; it is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy; and ſeparates
a man from the Church, though he beleeue all Points which are Fundamentall of
themſelves; ſo that, as I ſaied, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in ſuch Points which are
Fundamentall of themſelves, is in no wiſe ſufficient, to make one a
member of the Church; yea and beſide agreement in beliefe, both of
Fundamentall, and not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Points, it is eſſentially required,
that he be not divided from her externall Communion; and yourſelfe ſay
(Pag: 264. N. 30.) <hi>A cauſleſſe ſeparation from the externall
Communion of any Church is the ſin of Schiſme;</hi> which were not true, if
the ſame beliefe of all Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls (yea and vnfundamentalls alſo) were
of it ſelfe, ſufficient to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, and conſerue one a member of the
Church. For, then he ſhould remaine ſuch a member by that beliefe alone,
though he did cauſeleſly divide himſelfe from the externall Communion of
the Church. And therefore we muſt conclude out of your owne grounds againſt
your laſt Memorandum, that <hi>to leaue the Church, and to leaue the
externall Communion of a Church,</hi> is the ſame thing. And thus, having
confuted your Remembrances, wherby you pretended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe yourſelfe from
Schiſme, let vs now ſee what you can object againſt vs.</p>
               <p n="76">76. Object: 1. You ſay (Pag: 132. N. 11.) <hi>If you
would at this tyme propoſe a forme of Liturgy, which both ſide shold
lawfull, and then they would not joyne with you in this liturgy, you might haue
ſome colour then to ſay, they renounce your Communion
abſolutely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="77">77. Anſwer. What a Chimera do you fancy to yourſelfe,
and <pb n="509" facs="tcp:59214:265"/>propoſe to vs? Firſt: you muſt ſuppoſe,
that the Roman Church holds all eſſentiall, and Fundamentall Points of
Faith: otherwiſe, ſhe ſhould ceaſe to be a Church, and ſo you could
not communicate with Her, as with a Church, neither could there be any Liturgy
common to her and Proteſtants; and then, why do you ſo often blame
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> for affirming, that Potter acknowledged vs, to hold
all ſubſtantiall and Fundamentall Points of Faith, which now yourſelf
muſt ſuppoſe: and alſo (Pag: 269. N. 45.) you ſay: That <hi>men of
different opinion, may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Church: Provided, that what
they forſake, be not one of thoſe things wherin the eſſence of the
Church conſiſts.</hi> And therfore no forme of Liturgy, can be ſufficient
to warrant your joyning with vs, if we erre in Points Fundamentall of
themſelves.</p>
               <p n="78">78. Secondly; Seing no Forme of Liturgy could be lawfull,
in caſe it did containe any Fuudamentall Errour, and that you confeſſe it
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to know, what Points in particular be Fundamentall, it
follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, that you cannot know what forme of Liturgy is lawfull, and ſo in
practiſe, you cannot communicate with one another, nor with vs, nor with any
Church, at all, as not knowing, whether in their Liturgy there be not contained
ſome Fundamentall Errours; yea no man can frame any ſet Forme to
himſelfe, but may feare leaſt it containe ſome ſuch Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Neither
can you avoide this difficulty, by ſaying, as you are wont to doe, that
whoſoever believes all that is evident in Scripture, is ſure to belieue all
Fundamentall Points. For, we ſpeake not now in generall, of what every one
believes for himſelfe, but in practiſe, of a particular Forme of Liturgy,
wherin he communicates with others, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be lawfull, if it containe
any Fundamentall Errour, as well it may, for ought you can know, who profess
not to know, what errours be Fundamentall; vnless for a ſhort Forme of
Liturgy, you will propoſe the whole Bible, which in your grounds is the only
way to know all Fundamentall Points.</p>
               <p n="79">79. Thirdly; Some Points may be neceſſary for the
conſtitution of a Church, which are not neceſſary for every private
perſon, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to know who are lawfull Governous of, and
Miniſters in the Church, and conſequently, by whom the publike Liturgy, is
to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully read to the people. For, ſeing we belieue your pretended
Biſhops in England, to be no more then meere Lay men (as thoſe
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants who ſtand for Epiſcopacy, muſt hold the ſame of
Miniſters not ordayned by Biſhops) what Liturgy, can be found common to
Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks, <pb n="510" facs="tcp:59214:265"/>and Proteſtants, or to Proteſtants, among
themſelves, ſeing there can be no agreement, who be Lawfull Miniſters,
for celebrating the Liturgy, officiating, reading publike Service, and
preaching to the people?</p>
               <p n="80">80. Fourthly; I muſt put you in mynd, that you and
Potter affirme (and the thing in it ſelfe is very certaine, and cleare) that
it is Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to a Chriſtians Faith, not to deny any Truth
ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as revealed by God, though in it ſelfe not
Fundamentall; and therfore there can be no Communion, with any Church, which
denyes any ſuch Point, becauſe ſhe ceaſes to be a Church. Seing then,
you ſay we erre in ſuch Points, and diverſe learned Proteſtants hold
with vs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their pretended Brethren, and Proteſtants ſay, that
different Sects among themſelves, diſagree in ſuch Points; all theſe
muſt hold, that all the reſt diſagreeing from them, are no Church, and
conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not capable of their Communion. How then ſhall all ſuch no
chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, agree in one Forme of Liturgy, common to all Churches? Since they
differ in the very eſſence, and being of a Church, which is prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to
all Communion of Churches, in any lawfull Forme of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. They may be a
company of men, but not one community, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or Church of faithfull
Believers.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Fifthly; You teach, that, minimum vt ſic, is to
<hi>belieue, That God is, and is a rewarde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Would you haue a Liturgy ſo ſhort as
to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine only this point, for feare of Errour, if it ſhould containe
more? And yet even in this one point, there could be agreement only in words
among Proteſtants themſelves, or with vs. For, in the ſenſe, I haue
ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed elſwere, that Proteſtants diſagree about Faith, or what to
belieue ſignifies; and about the Attributes, and perfections of the Deity;
and his Title of a Rewarder; and about our Saviour Chriſt, whether he be true
God? Whether he be to be adored? Whether to be invoked (Vid: Volkel: Lib: 4.
Cap: 11.) Whether reverence to be done to his ſacred name, Jeſus? And many
other ſuch points. And then I pray, what Communion could there be in a
worſhip of God, conſiſting only in words or in prating like parrots, with
infinite difference in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them; and ſuch a difference, as one
part holds the contrary to belieue damnable errours, even in that one Point in
which they muſt be ſuppoſed to agree, as in a Forme common to all; in
Errours, I ſay, damnable, as being repugnant to the Teſtimony of that God,
whom they pretend to worſhip? Jewes and Turks, belieue that God is, and 
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:59214:266"/>that he is a rewarder, and Philoſophers believed that
there is a God, and ſome of them, in generall, that he is a rewarder. What a
ſight would it be, to behold all theſe in one Church, or Quire of
Chriſtians, as agreeing in this generall Liturgy? Of which, Jewes, Turks, and
Philoſophers might ſay in your owne words; Behold we <hi>propoſe a Forme
of Liturgy which all ſides hold to be lawfull:</hi> Why then do you not joyne
with vs? If you anſwer them, becauſe they erre in other points; they might
reply, what is that to the purpoſe, as long as a neceſſity of
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing thoſe Errours, is not impoſed vpon you? Or if it be not
lawfull, to communicate with men of different Faith and Religion, though they
do as it were abſtract from that in which they differ, how can Catholiks
communicate with you, or Proteſtants with one another? or how can you ſay
<hi>(If you would propoſe a Forme of Liturgy which both ſides hold
law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and then they would not joyne with you in this Liturgy, you might
haue ſome colour then to ſay, they renounce your Communion
abſolutely)</hi> ſeing men of different faith cannot communicate togeather,
even in a Forme of Liturgy which both ſides hold lawfull? Or if they may; you
cannot refuſe your Communion to Jewes and Turks, in ſuch a common Forme of
Liturgy. I therfore conclude, that either you may communicate with Jewes,
Turkes &amp;c. or els you muſt confess, that men of different faith cannot
communicate in one Liturgy, and publike worſhip of God, whatſoever
imaginary Forme be propoſed, and that you renounce our Communion
abſolutely; which you deny againſt all Truth, and your owne grounds, and
the common grounds of Chriſtianity, (vnless you will make vp one Church of
Jewes, Turks, Philoſophers, condemned Heretiks, and whatſoever different
Sects) and therfore you cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide the juſt imputation of Schiſme.</p>
               <p n="82">82. Morover, we know, you diſliked diverſe Points, in
the publike Service of the Proteſtants Church of England, as the Myſtery of
the Bleſſed Trinity, the Creed of S. Athanaſius, &amp;c: Now I aske,
whether you could with a good conſcience be preſent at the Engliſh
Service, or no? If you ſay, you could, becauſe your intention was carryed
only to that which was good and true, and not to thoſe particulars, which you
did belieue to be falſe, and errours; why may not Proteſtants, on their
part, be preſent at Maſſe, and our publike worſhip of God? And why do
they alledg, as a cauſe of their forſaking our externall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in
Liturgy, the corruptions thereof? Or why do you require, a Forme of Liturgy,
which all ſides hold lawfull, if one may be preſent, at ſome 
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:59214:266"/>corrupt worſhip of God, ſo that he intend to
participate, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, only in what is good? And you cannot deny, but
that in our Liturgy, there are many good, and holy things out of which, the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d tranſcribed divers things, into their booke
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer wherby they proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves true Heretiks, or chuſers,
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting or rejecting what they pleaſe; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d deceyving ſimple people, as
if there were ſmall differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt Engliſh Proteſtants and Catholiks.
Or how could you wickedly perſwade Catholiks, to go to Proteſtant Service,
which you know we belieue to containe Errours againſt our Faith and Religion,
and yet pretend that Proteſtants were obliged to forſake our Communion in
Liturgy &amp;c. Or if they were not obliged to forſake vs, how can they be
excuſed from Schiſme in doing ſo? If you could not be preſent at the
Engliſh Service, (which was the other part of my demand) the reaſon muſt
be, becauſe men of different Faith, cannot communicate in one publike
worſhip of God, or Liturgy: And the further reaſon of this, becauſe
ſuch a communicating, or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, were indeed a reall, and practicall
approbation of ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and of ſuch a Church, ſtayned with
Errours, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how can one Proteſtant communicate with an
other whom they belieue to erre in points of Faith, and yet thinke they are
obliged not to communicate with vs? Truly they cannot poſſibly giue any
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this their proceeding, and, as I may ſay, acception of
perſons, the merit or demerite of the cauſe being the ſame. For, this
Rule (it is not lawfull for men of different Faith to communicate in Liturgy,
and publike worſhip of God) is vniverſally true, and the contrary is only a
ready way to breed confuſion, ſtiſle all zeale, overthrow Religion, and
is of its owne nature, intrinſecè malum, though there were no
ſcandall, danger of being perverted, and the like, as really alwayes there
are. Certainly, if in any caſe a Catholike can be ſayed to approue, and
participate with Heretikes, as ſuch, it is by communion in the ſame
Liturgy, and divine offices; and never more, than when it happens to be with
ſuch Heretiks, as did purpoſely reject the Liturgy of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks, as
ſuperſtitions, and corrupted, and framed an other, as proper to
themſelves, which happened in England in direct oppoſition to our Liturgy;
to which proceeding of theirs hee in fact conſents, and gives approbation,
who refuſeth not, to be preſent at their Service ſo oppoſite

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o our Liturgy. Whoſoever
conſiders the zeale of all Antiquity, in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring the leaſt ſhaddow of
communion with Heretiks, will haue <pb n="513" facs="tcp:59214:267"/>juſt cauſe to
lament the coldneſſe of them, who ſeeke by diſtinctions, and
ſpeculations, to induce a pernicious participation of juſtice with
Iniquity, a ſociety between light and darkness, an agreement with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hriſt and Belial, a
participation of the faithfull with the infidell, as we haue heard our
adverſaryes confess, every Errour againſt a Divine Truth ſufficiently
propounded, to be Infidelity. Holy Scripture (Num: 16.26.) ſpeaking of Core,
Dathan, and Abiron, ſaith, <hi>Depart from the tabernacles of the impious
men, and touch you not thoſe things which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to them, leaſt you be
enwrapped in their ſin.</hi> What then ſhall we ſay of thoſe, who will
not depart, I ſay not, from the tabernacles, but even from the publike
Service of Heretiks, and will touch, and be of the ſame communion with them?
If the Apoſtle ſayd to Titus, who was a Biſhop, and in no danger of being
perverted, avoide an hereticall man; could he haue ſayd, Fly the man, but not
communion with him? If in any caſe, certainly in this, we muſt call to mynd
our Bleſſed Saviours ſaying, He that denyes me, I will deny him. And,
what doth it availe a man to gaine the whole world if he looſe his owne
ſoule? To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Tertullian ſaieth (de Coron: Mil: Cap 11.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Non admittit ſtatus Fidei
allegationem neceſſitatis. Nulla eſt neceſſitas delinquendi qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
vna eſt neceſſitas non delinquendi.</q> 
                  <hi>The condition of Chriſtian
Faith cannot admitt for excuſe of a thing not lawfull, to ſay, they were
neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therto. There can be no neceſſity of ſinning, for them,
who acknowledg one only thing to be neceſſary, namely, not to ſin.</hi>
What is that one thing, which our ſaviour ſaith is neceſſary, except,
not to ſin? Come loss of goods, liberty, and life: let vs remember; It is not
neceſſary, that we be rich, or at liberty, or enjoy a long, and
proſperous life, but, One thing is abſolutely neceſſary; that we do not
offend our God. If in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affaire, we would guide ſoules by
metaphyſicke, the next ſtep will be, to take the Zuinglian ſupper, not,
forſooth, as it is receaved by them, in nature of a Sacrament, but intending
only to eate it, as it is no more than bread, and wine; or as Chriſtians may
weare the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell which Infidels vſe according to the civill cuſtome of
their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But in matters of this nature, middle wayes are moſt
dangerous, and next to precipices; and you muſt remember thoſe words, (3.
Reg: 18. V. 22.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">If our Lord be God, follow him;</q> but
if Baal, follow him. Upon which place the Doway Teſtament, makes this
profitable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Such zealous expoſtulation is
neceſſary to all Neutralls in Religion, who are neither hot nor cold, but
lukewarme: ſuch as <pb n="514" facs="tcp:59214:267"/>Angells deteſt.</q> (Apoc: 3.)
Less harme it is (if we reſpect the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe which may accrew to others)
for a man to profess Hereſy, than profeſſing himſelfe a Catholike, to
be cauſe, that others follow his Doctrine, and example, in communicating with
Heretiks, in that which they are wont to call, Divine Service. What a monſter
may it juſtly ſeeme for Catholiks; at home, abroad, in their pulpits, and
all other occaſions, to impugne and ſpeake againſt Hereſyes, and the
next day to be ſeene in the ſame Church, at the ſame publike ſervice,
with Heretiks? This Doctrine of the vnlawfulness for Catholiques to be
preſent at the ſervice, or ſermons, of Heretiques, is taught by thoſe
incomparable, holy, zealous, and learned Authors of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations vpon the
Rhemes Teſtament; Cardinal Alane; Richard Briſto; Willyam Raynolds; Gregory
Martin; in Matth: 10. N. 32. Marc: 3. N. 13. 2. Cor: 6. N. 14. Ad Tit: 3. N.
10. Joan: 2. N. 10. And who will not prefer the Authority of theſe men, who
oppoſed themſelves againſt the Hereſy, Policy, and Cruelty of thoſe
tymes, before any who now ſhould preſume to teach the contrary? Vpon the
whole matter therfore, I conclude, that it is impoſſible to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound any
Forme of Liturgy, in which both ſides can hold it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to communicate.
And, therfore Luther and his fellowes did abſolutely renounce the Communion
of all Churches, by profeſſing a contrary Faith, and ceaſing to
communicate with them in Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and publike worſhip of God; which is the
thing you denyed in your Objection.</p>
               <p n="83">83. Object: 2. (Pag: 263. N. 26.) You ſay to your
Adverſarie; <hi>That although it were granted Schiſme, to leaue the
externall Communion of the viſible Church, in what ſtate or caſe ſoever
it be, and that Luther and his followers were Schiſmatiks, for leaving the
externall Communion of all viſible Churches: Yet you faile exceedingly of
clearing the other neceſſary Point vndertaken by you, that the Roman Church
was then the viſible Church. For, neither doe Proteſtants (as you
miſtake) make the true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, and due adminiſtration of
the Sacraments, the notes of the viſible Church, but only of a viſible
Church: Now theſe, you know, are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, the former
ſignifying the Church Catholique, or the whole Church: The latter, a
particular Church, or a part of the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Argument you can never evince, that your Church had theſe notes, yet would it
by no meanes follow, that your Church were the viſible Church, but only a
viſible Church: Not the <pb n="515" facs="tcp:59214:268"/>whole Catholique Church, but
only a part of it. But then beſides, where doth Dr. P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where doth he ſay that you had for the ſubſtance the true preaching of
the word or due adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments? Or where doth he ſay,
that (from which you collect this) you wanted nothing Fundamentall,
neceſſary to ſalvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="84">84. Anſwer. Your conſcience could not but tell you,
that <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> had evidently cleared this Point, and
anſwered your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections (Part: 1. N. 47. Pag: 221.) in theſe words: that
the Roman Church (I ſpeake not for the preſent, of the particular Dioceſe
of Rome, but of all Viſible Churches diſperſed through the whole world,
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Faith with the Chayre of Peter, whether that Sea were ſuppoſed
to be in the City of Rome, or in any other place:) That, (I ſay) The Church
of Rome, in this ſenſe, was the viſible Catholique Church, out of which
Luther departed, is proved by your owne confeſſion, who aſſigne for
Notes of the Church, the true Preaching of Gods word, and true adminiſtration
of Sacraments, both which for the ſubſtance you cannot deny to the Roman
Church, ſince you confess, that ſhe wanted nothing Fundamentall, or
neceſſary to ſalvation; and for that very cauſe, you thinke to cleare
yourſelfe from Schiſme, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as Potter ſayeth (Pag: 76.) is
<hi>to cut off from the Body of Chriſt, and the hope of ſalvation, the
Church from which it ſeparates.</hi> Now, that Luther and his fellowes were
borne and baptized in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, and that ſhe was the Church, out of
which they departed, is notoriouſly knowne: And therfore you cannot cut her
off <hi>from the Body of Chriſt, and hope of ſalvation,</hi> vnless you
will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg your ſelfe to deſerue the juſt imputation of Schiſme.
Neither can you deny her to be truly Catholique by reaſon of (pretended)
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, not Fundamentall. For, your ſelfe avouch, and endeavour to
proue, that the true Catholique Church may erre in ſuch Points. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I
hope you will not ſo much as goe about to proue, that when Luther roſe,
there was any other true Viſible Church, diſagreeing from the Roman, and
agreeing with Proteſtants in their particular doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines: And you cannot
deny, but that England in thoſe dayes agreed with Rome, and other nations
with England: and therfore either Chriſt had no Viſible Church vpon Earth,
or els you muſt grant, that it was the Church of Rome. A truth ſo
manifeſt, that thoſe Proteſtants who affirme the Roman Church to haue
loſt the Nature and Being of a true Church, do by inevitable conſequence
grant, that for diverſe <pb n="516" facs="tcp:59214:268"/>Ages Chriſt had no Viſible
Church an earth: From which Errour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Dr. Potter diſclaimeth, he
muſt of neceſſity maintaine, that the Roman Church is free from
Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d damnable Errours, and that ſhe is <hi>not cut off from the
Body of Chriſt, and Hope of ſalvation. And if,</hi> (ſaith he ibidem)
<hi>any Zealops amongſt vs</hi> haue proceeded to <hi>heavyer Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
their zeale may be excuſed, but their Charity and wiſdome cannot be
juſtifyed.</hi> Thus <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in that place; and then
immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves clearly; that the Grecians, Waldenſes, Wicklef, Huss,
Muſcovites, Armenians, Georgians, Aethiopians, or Abiſſines, either held
damnable Hereſyes, confeſſed to be ſuch both by Catholiks, and
Proteſtants, or els that they agree with vs Catholiks, in the particular
doctrines, wherin Proteſtants haue for ſaken vs. This being ſo; who can
deny, but that if Luther and his followers were Schiſmatiks for leaving the
externall communion of all viſible Churches (which for the preſent you are
content to ſuppoſe) the Roman Church taken in this ſenſe, which you
haue heard <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> declare, was that viſible Church;
ſeing there was no true Church of Chriſt, but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in that ſenſe,
in which ſhe is not a particular, but the vniverſall Church, including all
true Churches. And yet by way of ſupererogation <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi>
ſaid (N. 55. Pag: 229.) that Luther and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had been
Schiſmatiks, though the Roman were but a particular Church; becauſe Potter
(Pag: 76.) ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever profeſſes himſelfe to forſake the
communion of any one member of the Body of Chriſt, muſt confeſſe
himſelfe conſequently to forſake the whole.</hi> Since therfore in the
ſame place he expreſſly acknowledges, the Church of Rome to be a member
of the Body of Chriſt, and that it is cleare they forſooke Her, and
profeſſe to haue done ſo; it followes evidently, that they forſooke the
whole, and therfore are moſt properly Schiſmatiks, for leaving the Roman
Church, whether you take it for a particular, or for the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, Church;
that is, for all Churches which agreed with Her: and ſo your inſtance (P.
263. N. 27.) that <hi>the foote might ſay to the head, I acknowledg there is
a Body: and yet that no member beſides you, is this Body: nor yet that you
are it, but only a part of it</hi>) hath indeed neither head nor foote:
Becauſe when we ſay, the Roman Church is the vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, we
ſpeake not of Her as a particular Church, or part of the whole, but taken
with all other Churches, and conſequently as a Whole; and then you are not to
aske, whether the foote be the whole Body, but whether head, foote, and all
other parts taken together, <pb n="517" facs="tcp:59214:269"/>be not the whole Body: which
if you cannot deny, you muſt confess that your owne inſtance is againſt
yourſelf, and for vs.</p>
               <p n="85">85. By this alſo is anſwered, what you ſay; that,
<hi>Proteſtants make not the true preaching of the word, and due
adminſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Notes of the viſible Church, but only
of a viſibble Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not of the Church Catholique, or the whole Church;
but of a particular Church, or a part of the Catholique.</hi> But out of what
we haue ſayd, this appeares to be a plaine contradiction. For if they be
Notes of every particular Church, or of every part of the whole, they muſt
alſo be Notes of the whole, which is nothing but every part as joyned with
all the reſt, or the parts taken collectiuè, that is, the whole number
of parts, which is nothing but the whole Body conſiſting of ſuch parts:
As if vitall actions, be a Note or ſigne of the preſence of our ſoule, or
life, in every part of our Body, it muſt alſo be a ſigne of life in the
whole Body, conſiſting of all its parts. Will you haue the whole, an Idaea
Platonica, ſeparate from all parts? how then can the true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the
word be a ſigne of every part of the Church, and not of the whole? Or will
you haue the whole or vniverſall Church want an eſſentiall note of a true
Church? But as every where, ſo here you take more vpon you in behalfe of
Proteſtants, than you haue commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from them to doe. The Engliſh
Proteſtant Church (Artic: 19.) ſaith; <hi>The viſible Church of Chriſt
is a congregation of faithfull men, in the which the pure word of God is
preached, and the Sacraments be duly miniſtred.</hi> Where you ſee, the
viſible Church is called a congregation; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no ſuch
neceſſary difference paſſes between the Church, and a Congregation or
Church, as you confidently affirme. Will you ſay, that the Church which you
will haue to ſignify the vniverſall or whole Church, is a congregation,
that is, a particular Church? And yet the ſayd (19. Article) ſaith, The
Church of Chriſt is a congregation that is, according to your Divinity, a
particular Church? Or by what Logick can you ſay, that the Subjectum in a
propoſition can be of a larger extent than the Praedicatum, and the
vniverſall Church affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be a particular Church? Alſo, if preaching
of the word be not a Note of the viſible Church, how comes it to be put in
the very defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of it? Willet in his Synopſis (Pag: 71.) ſaith,
<hi>Theſe markes ean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor be abſent from the Church, it is no longer A true
Church, than it hath theſe markes.</hi> And (Pag: 69.) <hi>The only abſence
of them doth make a nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church.</hi> Behold, Preaching of the word
&amp;c: Markes both of <pb n="518" facs="tcp:59214:269"/>the and a Church; And theſe
markes are ſayd to be eſſentiall to both; yea both the and a, are applied
to the ſame Church: And, as I ſayd, it is ſtrang in you, to imagine that
what is eſſentiall to every part, muſt not neceſſarily be
eſſentiall to the whole; or, that the whole muſt participate of the
parts, and not of that which is eſſentiall to them: or, that the parts by
being vnited to compound one whole, muſt looſe that which was
eſſentiall to them before ſuch an vnion or compoſition, that is, that
they muſt looſe themſelves, by looſing that which was eſſentiall to
them. But if theſe cleare reaſons will not ſerve, at leaſt be content
to be convinced by your owne words (Pag: 294. N. 93.) Where you muſt
ſuppoſe, that, it is a good Argument to make an inference from every one of
the parts to the whole: <hi>What is,</hi> ſay you, <hi>this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church, but the ſociety of men, wherof every particular, and by
conſequence, the whole company is, or may be guilty of many ſins dayly
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt knowledg and conſcience? Now, I would fame vnderſtand,
why one Errour in Faith, eſpecially if not Fundamentall, ſhould not
conſiſt with the holyness of the Church, as well as many and great ſins
committed againſt knowledg and conſcience?</hi> And why then do you not
make the like conſequence, and ſay; the viſible Church is but a ſociety
of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of diverſe Churches wherof every particular, and by
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the whole company hath for eſſentiall Notes, the true
prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Gods Word, and due adminiſtration of Sacraments? This
inſtance convinces ad hominem, and vpon ſuppoſition, that you will make
good your owne inference, which indeed is in it ſelfe of no force, in regard,
that to ſin or erre, is not aſſentiall to every part of the Church, as
preaching of the word is eſſentiall to every particular, and conſequently
to the whole Church; and therfore God may giue his aſſiſtance, to keepe
men from ſin and errour, as he ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and having promiſed,
that the gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole Church, and
not having made any ſuch generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to private perſons, which
neither are, nor do repreſent the whole Church, you cannot inferr, that the
whole Church, or a Generall Councell, may fall into Errour, becauſe every
particular private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, taken apart, may be deceived. Your parity alſo
between ſin and errour, is vnworthy of a Divine. Faith externally
profeſſed, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour profeſſion of Faith, is neceſſary to
conſtitute one a member of the Church; but juſtifying grace, or ſanctity,
or Charity is not. Your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe grant, that Errour in Fundamentall Points,
deſtroyes a Church, <pb n="519" facs="tcp:59214:270"/>and that every particular perſon
ceaſes to be a member of the Church, by every ſuch errour. I hope you will
not ſay the ſame of every, or any grievous ſin. You grant (Pag: 274. N.
57.) that corruptions in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yield no juſt cauſe to forſake a
Church, and yet you excuſe your leaving the Communion of our Church, vpon
pretence of corruptions in Her doctrine, even in Points not Fundamentall of
themſelves. It appeares then, that errours in Faith, though not Fundamentall,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate any, or all, moſt grievous corruptions in manners, in order to
the maintayning or breaking the Communion of the Church. Do you not
expreſſly ſay (Pag: 255. N. 6.) <hi>Many members of the Viſible Church
haue no Charity?</hi> Which could not happen, if Charity were as neceſſary
as Faith, to conſtitute one a member of the Church. This is alſo the
Doctrine of other Proteſtants. Field (Of the Church, Lib: 2. Cap: 2.)
ſaith: <hi>Entire profesſion of thoſe ſupernaturall verityes which God
hath revealed in Chriſt, is eſſentiall to the Church.</hi> Fulke (Joan:
14. Not: 5.) <hi>The true Church of Chriſt can never fall into Hereſy. It
is an impudent ſlander to ſay, we ſay ſo.</hi> Whitaker; Contron: 2.

yet be a Church;</hi> mark heere alſo, that <hi>the,</hi> and <hi>a</hi> are
applied to the ſame Church. Dr. Lawd (Sect: 10. Pag: 36.) <hi>Whatſoever is
Fundamentall to Faith, is Fundamentall to the Church, which is one by vnity of
Faith.</hi> It is then apparent, that there is great difference, between Faith,
and charity, for as much as concernes the conſtituting one a member of the
Church, and the contrary is of dangerous conſequence, as if by deadly ſin,
every Biſhop, Prelate, Paſtour, Prieſt, Prince &amp;c. muſt
neceſſarily ceaſe to be members of Chriſts Church.</p>
               <p n="86">86. But here I muſt obſerue two things. Firſt;
<hi>If entire profesſion of thoſe ſupernaturall verityes, which God hath
revealed in Chriſt, be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to the Church: If the true Church
cannot fall into Hereſy, and that it is an impudent ſlander to affirme that
Proteſtants ſay ſo; if the Church cannot hold any Hereticall Doctrine,
and yet be a Church,</hi> as we haue heard out of Dr. Lawd, Whitaker, Fulke,
and Field, reſpectivè, it followes, that the Church cannot fall into
errour againſt any Truth, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propounded as revealed by God,
whether it be of itſelfe Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall or not; becauſe every ſuch errour
is Hereſy, as contrarily we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a true Act of Faith, by believing a
Truth, becauſe it is teſtifyed by God, though the thing, of itſelfe,
might ſeeme never ſo ſmall. And (Pag: 101. N. 127.) you ſpeake to this
very purpoſe, ſaying, <pb n="520" facs="tcp:59214:270"/>
                  <hi>Hereſy is nothing but a
manifeſt deviation from, and an oppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſition to the Faith.</hi> And Potter
(Pag: 97.) ſaith; <hi>The Catholique Church is carefull to ground all her
declarations in matters of Faith vpon the Divine Authority of Gods written
Word. And therfore whoſoever willfully oppoſeth a judgment ſo well
grounded, is juſtly eſteemed an Heretik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, not properly, becauſe he diſobeyes the
Church, but becauſe he yields not to Scripture ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, or
cleared vnto him.</hi> And (Pag: 250.) Where <hi>the revealed will or word of
God is ſufficiently propounded; there he that oppoſeth, is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of
errour, and he who is thus convinced, is an Heretike.</hi> And (Pag: 247.)
<hi>If a man by reading the Scriptures, or hearing them read, be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of
the truth of any ſuch Concluſion: This is a ſufficient propoſition, to
proue him that gain-ſaieth any ſuch truth, to be an Heretike, and
obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate oppoſer of the Faith.</hi> Field (Lib: 2. of the Church, Cap:
3.) ſayth; <hi>freedome from Fundament all errour, may be found among
Heretiks.</hi> From whence it followes, that errour againſt any Point of
Faith, though not Fundamentall, is Hereſy; and yourſelfe (Pag: 23. N. 27.)
ſay; <hi>There is, as matters now ſtand, as great neceſſity of
believing thoſe Truths of Scripture, which are not Fundamentall, as thoſe
that are.</hi> If then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry errour, againſt any Truth ſufficiently
propounded, as revealed by God, be Hereſy, and that, according to Fulke,
<hi>the true Church of Chriſt can never fall into Hereſy,</hi> and that, as
Whitaker ſaith, the Church <hi>cannot hold any Hereticall doctrine, and yet
be a Church,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that either the Church cannot fall into any
errour, even not Fundamentall, and ſo Proteſtants are Schiſmatiks, for
leaving Her vpon pretence of errours; or that, it is no impudent ſlander to
ſay, that Proteſtants ſay, <hi>the Church may fall into Hereſy,</hi> as
Fulke affirmes it to be, ſeing ſhe may fall into errours againſt Faith,
and all ſuch errours are Hereſyes. Beſides, ſeing we haue heard Potter
confeſſe (Pag: 97.) that <hi>the Catholique Church is carefull to ground
all Her declarations in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith vpon the Divine Authority of Gods
written word;</hi> how can they avoide the Note of Hereſy, by oppoſing Her
Declarations; or of Schiſme by leaving Her Communion? By all which it is
manifeſt, that Heretiks haue no conſtancy in their doctrine, but are forced
to affirme and deny, and by perpetuall contradictions overthrow their owne
grounds, and Aſſertions. Howſoever, for our preſent purpoſe, we haue
proved, even out of Proteſtants themſelves, that your parity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
errours againſt Faith, and ſins againſt Charity, is repugnant to all
Divinity, ſeing externall profeſſion of Faith, is neceſſary to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute <pb n="521" facs="tcp:59214:271"/>one a member of the Church, but Charity is
not; and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I inferr that the Catholique Church is not ſubject to any
errour, though not Fundamentall, ſince it is confeſſed that ſhee cannot
fall into Hereſy, and every errour againſt any revealed Truth, is
He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy.</p>
               <p n="87">87. The ſecond thing I was to obſerue breifly is
this. <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> ſpeaking expreſſly of errours in
Faith, which are incompatible with the being of a true Church; you to
diſguiſe the matter, aske why errour <hi>may not conſiſt with the
holyness of this Church as well as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great ſins.</hi> Wheras
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> did not ſpeake of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but of true Faith,
which is eſſentiall to the Church, and every member therof, as juſtifying
Grace, and Charity, and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (in this ſenſe) are not; ſince many
grievous ſinners are true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church. We profess, I grant, in the
Creed, The Holy Catholique Church, yet not ſo as every member of it muſt
needs be holy by juſtifying Grace, but for many other important reaſons;
which are excellently declared in the Roman Catheciſme ad Parochos, vpon that
Article of the Creed.</p>
               <p n="88">88. You aske: <hi>Where doth Dr. Potter acknowledg any
ſuch matter as you pretend? Where doth he ſay, that you had for the
ſubſtance the true preaching of the word, or due adminiſtration of the
Sacraments? Or where doth he ſay, that (from which you collect this) you
wanted nothing Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall or neceſſary to ſalvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="89">89. Anſwer: It ſhall be proved herafter, to your
ſmall credit, that yourſelfe, Potter, and other Proteſtants, acknowledg
the Roman Church to be a true Church, and not to erre in any Fundamentall, and
Eſſentiall Point; and it is cleare, that ſhe could not be a true Church,
vnless ſhe had for the ſubſtance the true preaching of the word, and due
adminiſtration of the Sacraments, which to be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Notes of the
Church, and without which, the Church ceaſes to be a Church, we haue proved
out of Proteſtants; and then, how can the Roman Church conſerve the
Eſſence of a Church, if it want what is eſſentiall to a Church? Indeed
you are inexcuſable, to aske in this place this Queſtion, ſeing in that
very place which you cite, <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> expreſſly alledges
Potter ſeeking to free himſelfe and other Proteſtants from Schiſme,
becauſe they do not <hi>cut off from the Body of Chriſt, and hope of
Salvation,</hi> our Church; which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they muſt doe, vnleſſe they
belieue that ſhee <hi>wanted nothing Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall <pb n="522" facs="tcp:59214:271"/>or
neceſſary to Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="90">90. In your next Page (264. N. 27.) you ſpeake thus to
your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary: <hi>In vaine haue you troubled your ſelfe in proving, that
we cannot pretend, that either the Greekes, Waldenſes, Wickleffiſts,
Huſſites, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites, Armenians, Georgians, Abyſſines were then the
viſible Church. For all this diſcourſe proceeds from a falſe and vaine
ſuppoſition, and beggs another Point in Queſtion between vs, which is,
that ſome Church of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, and one Communion (as the Roman, the
Greeke &amp;c:) muſt be always, excluſively to all other Communions, the
whole viſible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="91">91. Anſwer. <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> being to proue,
that the Church of Rome, that is, all <hi>Viſible Churches, diſperſed
throughout the whole world agreeing in Faith with the Chayre of Peter,</hi> (as
he expreſſly declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) <hi>was that viſible Catholique Church
out of which Luther departed;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide other reaſons, proves it by a
ſenſible Argument, ab enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione partium, that there was no true
Chriſtian Church or Churches, before Luther, except either thoſe which
agreed with the Roman, or which held wicked errours, condemned by Proteſtants
themſelves, which therfore they muſt deny to haue been members of their
Church: and therfore we muſt either ſay, that Chriſt had no true Church
on earth, or els that it was the Roman, and ſuch as agreed with Her, and
conſequently, that Luther departed out of the Roman Church, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that
ſenſe, that is, out of the Catholique Church, there being then no other
true Church. Now what thinke you, was this labour in vaine? Certainly it was
not; whether we conſider the end which I haue declared, or another of no
ſmall moment, connected with this; which is, as I touched aboue; That wheras
Proteſtants were wont to make ignorant perſons belieue, that before Luther
they had ſome viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proteſtant Church, and to that end would be
naming, the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes, Wicklefiſts, Huſſits, and ſuch others,
<hi>Charity Maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> demonſtrated, that thoſe men held damnable
Errours, againſt both Catholikes and Proteſtants, and in many Points agreed
with vs againſt Proteſtants, and therfore could not be Proteſtants,
though they caſually agreed with them in ſome Points. In the meane tyme,
Proteſtants haue no reaſon to giue you thanks, for leaving them, and in
fact acknowledging, that <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> had evident reaſon for
what he ſayd, and that the old plea of Proteſtants, had no ground of
truth.</p>
               <p n="92">92. You ſay, <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> begs <hi>a
Point in Queſtion between <pb n="523" facs="tcp:59214:272"/>vs,</hi> which is that
<hi>ſome Church of one denomination muſt be always, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively to all
other Communions, the whole viſible Church.</hi> But with what modeſty can
you ſay this? Seing <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> was ſo farr from
ſuppoſing or affirming <hi>ſome particular Church of one denomination to
be alwayes, excluſively to all other, the whole viſible Church,</hi> that
as you haue heard, he expreſſly, and purpoſely, declared himſelf to
ſpeak of all true Viſible Churches, and not of the Roman Church, as it is
taken for the particular Dioceſſe of Rome, and therfore that not any
particular Church, but all true Churches, are the whole Viſible Church.</p>
               <p n="93">93. Object 3. <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Pag:
151. N. 2.) ſaith: <hi>Becauſe Schiſme will be found to be a diviſion
from the Church, which could not happen, vnless there were always a viſible
Church, we will proue, that in all Ages there hath been ſuch a viſible
congregation of faithfull people.</hi> Againſt this, you object (Pag: 254. N.
2.) That, <hi>although there never had been any Church viſible or inviſible
before this Age, nor ſhould be ever after, yet this could not hinder, but
that a Schiſme might now be, and be a diviſion from the preſent viſible
Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="94">94. Anſwer. <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſaid truly,
That ſeing Schiſme is a diviſion from the Church, it cannot happen (for
that is his express word) but when there is a Church: not always, vnless there
be always, a Church; never, if never there were a Church. If then for many
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges there was no Church, there could not happen a Schiſme in all thoſe
Ages. The Fathers, Doctours, and Divines of all Ages, ſpeake and treat of
Schiſme, as of a ſubject and ſin, which morally and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, and
always might happen, (and which de facto did happen too often, as Hereſyes
did, and were inpugned by the writers of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Age) which they could not haue
done, if they had not ſuppoſed the Exiſtence of a Church, through all
Ages and Tymes: And much less would they haue done ſo, if they had ever
imagined, that of ſixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eene hundred yeares and more, there was to be no true
Church for the ſpace of a thouſand, within the compass of which tyme, many
of thoſe Divines did liue, and never dreamed that in Defining, and frequent
treating of Schiſme, they ſpoke of a thing only poſſible, and not
incident to their preſent occaſions, and ſo they had not in winter
defined a roſe, (which is your example (Pag: 260. N. 22.) to proue that a
thing may be defined, though it be not exiſtent) which they were ſure to
ſee the next enſuing ſummer, but rather a conceit little 
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:59214:272"/>better than a Chimaera, or a non ens, which had once
exiſted, though they could not tell how ſhort a tyme, and then
diſappeared as if it had never been. And by this is anſwered, what you
object in the ſayd Page 260. againſt the ſaying of <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Pag: 165. N. 11.) That, <hi>all Devines by defining
Schiſme to be a diviſion from the Church, ſuppoſe, that there muſt be
a knowne Church from which it is poſſible for men to depart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="95">95. Object 4. (Pag: 254. N. 4.) you cite <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> as ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus: That, <hi>ſuppoſing Luther and they
which did firſt ſeparate from the Roman Church, were guilty of Schiſme,
it is certainly conſequent, that all who perſiſt in the diviſion muſt
be ſo likewiſe;</hi> which, ſay you is not <hi>ſo certaine as you
pretend.</hi> But the word certainly which you ſet downe as the word of
<hi>Charity maintayned,</hi> and vpon which you ground your Objection, is not
to be found in his words (Pag: 151.) which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to alledge. Yet
becauſe the thing in it ſelfe is certainly true, let vs heare what you can
object to the contrary. You ſay, <hi>they which alter without neceſſary
cauſe the preſent government of any ſtate Civill or Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall,
do committ a great fault; wherof notwithſtanding they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent who
continue this alteration, and no the vtmoſt of their power oppoſe a chang,
though to the former ſtate, when continuance of tyme hath once ſetled the
preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="96">96. Anſwer. It is no less then great prophaness in you,
to make a parity between a Schiſme from Gods Church, which is
intrinſecè, and eſſentially vnlawfull, and alterations in a Civill
or Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, for things accidentall, and of their nature
indifferent. For, if you ſuppoſe thoſe alterations to be of their owne
nature vnlawfull, and ſinfull, they can never be innocent, who continue them,
nor can any continuance of tyme eſtabliſh them. Luther and his followers,
ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves from the Church, by ſinfull profeſſion of
Faith, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in many Points to the beliefe of all Churches (for you
ſuppoſe, for the preſent, that their ſeparation was cauſeless and
ſinfull, which is to be noted) and will you ſay, it is lawfull to continue
in a falſe profeſſion of Faith, againſt ones conſcience, becauſe
others haue begun it? How ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do you profess, that it is alwayes damnable to
diſſemble, or ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ones conſcience in matters of Faith?
Well then, if (vpon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) he be obliged to profess the whole
Catholique Faith, he muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Points belieue, that it is
abſolutely vnlawfull to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with Heretiks in their Sacraments, and
that there can be no juſt <pb n="525" facs="tcp:59214:273"/>cauſe, to liue out of the
Communion of the Church, and that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, either to begin or continue
a diviſion from Her, and that they are obliged to returne to Her Communion.
And this I proue out of your owne words (Pag: 312. N. 112.) (it ſhould be
113.) where you ſpeake to <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in this manner: <hi>You
ſpend a great deale of reading and witt, and reaſon againſt ſome men,
who pretending to honour and belieue the Doctrine and Practiſe of the
viſible Church (you meane your owne) and condemning their forefathers who
forſooke her, ſay they would not haue done ſo, yet remaine divided from
Her Communion. VVhich men, in my judgment, cannot be defended. For, if they
belieue the doctrine of your Church, then muſt they belieue this doctrine,
that they are to returne to your Communion. And therfore if they do not ſo,
it cannot be avoyded but that they muſt be a'vtocatacritoi.</hi> Behold,
whoſoever believes as we do, muſt alſo belieue, that they cannot continue
this Schiſme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by others. I wiſh all would reflect vpon this grant,
which evidence of truth hath drawne from you, though it hath coſt you a
contradiction againſt your ſaying, that a Schiſme with vs might be begun
with ſin, and yet they <hi>be innocent who continue it.</hi> Your captious
Words, that, <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſhould not haue written againſt
theſe kind of men, in a worke which he profeſſes to haue written
<hi>meerly againſt Proteſtants,</hi> ſhall be anſwered in their proper

               <p n="97">97. Object 5. <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part 1. Pag:

determine whether this objection hath more of the inſolent, or proud, or
malicious: But I abſtaine from cenſures. What <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi>
ſaied, was not his alone, but the Doctrine of all Divines, and in particular
of the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Doctour S. Thomas, whoſe express words he cited, wherin
(2.2. Queſt: 39. Art 1. in Corp:) he defines Schiſme; 
<q rend="margQuotes">A voluntary ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the
vnity of that Charity, wherby all the members of the Church are vnited.
Peccatum, ſaith he, Schiſmatis propriè, eſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciale peccatum
ex eo quod intenditſe ab vnitate ſeparare, quam Charitas facit.</q> In
which words of this holy Doctour, you haue both the affirmation of <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> and the reaſon therof; That as Hereſy is oppoſite to
Faith, ſo Schiſme to Charity: and for that cauſe, Hereſy and Schiſme
are two diſtinct vices. Otherwiſe, how will you <pb n="526" facs="tcp:59214:273"/>diſtinguiſh them? In the ſame place, as alſo (N. 7.)
<hi>Charity Maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> alledges S. Auſtine, (Lib. 1. de Fid: ad Simp:
Cap 10.) ſaying, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Heretiks corrupt the Faith by believing
of God falſe things: but Schiſmatiks by wicked diviſions breake from
fraternall Charity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they belieue what we belieue. And (Lib: 1. de
Serm: Dom: in Mon: Cap. 5.) Many Heretiks, vnder the name of Chriſtians
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving mens ſoules, do ſuffer many ſuch things: but where there is
not ſound Faith, there cannot be juſtice. Neither can Schiſmatiks
promiſe to themſelves any part of this reward (Bleſſed are they who
ſuffer perſecution for juſtice) becauſe likewiſe where there is no
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, there cannot be juſtice. The loue of our neighbour doth not worke
evill: which if they had, they would not teare in peeces the Body of Chriſt,
which is the Church.</q> Do you not ſee that this Saint ſtill oppoſes
Hereſy to Faith, and Schiſme to that Charity, which vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes the members of
Gods Church, in one myſticall Body which Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me divides? Alſo the
ſame Saint ſayes (Ep: 204.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Being out of the Church, and divided
from the heape of vnity, and the bond of Charity, thou ſhouldeſt be
puniſhed with eternall death, though thou ſhouldeſt be burned aliue for
the name of Chriſt.</q> Now if many of the members of the Church haue no
Charity, as you ſay, they muſt be Schiſmatiks; or if they be not, they
haue that Charity which Schiſmatiks want, and conſequently it is vntrue,
that they haue no Charity. Will you haue them be members of the Church,
becauſe they are not divided from her by Schiſme, and yet not be members of
the Church in regard they haue no Charity? Potter (Pag: 42.) ſaith;
<hi>Though faith be kept entire, yet if Charity be wanting, the vnity of the
Church is diſturbed, her vnton diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. Schiſme is no leſſe
damnable than Hereſy.</hi> Why do you not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt your client,
That, <hi>many members of the Church haue no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and therfore that it is
manifeſtly vntrue, that if Charity be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the vnity of the Church is
diſturbed, her vnion diſſolved,</hi> ſeing, men may be members of the
Church, though they want all Charity, and conſequently, if Charity be
wanting, it is not neceſſary that the vnion of the Church muſt be
diſſolved? Or if you grant to Potter, that Charity is the cauſe that the
<hi>vnity of the Church is</hi> not <hi>diſturbed, and Her vnion</hi> not
<hi>diſſolved,</hi> what is this but to ſay with <hi>Charity
Maintayned;</hi> That, <hi>All the members of the viſible Church are by
Charity vnited in one mysticall Body?</hi> Why is Her vnion diſſolved, if
Charity be wanting, but becauſe by Charity it is conſerved? You ſay (Pag:
273. N. 56.) That <hi>if we ſuppoſe a viſible Church extant before, and
when Luther aroſe <pb n="527" facs="tcp:59214:274"/>conformable to him in all Points of
Doctrine, neceſſary and profitable, then Luther ſeparated not from this
Church, but adjoined himſelfe to it: Not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in place, which was not
neceſſary, not in externall Communion, which was impoſſible, but by the
vnion of Faith and Charity.</hi> If one ſhould aske; how do you know that
Luther had Charity; or whether he might not haue been a member of that imagined
Church, though he had been in deadly ſin? what would you anſwer? ſure I
am, whatſoever you anſwer for Potter, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yourſelfe, will confute your
objection againſt <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned,</hi> and ſhew how familiar
Contradictions are with you; as in our preſent caſe you muſt either grant
that Luther, if he chanced to be in deadly ſin, could not vnite himſelfe to
that imaginary Church, or els that Charity is not neceſſary to conſtitute
one a member of a Church; and conſequently, that one may be a member of the
Church, and free from the ſin of Schiſme, though he want that Charity,
which is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with deadly ſin, and inſeparable from juſtifying
Grace, vpon condition, that he be innocent of that vice againſt Charity,
which we call Schiſme, and puts a man ſo farr out of Charity with the
Church, or with his neighbour, as a member of the Church, as not to
communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him in Sacraments, Liturgy, and publike Worſhip of God.
Neither is there any neceſſity, that whoſoever offends againſt a
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for example, Charity, muſt offend in all Exceſſes or Defects, or
other offenſes, that may be committed againſt it. To be a good Man, a good
Citizen, a good Magiſtrate, are conſiderations very different, and
ſeparable one from another: And therfore <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Chap:
5. N. 3.) told you, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that our neighbour may be conſidered,
either as one private perſon hath a ſingle relation to an other, or as all
concurre to make one company or congregation, which we call the Church:</q> And
who ſees not, that a man who is in ſtate of deadly ſin, and therfore
loves not God aboue all things, may loue his neighbour in ſuch a degree, as
not to wiſh or procure his death; as alſo one may want Charity to an other,
as a private perſon, without ſeparating from him as a member of one Church,
in which they agree a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d communicate.</p>
               <p n="99">99. Object: 6. (Pag: 255. N. 5.) You cite the words of

words cited in the beginning of your Objection. And therfore, ſeing he doth
not express, whether they muſt be faithfull by true internall Faith, or only
by externall profeſſion of the true Faith, but his words being generall,
they are certainly true in all opinions; to witt, that Faith is required to
make one a member of the Church, not determining, whether that Faith muſt be
internall, or whether an outward profeſſion be ſufficient to that effect.
Sure I am this is no faithfull dealing in you.</p>

May not our neighbour be conſidered, either as he is a private perſon, or

               <p n="103">103. Object: 8. <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1
Pag: 154 N. 4.) ſaith: <hi>The Catholique Church ſignifyes one
Congregation, or Community of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people, and therfore implyes not only
Faith, to make them faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but alſo Communion, or common
vnion, to make them one in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which excludes ſeparation and
Diviſion.</hi> Which words ſignify, that all the members of the Catholique
Church muſt be vnited in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that they be not voluntarily
divided one from another in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, againſt Charity, as we haue declared
both out of Catholique, and Proteſtant Divines. You, (Pag: 255. N. 9.) cite
him thus: <hi>All the members of the Catholique Church muſt of neceſſity
be vnited in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Communion:</hi> Which, ſay you, <hi>certainly cannot
be perpetually true. For, a man vnjuſtly excommunicated, is not in the
Churches Communion, yet he is ſtill a member of the Church: And diverſe
tymes it hath happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that particular men, and particular Churches, haue
vpon an overva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued difference; either renounced Communion multually, or one

               </p>
               <p n="104">104. Anſwer. I haue declared aboue, the difference
between ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Church by excommunication, even when it is
valid, and juſt, and Diviſion from it by Schiſme. But if the
Excommunication be vnjuſt and invalide, the party cenſured remaynes ſtill
a member of the Church, and partakes of all common ſuffrages, being really in
her Communion, though he may be obliged to abſtaine from ſome actions in
foro externo and to be haue himſelfe, as if he were truly excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated.
But Schiſme is a voluntary diſobedience a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſeparation from the Communion
of the Church againſt Charity. Separation by excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is voluntary
only in cauſa, in the ſinne for which it is impoſed: Diviſion by
Schiſme is voluntary in itſelfe, as being the very Diviſion 
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:59214:275"/>itſelfe from the externall Communion of the Church. You
ſpeake very confuſedly in ſaying, That, <hi>particular men, and
particular Churches either renounced Communion mutually, or one of them
ſeparated from the other, and yet both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> continued members of the
Catholique Church.</hi> If you meane only a verball ſeparation, as I may
tearme it, wherby one ſaith, or threatens, that he will haue nothing to doe
with the other, you do but trifle, if afterward no effect follow vpon ſuch
threates, or words. For in that caſe we may ſay Proteſtatio contra facta
nihil valet. But if really one part ſeparate from the other in Sacraments,
Liturgy, publike prayers and worſhip of God; then, for preventing further
inconvenience, or a Schiſme among faithfull people, the ſupreme Paſtour
vicar of Chriſt, and Succeſſour to S. Peter, muſt interpoſe his
Authority, giue Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and command the erring party to ſubmit; which if
he refuſe to do, he will grow to be divided not only from the particular
Church which he oppoſed, but from the vniverſall Church, whoſe Paſtour
he ſtubbornly diſobeyes, and ſo becomes a formall Schiſmatike. For
which cauſe <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (N. 5.) ſaied; The <hi>guilt of
Schiſme may be contracted not only by diviſion from the vniuerſall
Church, but alſo by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from a particular Church, or Diocess,
which agrees with the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall.</hi> Put caſe twoe particular
dioceſſes or Churches refuſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate one with an other, when
occaſion offers it ſelfe, thoſe twoe are neither members one of another,
nor agree in externall Communion; yet they may agree with the Vniverſall
Church, and ſoe agreeing in a third, come to be vnited amongſt
themſelves. One parte of a community is not a member of another part, but of
the whole Body, with which it is ſuppoſed to communicate, and ſo you will
find, that to be a member of a Community, and to participate in externall
Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the ſame, do goe pari paſſu; and that therfore your
Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection had no force, except to proue, as indeed it doth, the neceſſity
of a living Judge in Gods Church to prevent Schiſmes, and command Vnion, and
to giue vs a Rule to judg, what true Schiſme is, and when it happens: For
which cauſe S. Hierom (Lib: 1. contra Jovin:) affirmes that S. Peter was
choſen to be Head of the Church, to take away occaſion of Schiſme, Inter

<q rend="margQuotes">vnus eligitur, vt capite conſtituto

               <p n="106">106. Anſwer. It is a ſhrewd ſigne, you want better
matter, who object ſuch triffles. Firſt; though we ſhould ſuppoſe
<hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> to haue ſayd, every Heretike is a Schiſmatike;
and that <hi>Mr. Chillingworth</hi> ſaith the ſame, as indeed he doth (Pag:
339. N. 20.) in theſe words; <hi>Heretiks, I confeſſe do alwayes
ſeparate from the Viſible Church;</hi> Either you muſt abſolue
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> from your owne accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, or elſe condemne
yourſelfe, and anſwer your owne Argument. For, if every Heretike do alwayes
ſeparate from the Viſible Church, every Heretike muſt be a Schiſmatike.
But yet, Secondly; <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in the place you cite, affirmes
nothing of his owne, but only alledges S. Thomas (22. Queſt 39. Ar. 1 ad 3.)
And therfore you cannot blame him if he cite that Saint aright, as I am
certaine he doth; for I haue the Booke vnder my eyes at this preſent, and
find the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be very punctuall. Neither is your objection of any force
againſt S. Thomas. For, whoſoever denyes or doubts of any Point defined by
the Church (as you will ſay the ſame of any Point evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in
Scripture) and profeſſes exteriourly ſuch his errour, ceaſes to be a
member of the Viſible Church, and of our Communion, not only in Faith, but
alſo in Sacraments, and Liturgy, from which he is excluded, by ſuch a
profeſſion, as I proved aboue, that perſons of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Faith cannot
communicate in the publike worſhip of God. Beſides, Excommunication
inflicted vpon every Heretike, divides him from the Church, by a particular new
title. If you ſuppoſe his Hereſy to be meerly internall; as it is
incompletly Hereſy, in order to a Viſible Church, of which we ſpeake;
ſo alſo inchoatiuè, it excludes him from externall Communion, that
is, it deprives him in the ſight of God, of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to communicate in
Sacraments, and if he approach to them, it is to his owne da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation; and if the
Church could judge de occultis, he might be expelled from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: In the meane
tyme he does as a theefe, making vſe of ſtolne goods; and ſo ſtill
there runs ſuch a proportion between Hereſy and Schiſme, as that every
heretike is a Schiſmatike, completely, or incompletely, perfectly, or
inchoatiuè, according to the degree of his being an Heretike.</p>
               <p n="107">107. Object: 10. (Pag: 274. N. 56.) you ſay:
<hi>Though the whole Church were corrupted, yet properly ſpeaking, it is not
true, that Luther and his followers forſooke the whole corrupted Church, or
the externall Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <pb n="532" facs="tcp:59214:276"/>of it: but only that he
forſooke that part of it which was corrupted, and ſtill would be ſo, and
forſooke not, but only reformed another Part, which Part they themſelves
were, and I ſuppoſe you will not go about to perſwade vs, that they
foorſooke themſelves or their owne Communion. And if you vrge, that they
themſelves joyned to no other Part, therfore they ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the
whole: I ſay it followes not, in as much as themſelves were a part of it,
and ſtill continued ſo: and therfore could no more ſeparate from the
whole, than from themſelves. Thus, though there were no part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Rome to whom the plebeians joyned themſelves, when they made their
ſecesſion into the Auentine Hill, yet they divided themſelves from the
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritians only, and not from the whole people, becauſe themſelves were a
part of this people, and they divided not from themſelves.</hi> The like
evaſion you haue (Pag: 295. N. 94.)</p>
               <p n="108">108. Anſwer. How many ſhifts to decline a true
confeſſion? Firſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants had cauſe to ſeparate. 2. they are

Sects of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts muſt ſeparate from one another, no less than from
vs, which ſequele you deny. 3. They did not ſeparate from the Church,
though they did ſeparate from the externall Communion of all Churches. 4.
They ſeparated not from the whole Church, becauſe they ſeparated not from
themſelves. Of the former evaſions we haue ſpoken already. This laſt is
not hard to be confuted.</p>
               <p n="109">109. Firſt, it contradicts yourſelfe. For (Pag: 273.
N. 55.) you ſay <hi>As for the externall Communion of the viſible Church,
we haue without ſcruple formerly granted, that, Proteſtants did forſake
it, that is, renounce the practiſe of ſome obſervances, in which the
whole viſible Church before them did communicate.</hi> Now, if the whole
viſible Church did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in corruptions, or was corrupted; by leaving
thoſe who were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, they left all, or the whole Church, for thoſe
corruptions, which according to Proteſtants, happening de facto to be in the
Liturgy, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike worſhip of God, vſe of Sacraments, and the like, in which
exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall communion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts they left the externall communion of the
viſible Church, as we haue heard you grant in your owne words now cited.</p>
               <p n="110">110. Secondly: This evaſion is but a begging of the
Queſtion, while you ſuppoſe, they who divided themſelves from the
reſt, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a Part of the Church, to the vnion and Communion wherof,
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Communion is eſſentiall, and therfore that being altered, it is
impoſſible, that it remaynes the ſame Church, in order to all Parts, or 
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:59214:277"/>that the dividers continue to be a Part of that former
Church, but they become a whole Schiſmaticall conventicle, of their owne.
Your errour proceeds, from not diſtinguiſhing between being a man, and
being a member of the Church, as I declared hertofore. Suppoſe Luther and his
followers, had denyed ſome Fundamentall Point of Faith, they had, even in
your opinion, ceaſed to be a Part of the Church, but not of the Community of
men, who before their ſeparation, were alſo mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church; as
Pagans, Turkes, Jewes &amp;c: may be Parts of one Commonwealth, but not of one
Church: Therfore it is one thing to remayne a Part of a Community of men, and
another to be ſtill a Part of Gods Church, whatſoever that Church be
ſuppoſed to be, whether Roman, or any other. For, this principle, That
agreement in externall Communion is neceſſary to make men members of the
ſame Church, is vniverſally true. Wherby is confuted your example of the
Roman Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians: who, if they did ſeparate from the reſt, not only
materially, in place, or the like, but alſo formally, in the Lawes,
cuſtomes, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they remained not Parts of the former
Commonwealth, for as much as belonged to them; ſeing they wholy divided
themſelves, erecting a new Community, or Commonwealth, of their owne; though
ſtill they be Parts of the whole member of men, conſiſting of
Patriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Plebeians, as you call them, which is the thing affirmed by
vs; namely, that Luther and his fellowes ceaſed to be a Part of the former
Church, and erected a new whole Community of their owne; and ſo your Argument
comes to be retorted againſt yourſelfe.</p>
               <p n="111">111. Thirdly. Wheras you ſuppoſe, that we will not
go about to perſwade you, that Luther and his followers forſooke
themſelves, or their owne Communion: I anſwer; I haue ſmall hope to
perſwade you any truth, that may ſeeme to favour vs Catholiks; And, for
others, I need not perſwade them, to belieue that, which is evident of
itſelfe; namely that you will needs remaine in a perpetuall equivocation, not
diſtinguiſhing, between being a man, and being a member of the Church, or
between ſubſtance and accidents, or between the ſame man, conſidered
phiſically, and morally: Which even in your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is cleare in one,
who falls into any errour repugnant to ſome Fundamentall Article, and ſo
inſtantly ceaſes to be a member of the Church, as he was before, and in
that reſpect, is morally divided from himſelfe, as much as, eſt, and non
eſt, are oppoſite. If of the ſame reall common ſubject not deſtroyed,
for example, of Socrates, we could <pb n="534" facs="tcp:59214:277"/>ſay, exiſtit &amp;
non exiſtit, though for different tymes, we might truly ſay, that he were
phyſically and really divided from himſelfe: Now, the ſame ſubject is
really capable of being and not being a member of the Church
ſucceſſively: Therfore we may ſay, he is divided from himſelfe, and
from his owne Communion. For, as S. Ambroſe ſaith moſt elegantly (Lib: 7.
in Cap: 15. Lucae,) of the prodigall Child: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Peregrè profectus eſt in
regionem longinquam. Quid long inquius eſt, quàm a ſe recedere; nec

becomes a member only of the world, both as the world is taken for wicked men,
divided from Chriſt, or as it ſignifyes the number of all men, as men; of
which a Schiſmatike remaines a part, though not a part of the Church, as hath
beene ſayd.</p>
               <p n="112">112. Beſides: in the Opinion of thoſe Calviniſts
who teach that the whole Church could, and did periſh (which is a damnable
hereſy, yet for explicating the nature of things, we may for the preſent
ſuppoſe it, ad hominem) they who firſt ſeparated themſelves from the
primitiue pure Church, and brought in corruptions in Faith, Practiſe,
Liturgy, and vſe of Sacraments, may truly be ſayd to haue beene Heretiks,
by departing from the pure Faith; and Schiſmatiks, by dividing themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
from the externall Communion, of the true vncorrupted Church, though it be
ſuppoſed to be deſtroyed: therfore one may depart from his owne Faith,
and remaine no more a part of that Body of which he was once a member, whether
we ſuppoſe, that former Myſticall Body to be ſtill exiſtent, or to
haue periſhed: which conſideration of exiſting, or not exiſting of the
Community from which one departs, is only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, and accidentall to
Schiſme conſiſting formally in diviſion from the Communion of the
Church, whether only preexiſtent, or exiſtent alſo for the preſent. If
it be ſayd (Geneſ: 1. V. 5.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Diviſit Lucem a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebris, he divided
the light from the darkness,</q> by taking away, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically or, as I may
ſay, deſtroying one of the extremes (ſeing light, and 
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:59214:278"/>darkness cannot ſtand together) much more may we ſay,
that morally one may be divided from a Church, and from himſelfe, though that
Church ceaſe to be, or ſtill remayne; and he ſhall ceaſe to be a member
of it, even by that Diviſion, though he ceaſe nor to exiſt, or be a man,
or himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="113">113. And now appeares, that, what <hi>Charity

<q rend="margQuotes">(ad Titum 3. A man that is an Heretike,

none can go forth of the Church, becauſe they cannot go from themſelves. S.
Fulgentius, cited N. 7. ſaith (de Fid: ad Pet:) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Belieue this ſtedfaſtly without

he ſhould ſhed his bloud for the Name of Chriſt, he cannot obtaine
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</q> But how can any be reconciled to the Catholique Church, if he
cannot be divided from her, Becauſe he neither was, nor could be divided from
himſelfe? And that you may be convinced by all kind of witneſſes, how
could Calvin ſay, (Epiſt: 141.) <hi>we were forced to make a ſeparation
from the whole world;</hi> ſince he could not ſeparate from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? We
muſt therfore ſay, that, whoſoever divides himſelfe from the Church by
Schiſme, ſeparates from the whole Church, becauſe by that ſeparation,
he ceaſeth to be a member of the Church, and ſo the Church, which before
was a Whole, of which he then was a Part, remaines in Herſelfe, a Whole, but
he no Part, by reaſon of his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Diviſion from Her; which, for the
effect of his being, or not being, denominated a Part of the Church, is all one
with corporall death: vnleſſe you will covertly haue men belieue; that
there can be no ſuch imaginable thing, as Schiſme from the whole, or
vniverſall Church, becauſe the party ſeparating himſelf from the
Church, is ſtill a Part of Her, in regard he is not divided from himſelfe.
And no wonder, if you make ſmall account of Schiſme, or Diviſion from the
Church, who think, and ſpeak, ſo contemptibly of the Church, as we haue
heard you (Pag: 294. N. 93.) ſpeak even of the Catholique Church, in theſe

and how they made a ſeparation from the whole world; nor how they could ſay
ſo, ſeing ſo many millions followed them. But I beſeech you
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that even Luther himſelfe for his owne opinions, and
apoſtaſy, proceeded by degrees, ſo farr, as that he pretended to
ſubmitt himſelfe to the Pope. And then, how could ſo many follow him, at

And ſeing in thoſe doubts, and doctrines, ſome tyme muſt paſſe,

true, even of thoſe who afterward were ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <pb n="538" facs="tcp:59214:279"/>by

to All, and All oppoſed themſelves to him, as appeares by that which he

<hi>It is one thing to ſeparate from the Communion of the whole world,

apud multos, among many, as Tertullian ſpeakes, but, apud omnes, among all

pernicious conſequence, while you ſay <hi>(that Chriſtians and Catholikes

               <p n="119">119. But this is not all. For, when S. Auſtine

<q rend="margQuotes">It is not poſſible, that any man

accidentall vnity in Communion, which might be altered, and which you ſay de

and more vniverſall, and ſtable Ground, that God hath obliged himſelfe,
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to permitt, the Gates of Hell to privaile againſt his Church, in
ſuch manner, as men not only might, but alſo ſhould be obliged, to
forſake her Communion: Otherwiſe S. Auſtines Argument had beene of no
force, and only a Petitio principii, as being grounded vpon a Point, which was
the thing in Controverſy, between Catholikes, and Donatiſts, that is,
(whether the Church at that tyme was corrupted) and therfore S. Auſtine, and
other Fathers, did rely vpon an vniverſall, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d conſtant ground, as I
alſo obſerved, when I ſpoke of ſucceſſion of Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops. And the
words of S. Auſtine can ſignify no less. For, he ſaith not, There is not
any juſt cauſe, to ſeparate from the Communion of the whole world, as if
he ſpoke only of ſome preſent ſtate and condition, or ſome
accidentall, and changeable thing, but he ſaith abſolutely: 
<q rend="margQuotes">It is not poſſible that any may
haue juſt cauſe to ſeparate their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from the Communion of the

poſſible, that the Church of the whole world, could fall into any errour,
or corruption; and that Luther was a Schiſmatike, for leaving Her Communion,
vpon a pretence, ſo falſe, and injurious, to God and his Church. Morover,
this your anſwer doth vndoubtedly croſſe your owne conſcience. For you
do not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that there were many errours in the Church of S.
Auſtires tyme, as the beliefe of the B. Trinity, the Conſubſtantiality of
the Son with his Father &amp;c: but you alſo affirme againe and againe, that
S. Auſtine himſelfe, and the whole Church with him, held a great errour,
about <pb n="541" facs="tcp:59214:281"/>the neceſſity of the Euchariſt for children,
wherin though you do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciouſly erre, and wrong that Holy Father; yet in
your judgment, the Donatiſts could not be truly convinced of Schiſme, for
leaving that Church, which you hold, to haue beene in an errour againſt
Faith, in a Point of very great moment: Or if the Donatiſts could not
ſeparate from the Church of that tyme, though corrupted, what excuſe could
Luther haue, for his Diviſion, from all Churches, of the whole world, vpon
pretence of errours?</p>

periſhed, by reaſon that Catholikes did communicate with ſome men, who,
as they falſely ſayd, were guilty of great crimes: and if they held the
Church to haue periſhed, how can you ſay, that they pretended no cauſe
for their ſeparation? Nay, how could they chuſe but alledge for their
excuſe, a moſt convincing and neceſſary cauſe (if it had been true)
the totall ruine, and deſtruction, of the Church; with which therfore it was
wholy impoſſible, for them to communicate? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be denyed, but
that they calumniated Catholikes, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with Caecilianus, whom
they falſly accuſed of partaking with them, who were called Traditors of
the holy Bible to be burnt, though indeed not Caecilianus, but they

publiſhed your Booke, write, that ſetting pictures in Churches, and vpon

ſay, when pictures began to appeare in Engliſh Proteſtant Churches, even
in the vniverſityes: and ſtill I haue freſh <pb n="543" facs="tcp:59214:282"/>occaſions of wondering that ever your Booke could be approved. Do
not Lutherans to this day, ſet vp Images in their Churches? The

Images; yea and ſome defend even the worſhipping of them, as may be ſeene
in the Triple Cord, (Chapt: 17. Sect: 4.) as alſo, learned Proteſtants
confeſſe, that diverſe Fathers defended the vſe and worſhip of

about to ſacrifice his Son. Now I beſeech you tell me, whether vſe of
Images in Churches, be a ſufficient cauſe of a Diviſion from the Church,
or no? If it be, then the Donatiſts might haue reaſon to depart from the
Church, ſeing pictures were ſet vp both in, and before S. Auſtines tyme,

Donatiſts (that Catholikes ſet Pictures vpon the Altar) anſwered only, by
denying that to be true which they objected, as if they might haue beene
excuſed from Schiſme, if indeed Pictures had beene ſet vpon the Altar?
And muſt Proteſtants, depart from the Communion, of all thoſe their
Brethren, who at this day defend the lawfullness, and practiſe the ſetting

impoſſible, one can be a friend to that holy Doctour of Gods Church, and an
enemy to the Church of Rome. A conſideration of great comfort, that we defend

before all other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers.</p>
               <p n="124">124. Object: 13. <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1.
Chap 3. N. 20. Pag: 107.) proves, That, ſeing Proteſtants grant, that the
Church cannot erre in Points neceſſary to ſalvation, 
<q rend="margQuotes">any wiſe man will inferr, that it
behooves all, who haue care of their ſoules, not to forſake her in any one
Point.</q> Firſt becauſe though ſhe were ſuppoſed to erre, yet the
errour could not be Fundamentall, nor deſtructiue of Faith, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Neither can they be accuſed of any leaſt imprudence in erring (if it were
poſſible) with the vniverſall Church. 2. Since ſhe is, vnder paine of
eternall damnation, to be believed in ſome things, wherin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſedly
ſhe is indued with infallibility; I cannot in wiſdome ſuſpect her
credit in matters of less moment. 3. Since we are obliged, not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Church in Fundamentall Points, and that there is no Rule to know
preciſely, what, and how many thoſe Fundamentall Points be, I cannot
without hazard of my ſoule, leaue her in any one Point; leaſt perhaps that
Proue to be Fundamentall, and neceſſary to ſalvation. 4. That Viſible
Church, even that Church, which confeſſedly cannot erre in Points
Fundamentall, doth without diſtinction, propound all her deſinitions
concerning matters of Faith, to be believed vnder Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themas, or Curſes,
holding it as a Point neceſſary to ſalvation, that we belieue ſhe
cannot erre: wherin if ſhe ſpeake true, then to deny any one Point in
particular, which ſhe defineth, or to affirme in generall, that ſhe may
erre, puts a man in ſtate of damnation: wheras to belieue her in ſch Points
as are not neceſſary to ſalvation, cannot endanger our ſalvation; as
likwiſe to remayne in her communion, can bring no great harme, becauſe
ſhe cannot maintayne any damnable errour, or practiſe; but to be divided
from her (ſhe being Chriſts Catholique Church) is moſt certainly
damnable. 5. The true Church, being in lawfull, and certaine poſſeſſion
of Superiority, and Power to command, and require obedience, from all
Chriſtians in ſome things; I cannot without grievous ſin, withdraw my
obedience in any one, vnless I know evidently, that the thing commanded, comes
not within the compaſſe of thoſe things, to which her Power extendeth.
And who <pb n="546" facs="tcp:59214:283"/>can better informe me, how far Gods Church can
proceed, then Gods Church herſelfe? Or to what Doctour can the children, and
Schollers with greater reaſon, and ſecurity, fly for direction, than to the
Mother and appointed Teacher of all Chriſtians? In following her, I ſhall
ſooner be excuſed, than in cleaving to any particular Sect, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or applying Scriptures, againſt Her Doctrine, or interpretation. 6. The
fearfull examples of innumerable Perſons, who forſaking the Church vpon
pretence of her errours, haue fayled, even in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Points, and
ſuffered ſhipwrack of their ſalvation, ought to deterr all Chriſtians
from oppoſing her in any Doctrine, or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: As (to omit other both
ancient and moderne hereſyes) we ſee, that divers chiefe Proteſtants,
pretending to reforme the corruptions of the Church, are come to affirme, that
for many Ages, ſhee er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to death, and wholy periſhed; which Dr. Potter
cannot deny to be a Fundamentall errour, againſt that Article of our Creed, I
belieue the Catholike Church, as he affirmeth it of the Donatiſts, becauſe
they confined the vniverſall Church, within Africa, or ſome other ſmall
tract of ſoile; Leaſt therfore I may fall into ſome Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall errour,
it is moſt ſafe for me, to believe all the decrees of the Church, which
cannot erre Fundamentally; eſpecially if we add; that, according to the
Doctrine of Catholique Divines, One er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in Faith, whether it be for the
matter itſelfe, great, or ſmall, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyes Faith; and conſequently to
accuſe the Church of any one errour, is to affirme, that ſhe loſt all
Faith; and erred damnably: which very ſaying is damnable, becauſe it leaves
Chriſt no Viſible Church on earth.</p>
               <p n="125">125. Theſe are the reaſons of <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> in the ſayd (N. 20.) which I wiſh you had ſet downe, as
you found them; that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might haue judged, how much they ought to

               <p n="126">126. Your chiefeſt, and, as I may call it,
Fundamentall Anſwer; is, That I begg the Queſtion, in ſuppoſing that
any Church of one denomination is infallible in Fundamentall Points, and that
Proteſtants, when they ſay the Church is infallible in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Points, vnderſtand only, <hi>That there ſhall be alwayes a Church, to the

                  <pb n="547" facs="tcp:59214:284"/>But I haue ſhewed hertofore, that you wrong even your
pretended Brethren the Proteſtants, in faſtening on them, ſo ridiculous
an interpretation of the Churches infallibility in Fundamentall Points; and
therfore I muſt ſtill inſiſt vppon that ground, in the ſenſe which
Proteſtants grant, and which I haue proved to be true. Which truth being
ſuppoſed, yourſelfe are forced to favour vs, ſo farr, as to ſay (Pag:
163. N. 55.) <hi>We never annexed this Priviledge</hi> (of not erring in
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls) <hi>to any one Church of any one Denomination, as the Greeke or

Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtians, diſtinguiſhable from all others by adhering to
ſuch a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop for our guide in Fundamentalls, then indeed, and then only,
might you with ſome colour, though with no certainty haue concluded, that we
could not in wiſdome, forſake this Church in any Point, for feare of
forſaking it in a neceſſary Point.</hi> And in the next (N. 56.) you
ſay; <hi>Firſt we confeſſe no ſuch thing, thas the Church of Rome was
then this Church,</hi> (vnerring in Fundamentalls when Luther aroſe) <hi>but
only a Part of it. Secondly, that if by adhering to the Church, we could haue
beene thus far ſecured, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t had ſome ſhew of Reaſon.</hi>
And (P: 150. N. 39.) <hi>If the Church were an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble director in
Fundamentall: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt we not only learne Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>talls of her, but alſo
learne of her, what is Fundamentall, and take all for Fundamentall, which ſhe
delivers to be ſuch. In the performance wherof, if I knew any one Church to
he Infallible, I would quickly be of that Church.</hi> Eternally be Gods
Infinite Goodness bleſſed, who hath made vs Catholikes members of that
infallible Church! But in the meane tyme, you grant as much, as will ſerue,
to overthrow all your owne Arguments, in granting that if the Church be
infallible in Fundamentall Points, we haue all reaſon not to forſake Her:
And you giue that very Reaſon which is alledged by <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> to wit, <hi>for feare of forſaking it in a neceſſary
point;</hi> ſo that you make good both his Aſſertion, and reaſon
therof; and further you are ready to ſeale your Doctrine with your
practiſe, by being quickly of that Church. Heere I beſeech you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
your owne words (Pag: 280. N. 95.) <hi>May not a man of judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in
the Communion of a Church confeſſedly corrupted, as well as in a Church
ſuppoſed to be corrupted?</hi> And then; ſuppoſe ſuch a Church
ſhould erre in Points not Fundamentall, what would you doe? The ſame
reaſon (of not erring in Fundamentalls) for which you would quickly joyne
yourſelfe to her, would alſo oblige you nor to forſake her; and then you
muſt find ſome Anſwer to all thoſe Objections, which you make againſt
the Reaſons of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> alledged <pb n="548" facs="tcp:59214:284"/>by
him to proue, that if once I belieue the Church to be infallible in
Fundamentalls, I cannot in wiſdome forſake her in any Point, or parte from
her Communion. If you thinke it impoſſible, not to ſorſake her
Communion, in caſe ſhe fall into Errours not fundamentall, and yet belieue
that you muſt not forſake her, (which is a plain Contradiction) there
remaines only this true, and ſolid remedy, againſt ſuch an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable
perplexity; that you belieue her to be infallible in all Points, be they
Fundamentall, or not Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall; which is a certaine Truth, and followes from
the very Principles of Proteſtants, (that the Church cannot erre in
Fundamentalls) if they vnderſtand themſelves, though you be loath to grant
this ſo neceſſary a Truth. Yea my inference (that you muſt belieue the
Church to be infallible in all Points, even not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, if you belieue
her to be infallible in Fundamentalls,) is your owne Aſſertion (P. 148. N.
36.) Where you expreſſly grant, that, <hi>vnless the Church were infallible
in all things, we could not rationally belieue her for her owne ſake, and
vpon her owne word and Authority in any thing. For, an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſubject to
errour, can be no firme or ſtable foundation of my beliefe in any thing: And
if it were in any thing, then this Authority being one and the ſame in all
propoſalls, I ſhould haue the ſame reaſon to belieue all, that I haue
to belieue one; and therfore muſt either do vnreaſonably, in believing any
one thing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſole warrant of this Authority, or vnreaſonably, in not

This Advertiſment premiſed.</p>
               <p n="130">130. I anſwer to your demand (whether it had not been
a damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſin to profess errours, though in themſelves not damnable?)
that a parte rei, and per ſe loquendo, it is damnable to profess any leaſt
knowne errour againſt Faith: and for that very cauſe, it is impoſſible
the Church ſhould fall into any errour at all: But that I haue proved
already, that according to the Groundes and words of Proteſtants, it is not
damnable to do ſo, if the errour be nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to ſome Fundamentall
Truth; and conſequently, that they ought in all Reaſon, to adhere to the
Church, acknowledged to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in Fundamentall Points, rather than
forſake her communion, for Points not neceſſary to ſalvation;
eſpecially with danger of forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her in ſome neceſſary Point. Or
if you ſay; It is Fundamentall to the Faith of a Chriſtian to belieue
whatſoever is ſufficiently propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as revealed by God, as Dr. Potter
grants, and the thingh it ſelfe is evidently true; then you muſt either
affirme, that the Church did not erre in any Point of Faith, or els that ſhe
erred Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, and ceaſed to be a Church, which is againſt your
preſent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and againſt Potter, who (P. 126.) teaches that to
ſay the church <hi>remayned only in the part of Donatus, was an errour in the
matter and nature of it properly hereticall.</hi> And much worſe muſt it
be, to ſay, ſhe remayned <pb n="551" facs="tcp:59214:286"/>no where; and ſo while you
pretend to fly the fained errours of the Church, you fall into a formall and
proper hereſy.</p>
               <p n="131">131. If we conſider what may be inferred, not
abſolutely, but vpon ſome impoſſible ſuppoſition; That the Church
erres in Points of Faith not Fundamentall; we muſt inferr, that ſhe may be
forſaken, becauſe ſhe erres in matters of Faith; and yet may not be
forſaken, becauſe as we have ſeene out of the Holy Fathers, it is never
lawfull to forſake the Church. What then is to be concluded, but that (as I
haue ſayd hertofore) ſhe cannot erre, and therfore cannot be forſaken
vpon any termes? Divines teach, that at leaſt per ſe loquendo, non poteſt
dari perplexitas, that is, there cannot happen a caſe wherin a man,
what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth, is ſure to commit ſome ſinfull thing, (becauſe
it is a firſt principle in nature, that nothing is is more in our freedome,
than to ſin, or not to ſin.) And yet this cauſe of perplexity muſt
perpetually happen; if the Church could erre, that is, one muſt judge that
ſhe we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to be forſaken, and not to be forſaken, and ſo remaine
miſerably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed. We muſt therefore, for avoyding this abſurdity,
conclude, that the Church cannot erre in any matter of Faith.</p>
               <p n="132">132. But yet (to come to the laſt part of my
Advertiſement) If we perſiſt in the ſuppoſition; That one is
perſwaded, the Church doth erre, muſt he therfore forſake her communion,
as Luther and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes did? In no caſe. For then we muſt call to mynd,
the Doctrine of Divines, in caſe of perplexity: that if one be in a vincible,
or cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable errour, for one of the contradictory parts, it is in his power,
and he is obliged, to depoſe that errour; which if he do not, he ſhall not
be excuſed from ſin, notwithſtanding his perplexity, and ſeeming
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of a neceſſity to ſin whatſoever he does. If we ſuppoſe
his errour to be invincible; for example, he beleeves the Church may not in any
caſe be forſaken, and yet that ſhe erres, and that he ſhould ſin, in
pro-, feſſing thoſe ſuppoſed errours; this ſuppoſition, I ſay,
being once made (I diſpute not whether ſuch a perplexity be poſſible in
this particular matter, or no) then enters the Doctrine of all Divines, that he
is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to embrace the leſſer evill, and to follow the generall Axiome,
ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duobus malis, minus eſt eligendum: as we ſee, nature expoſes the arme
to defend the head: And in dubijs pars tutior eſt eligenda. And therfore your
ſaying (Pag: 283. N. 72.) <hi>We muſt not do evill to avoide evill,</hi>
taken vniverſally, and in all caſes, is manifeſtly falſe, againſt the
light of Reaſon; and your allegation of Scripture (Pag: 168. N. 63.) 
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:59214:286"/>you muſt not do evill that good may come theron, is not
to the purpoſe. For, we ſpeake not of attaining, a voluntary greater good,
but of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding a greater evill, neceſſary to be committed, vnless a
leſſer evill be embraced. This then being certaine, that in caſe of
perplexity, one is obliged to embrace the leſſer evill, the Queſtion may
remaine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by doing ſo, he is excuſed from all fault, or only from
being guilty of that greater ſin, which he avoides, by chooſing the
leſſer. Certaine it is, that he committs not ſo grievous a ſin, as if
he had betaken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the other part. But diverſe great Divines, (as
Amicus: Tom: 3. D. 15. Sect: 3. N. 43. Tho: Sanch: Tom: 1. in Decalog: Cap: 11.
N. 14. &amp; alij,) are of opinion, that he commits no ſin at all; becauſe
in that caſe of invincible Perplexity, it is not in his power to avoide that
which otherwiſe were a ſin, and can be none in him, becauſe every ſinne
eſſentially requires freedome of will. He harh, ſay they, freedom to
chuſe either of thoſe two parts, taken as it were materially, or
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red per modum naturae, but not formally, and morally, ſo to chuſe
them, as to avoide ſin abſolutely, ſeing he muſt of neceſſity
chuſe one ſide; and therfore by embracing the leſſer evill, he does as
much, as lyes in his power to doe for avoiding ſin, and conſequently, is
not culpable, or blameworthy. Now according to theſe Doctrines; whoſoever
leaves the Church vpon pretence of errours not Fundamentall, cannot be
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from Schiſme, becauſe to profess ſuch errours, had been either
a leſſe ſin, than to leaue the Church, and ſo, in the opinion of all
Divines, he was obliged to embrace that less evill, and not leaue the Church;
or it had been no ſin at all, in the opinion of diverſe good Divines, and
then much less can he be excuſed for leaving the Church, without any
neceſſity at all. Yea, ſeing this laſt opinion is probable, he might
pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conforme his conſcience to it, and by that meanes free himſelfe,
from, not only ſin, but alſo from danger therof, by following a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and prudent dictamen, that to profess errours not Fundamentall, were no ſin
at all, in that caſe, and vpon that ſuppoſition, of inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
perplexity. Nay, I ſay more, that if this latter opinion of Divines be true,
a man ſhall not ſin, though he be of a contrary mynd, and thinke in his
conſcience, that he ſins by chooſing the leſſer evill, though not
ſo grievouſly, as he had done by adhering to the other part. My reaſon
is; becauſe this latter opinion, is grounded vpon the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which the perplexed perſon hath to avoide ſin, and one cannot ſin, in
doing that, which he cannot avoide, though by an erronious 
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:59214:287"/>conſcience he judge that he ſins; as if one cannot
heare Maſſe vpon a holy day; or kills a man, with a weapon violently put
into his hand, and with his hand by like violence carryed to that fact: in
thoſe, or the like caſes, no ſin is committed, though the partyes
ſhould thinke they ſin; And this is true, though that part, or less ill
which is embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, be intrinſecè malum, evill of it ſelf, or of its
nature, (which is well to be obſerved, for our caſe, of profeſſing
knowne errours, which of it ſelfe is evill) becauſe no ſin, of any kind,
can be committed, when it is impoſſible to avoid it. According to which
conſiderations, to elect the profeſſion of errours, rather then the
deſertion of the Church, is not only ſecure, but certaine, and eaſy, and
therfore neceſſary. Thus your mayne Objection is turned againſt your
ſelfe. And then it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferred; that if it either be no ſin, or at
leaſt a less offenſe, to profess errours, than to forſake the Church;
ſhe may juſtly exact, and injoyne vnder Cenſures, that, to which every
one is obliged by the Law of God, notwithſtanding any pretence or
ſuppoſition of errours. For, when the Holy Fathers, vnanimouſly agree,
that it is not poſſible, there can be any juſt cauſe to forſake the
Church, they muſt ſuppoſe, that either ſhe cannot fall into any errour,
which is moſt true, (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they ſuppoſe it; otherwiſe there could
be no difference betweene the vniverſall, and a particular Church, which may
fall into errour, and ſo be forſaken) or els you muſt grant, that they
did not conceiue any eriours could excuſe the leaving her Communion. And this
vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous conſent alone
were ſufficient for Chriſtians to belieue, that the profeſſion of
errours cannot be ſo great an evill, as ſeparation from the Church, is.
Nevertheless, reaſon it ſelfe, grounded in principles of Faith, convinceth
the ſame. For, in true Divinity, it is Fundamentall to the Faith of a
Chriſtian, not to disbelieue any one point, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propoſed as
revealed by God, as Potter expreſſly grants; and you ſay further, that it
is to giue God the ly: and therfore to profess, as a point of Faith, any thing
contrary to the beliefe of the Church, is to ſay ſhe erred fundamentally,
and fell into infidelity, as Potter ſaith, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one doth who denyes a
Divine Truth ſufficiently propoſed, and conſequently to profess, that the
Church erred, is to ſay, that ſhe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, which Potter ſaith, is, in
the matter and nature of it, properly hereticall; and ſo, Whoſoever ſaith
the Church erred, he himſelfe, by that very ſaying, profeſſes indeed a
damnable hereſy, which is worſe, than to profess an errour contrary only to
a Truth ſuppoſed to be not <pb n="554" facs="tcp:59214:287"/>Fundamentall, nor
neceſſary: and ſo by your owne confeſſions (though I grant your
confeſſions contradict yourſelf) we proue our intent.</p>
               <p n="123">123. Beſides, it is no less evident, that it is
eſſentially and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally evill, to disbelieue a truth knowne to be
witneſſed by God, than to profess externally ſome point, which one
believes not to be true: yea that firſt, muſt be the ground, for which you
ſay, it is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to profess againſt ones conſcience, an errour
repugnant to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation. For, if it be not damnable to deny interiourly
ſuch a truth, much leſſe can it be damnable to profess exteriourly only,
a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of that which one believes to be revealed by God. For, it is to be
conſidered, that we ſpeake not of any internall errour, but only of the
externall profeſſion of an errour, not Fundamentall, which alone is not
ſo great a ſinne, as internall Hereſy, nor ſo vaſt a Miſchiefe, as
the inconvenience of Schiſme is, which is deſtructiue of the whole Church,
eſſentially including communion in profeſſion of one Faith, Liturgy
&amp;c. and neceſſarily brings with it a deluge of ſcandall,
irreligioſity, contempt, diſobedience, and in one word, vniverſitatem
malorum, and therfore S. Thomas teaches (2.2. Queſt: 29. Art: 2. ad 3.) that
amongſt ſins againſt our neighbour, Schiſme is the moſt grievous:
becauſe it is againſt the ſpirituall good of the multitude or community:
and as <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> ſaith (Part: 1. Pag: 156. N. 6.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">As there is as great difference
betweene the crime of rebellion, or ſedition, and debates among pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men,
as there is inequality betwixt one man, and a whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or Common
wealth; ſo in the Church, Schiſme is as much more grievous than ſedition
in a Kingdome or Common wealth, as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good of ſoules
ſurpaſſes the Civill and politicall weale.</q> See here the ſayings of
the Holy Fathers in <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Pag: 157. N. 70.) of
the grievouſness of Schiſme. All which is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by what we ſayd even
now, that the profeſſion of an errour, in our caſe, cannot ſo much as
hurt a private perſon, who conſtituted in an invincible perplexity, doth
not ſin by embracing the less evill, in the opinion of great Divines, with
whoſe Doctrine whoſoever conformes his Conſcience, is certaine not to
ſin, whatſoever the thing be in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="134">134. Morover, it is evident both in reaſon, and by
experience, that Schiſme always brings with it, that very thing which you
pretend to be ſo very inconvenient, and damnable, that is, a profeſſion
of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, at leaſt not Fundamentall, by multiplying diverſity of Sects, 
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:59214:288"/>and opinions, as we ſee it happens among Proteſtants,

<q rend="margQuotes">(which ſome caſting of, haue
ſuffered ſhip wrack in their Faith) though Schiſme in the beginning may
in ſome ſort be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood different from hereſy, yet there is no
Schiſme which doth not faine ſome Hereſy to it ſelfe, that ſo it may
ſeeme to haue departed from the Church vpon good reaſon.</q> And is it not
worſe, both to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue and profess culpable errours, than to belieue aright,
and faile on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the outward profeſſion of that beliefe? The former makes
one a formall compleat Heretike, both in conſcience, and judgment of the
Church: the latter is indeed no Heretike, but only appeares ſo to be, neither
is he ſubject to the puniſhment of Heretiks. The former offends in two
reſpects; in the beliefe of an errour, and profeſſion of it. The latter,
only in profeſſion, which alone, as I ſaied, cannot be ſo ſinfull as
the errour of Hereſy it ſelfe; both becauſe the profeſſion is
ſinfull, only by reaſon of the errour profeſſed; as alſo, becauſe
by hereſy one doubts, or denyes ſome truth revealed by God, which is
immediatly againſt Gods ſupreme Uerity and veracity, and ſo is againſt
an Object of a Theologicall Uertue; as S. Thomas ſaith (2.2 Queſt: 39. A:

<q rend="margQuotes">Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitas eſt peccatum contra

ſayd, a culpable errour is worſe, than the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſion of an
errour. If you thinke, that ſuch an externall profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is worſe
than an internall errour, becauſe that is againſt ones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; you
are much miſtaken; it being certaine, that not every ſin of
diſſimulation, againſt ones conſcience, is greater than any other
ſin; as is cleare of it ſelfe, to every Divine, or Philoſopher: yea the
externall ſinfull profeſſion of an errour, flowes from the Hereſy

wont to procede, and therfore this is less damnable, than that, even though it
were a finne, and were not excuſed by the ſuppoſed invincible perplexity,
as we have Shewed it may be. S. Thomas (2.2. Queſt: 39. Art: 2. in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore)
teaches, that

ſin than Schiſme, yet adds this exception, It may happen that ſome

ſome <pb n="556" facs="tcp:59214:288"/>like thing.</q> If this Angelicall Doctour S.
Thomas ſay this, comparing Schiſme with true infidelity, much more may we
affirme it, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider true Schiſme on the one ſide, and on the
other, only a falſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or meere externall profeſſion of errour,
or hereſy. As for thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations of S. Thomas, they may ſeeme to be
prophecyes, if we apply them to Luther and his fellowes, in regard of the
contempt, which they ſhewed of all Prelats, and the whole Church; of the, not
only danger, but reall, and vnſpeakable miſchiefes, which their Schiſme
did bring; and of moreand greater inconveniences, than could haue been believed
or imagined, if the world did not ſee, and lament them. So as we may well

Perplexity, giue this Doctrine; that, if I muſt either committ a veniall
ſin (in a matter which of it ſelfe, and per ſe loquendo, is only veniall,
for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, an officiouſly) or expoſe my ſelfe to danger of a mortall
ſin, I am obliged to chuſe the leſſer evill (which in opinion of great
Divines, were in that caſe no ſin at all) rather than put my ſelfe in
danger of the greater evill, a deadly ſin. O into how certaine danger, doth a
Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke precipitate himſelfe, (beſide the ſin of Schiſme) of
commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting innumerable deadly ſins, and of being cauſe, that innumerable
other perſons fall into the like offences, againſt God, and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour!
And therfore men are obliged, rather to vndergoe a leſſ evill, than to make
themſelves, obnoxious, to infinitly greater miſchiefes, and rather to
profess exteriourly an errour, not diſtructiue of ſalvation, than to
forſake the Communion of Gods Church, within which, God hath confined
Remiſſion of ſins, and Salvation. Conſider what we haue cited out of

(N. 55.) <hi>We never annexed this Priviledge</hi> (of not erring in
Fundamentalls) <hi>to any one Church of any one denomination: Which if we had
done, and ſet vp ſome ſetled certain ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtians for our
Guide in Fundamentalls, then indeed, and then only, might you with ſome
colour, though with no certainty, haue conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that we could not in

neceſſary Point.</hi> In theſe words you grant, that if any Church of one
denomination, were knowne to be infallible in all Fundamentall Points, we might

objections to the contrary may be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which I pray you doe; and tell
vs whether in that caſe it ſhould be damnable to profess any knowne errour?
If it be damnable; then you muſt forſake the Church in ſuch Points; which
yet you ſay, in wiſdome one could not doe: If it ſhould not be damnable;
you muſt ſhew how it was not ſo: and whatſoever you alledge for the

determinate Churches infallibility in Fundamentalls) to conclude, that we could
not in wiſdome forſake ſuch a Church in any Point, for, feare of
forſaking her in a neceſſary Point. From which confeſſion I inferr;
firſt that if in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome one ought not forſake in any Point a Church
infallible in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, for feare of forſaking her in a neceſſary
Point, much more they ought to conforme themſelves to her in externall

communion, than to profess externally ſome vnfundamentall errour; and,
Secondly that for feare of incurring a greater evill, that is (in our caſe) a
Fundamentall errour, one may and ought to chuſe the less; which is the thing
I haue endeavoured to proue, and which vtterly evacuates the ground for which
you pretend to excuſe Luther, and his followets. Morover; If you meane, that
one is not to profess any errour againſt his Conſcience, but that alſo he
ought his ſubmitt to judgment in all Points to a Church <pb n="558" facs="tcp:59214:289"/>lieved to be infallible in Fundamentalls, then you overthrow your

Church <hi>in all things having no other ground for it, but becauſe ſhe is
infallible in ſome things,</hi> that is, in Fundamentalls; becauſe <hi>in

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is but limited, and particular, and partiall, my adherence vpon
this ground, cannot poſſible be Abſolute, and vniverſall, and
Totall.</hi> Thirdly; vpon this your owne grant, it followes clearly, that
Luther could not in wiſdome forſake all Churches, becauſe Proteſtants
grant that all Churches, or the whole Church, cannot erre in Fundamentall
Points, and therfore in wiſdome could not be forſaken in any thing at all;
not that your firſt Proteſtants can be excuſed from Schiſme in doing
ſo. But againe, if they were obliged to ſubmitt their judgment to the
Church, and had done ſo (as indeed they ought to haue done) their
profeſſing a Faith contrary to that of the Church, as Luther did had been
alſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess an errour contrary to their owne conſcience: and ſo
whatſoever you ſay, you are confuted by your owne grounds which appeares
more by theſe your express words (Pag: 280. N. 95.) <hi>What man of judgment
will thinke it any disparagement to his judgment to preferre a field not
perfectly weeded before a field that is quite over-runne with weeds and
thornes? And therfore though Proteſtants haue ſome Errours, yet ſeeing
they are not ſoe great as yours; he that concei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

change your Communion for theirs, though confeſſed to haue ſome
corruptions, it may well be preſumed that he hath but little judgment.</hi>
Do not theſe words declare your opinion, that in caſe of perplexity, when
of two Evills one muſt be choſen, it is judgment, and conſequently no
ſinne, to make choiſe of the less? This is the very thing which I haue
alledged out of Divines, and which obliges you to anſwer your owne argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
againſt Charity maintayned. This your chiefeſt objection being anſwered,
confuted, and retorted, let vs examine the reſt.</p>
               <p n="136">136. You ſay (Pag: 164. N. 57.) <hi>It is
impoſſible to adhere</hi> to the Roman Church <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="137">137. Anſwer. Although indeed, if once we ſuppoſe
that we cannot know what Points are Fundamentall, it be an evident
conſequence, that we can never belieue the Church in ſome things, vnless,
we belieue her in all, and ſo your objection is of no force; yet <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> 
                  <pb n="559" facs="tcp:59214:290"/>never ſayd, that one may adhere to the
Church in all things, preciſely and formally, becauſe ſhe is infallible
in ſome things; which in ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good Logicke, had been like to
this Argument: Mans vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is infallible in ſome things, for
example, in the moſt vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall knowne principles, as, that two
contradictoryes cannot be true: or that every whole is greater than a part
therof, and the like: Therfore I am to belieue, mans vnderſtanding to be
infallible in all things. But he ſpoke morally, and pro ſubjectâ
materia, and therfore ſayd expreſſly; ſeing Proteſtants grant the
Church to be infallible in Points neceſſary to ſalvation, 
<q rend="margQuotes">any wiſe man will inferre, that it
behooves all, who haue care of their ſoules, not to forſake her.</q> Where
you ſee; he ſpeakes of what were to be done in wiſedowne, and for the
ſafety of ones ſoule, and conſiders tkings (as in this ſubject they
ought to be conſidered) in a morall, not in a Logicall; or Metaphiſicall
way, That the Church being confeſſedly infallible, in all neceſſary
Points, men muſt conſider well, how they leaue her in any point, leaſt
perhaps, either that point wherin they forſake her, be a Fundamentall point,
or els leaſt they may fall into ſome Fundamentall errour, after they haue
left her; as alſo, that ſeing they rely on her Authority in Fundamentall
Articles, it is no wiſdome to ſuſpect her credit in matters of less
moment; eſpecially conſidering the many examples of thoſe, who de facto
forſaking the Church, haue fallen into damnable, and Fundamentall Hereſyes:
and in a word; ſeing there may be great danger in leaving the Church, and
damnation cannot be feared by adhering to her, which I am ſure nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth,
nor can erre in Points neceſſary to ſalvation, there may be great harme
in leaving, but no hurt in fellowing Her, in all that ſhe propoſes, as
matter of Faith: which is your owne grant, as we haue ſeene aboue, in theſe
words (Pag: 168. N. 63.) <hi>It is true if we ſayd, there were no danger in
being of the Roman Church, and there were danger in leaving it, it were madness
to perſwade any man to leaue it.</hi> Now that the Roman Church doth not erre
in Fundamentall or neceſſary Points, I will proue herafter out of your owne
words, out of Potter, and other Proteſtants; and therfore it was madneſſe
to perſwade men to leaue Her.</p>
               <p n="138">138. Theſe, and the like morall, and prudentiall
Arguments, <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> vrged: which truly in a matter
concerning Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ought to mooue every one; and more, than meere
Metaphyſicall ſpeculations. And that this diſcourſe of <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> was very <pb n="560" facs="tcp:59214:290"/>reaſonable, yourſelfe make
good in your words which I haue cited, that if there <hi>were ſet vp ſome
ſetled ſociety of Chriſtians, for our guide in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls, then,
Charity Maintayned</hi> might with ſome colour, and ſhew of reaſon, haue
concluded, that we could not in wiſdome forſake this Church in any Point
<hi>for feare of forſaking Her in a neceſſary Point.</hi> What <hi>Mr.
Chillingworth? For feare of forſaking Her in a neceſſary Point?</hi> What
colour of reaſon can there be in this your feare? Seing we haue heard you
tell vs (P. 164. N. 57.) <hi>It is impoſſible to adhere to the Roman Church
in all things, having no other ground for it, but becauſe she is infallible
in ſome things.</hi> And what will become of your vaine Dialogue in this
ſame ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherby with great pompe of words, you endeavour to prove,
that it is <hi>impoſſible to adhere to the Roman Church in all thingr,
hauing no other ground</hi> &amp;c? Is it not cleare, that you contradict
yourſelfe, and are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to anſwer all the Arguments, which you object
againſt <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> for ſaying, that if the Church be
infallible in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, it is no wiſdome to leaue her in any Point? Can
one judge, that there is reaſon for that which the ſame man is confident
(which is your owne word Pag: 165. N. 57.) may be demonſtrated to be falſe?
And by this appeares, that your whole diſcourſe (N. 63.) is againſt this
your owne grant. Neither do we ſay, that vniverſally, one muſt ſtick to
one ſide, for feare of going too far towards the other; but that, when there
is no harme, in embracing one part, and evident danger in forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, in
ſuch a caſe, we cannot forſake one part, and goe to the other; that is we
cannot forſake the Church in Points, not neceſſary for ſalvation:
becauſe we may chance to leaue her in ſome Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Point; which even
yourſelfe grant to be a rationall deduction, if once it be ſuppoſed, that
any particular Church is infallible in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Points, as Proteſtants
commonly grant, the vniverſall Church to be infallible in ſuch Articles:
and therfore, as I ſayd aboue, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his fellowes could not in
wiſdome forſake the vniverſall Church in any one Point. Morover remember
what you write (Pag: 277. N. 61.) in theſe words: <hi>Neither is there any
reaſon, why a Church ſhould pleaſe herſelfe too much, for retaining
fundamentall truthes, while ſhe remaines regardless of others. For, who is
there that can put her in ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient caution, that theſe errours about
profitable matters, may not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vſuall fecundity of errour,
bring forth others of a higher quality ſuch as are pernicious and
peſtilent, and vndermine by ſecret conſequences, the very foundations of
Religion and Piety?</hi> If this be true of the vniverſal 
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:59214:291"/>Church, which is infallible for Fundamentalls: much more
may we ſay of any private perſon (who hath no ſuch priviledg of
infallibility) forſaking the Church in ſome Point of Faith; <hi>Who is
there can put him in ſufficient caution, that theſe Errours about
profitable matters, may not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vſuall fecundity of Errour,
bring forth others of a higher quality ſuch as are pernicious and
peſtilent, and vndermine by ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, the very fundations of
Religion and Piety?</hi> And therfore <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Maintayned</hi> had reaſon
to ſay, that the Church ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken in any leaſt Point,
leaſt perhaps that proue to be Fundamentall. Neither can you ſay, that
Proteſtants were certaine, that the Points wherin they left the Church, were
errours. For, to omit the reaſons which I haue already giuen here, I muſt
put you in mynd, that diverſe learned chiefe Proteſtants agree with vs in
very many, yea, I may ſay, in all the maine differences, betwixt
Proteſtants and vs: And therfore your preence of ſo great evidence, and
certainty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrine of the Roman Church, is meerly voluntary and
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball. And beſides, I would know, how the Church can be ſuppoſed to be
infallible in fundamentall Points, and yet may be in danger to fall into ſuch
errours as are pernicious and peſtilent, and vndermine the very Fundations of
Religion and Piety?</p>
               <p n="139">139. Theſe maine diſſicultyes being taken away,
your other Objections, cited aboue, are anſwered, by only mentioning them.
The Queſtion is not, whether we ſhould erre with the preſent Church, or
hold true with God Almighty, as you vainly ſpeak; but whether the word, and
will of God Almighty, be better vnderſtood, and declared to vs by Gods
vniverſall true Church, or by any private perſon or particulat Sect.</p>
               <p n="140">140. If particular Churches haue been liberall of their
Anathemas, which yet were never conceaved infallible: What is that to the
Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themas, of the vniverſall Church granted to be infallible in fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall
points, in which whoſoever diſobeyes her, puts himſelfe in ſtate of
damnation. And ſeing you confess, that men cannot know what points be
fundamentall, it followes, that we cannot with ſafety diſobey her in any
one point, for feare of leaving her in ſome fundamentall Article.</p>
               <p n="141">141. That the viſible Church of Chriſt holds
itſelfe to be infallible, cannot be doubted; ſeing even her enemyes belieue
ſhe cannot erre in fund mentall Points, and ſhe propoſes all her
definitions of faith to be believed, without diſtinguiſhing betweene Points
fundamentall, and <pb n="562" facs="tcp:59214:291"/>not Fundamentall: which ſhe could not
doe without great temerity, and injury to Faithfull people, if ſhe did not
hold herſelfe to be vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally infallible. Of which point <hi>Ch: Ma</hi>
(P. 2. Ch: 5. N. 20. P. 132.) ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes at large, in anſwer to a demand or
objection of Potter: and in vaine you ſay; God (in Scripture) <hi>can better
informe vs what are the limits of the Churches Power than the Church
herſelfe.</hi> For, the Queſtion is only whether God will haue his meaning
in Scripture, declared by the Church, or by every mans private ſpirit, wit,
or fancy. Beſides, God declares his ſacred pleaſure, not only by the
written, but alſo by the vnwritten word.</p>
               <p n="142">142. That there is no danger in being of the Roman
Church, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants muſt affirme, who hold, that ſhe had all things
neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as ſhall appeare herafter: and whoſoever
denyes it, muſt grant that Chriſt had no Church vpon Earth, when Luther
appeared: and that there is danger to leaue her, experience makes manifeſt,
by the infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te multitude of different Sects, and opinions, wherof all cannot
be true and ſo muſt be eſteemed a deluge of Hereſyes.</p>
               <p n="143">143. The Hereſy of the Donatiſts, did conſiſt
formally, in this; that the Church might erre or be polluted, and by that
Meanes giue juſt cauſe to forſake her communion. For, if without any
ſuch errour in their vnderſtanding, they did only de facto ſeparate by
the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of their will, they were indeed Schiſmatikes, but not
He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, as not dividing themſelves from the Church in Matter of Faith:
And yet Potter ſaieth they were properly Heretiques. Yea if it be not an
Hereſy to ſay in generall, that the Church may erre, and be corrupted or
polluted; to ſay, that in ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe ſhe is corrupted,
comes to be only a matter of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or fact whether ſhe hath done ſo,
or no; but it is not a point of Faith, and ſo is not of a nature ſufficient
to conſtiute an Hereſy; ſuppoſing, as I ſaied, it be once granted,
that ſhe may erre: For example; the Donatiſts gaue out, that the Catholique
Church was defild, by communicating with thoſe who were called tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
The Hereſy conſiſts preciſely in this Point; That the whole Church may
be corrupted, and ſo give juſt cauſe to be forfaken; not in that other
Point, whether, or no (the poſſibility of the thing being ſuppoſed) de
facto Catholikes did communicate with thoſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours. Since therfore it is
ſuppoſed by you, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d affirmed by Potter, that the Donatiſts were
heretiks, their hereſy muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt in this; that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique 
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:59214:292"/>Church ſpredd over the whole world, might erre, and be
polluted. And is not this the very hereſy of Proteſtants?) And do they not
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to leaue the Church, vpon this ſame ground, that ſhe erred? And
this particularly is evident, in thoſe Proteſtants, who ſay, the whole
viſible Church before Luther, periſhed; The names of which Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
may be ſeene in <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. N. 9. Pag: 161.) and
more may be read in Brierley (Tract: 2. Ca: 3. Sect: 2.) And therefore I
wonder, you would ſay, that <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> had not named thoſe
<hi>Proteſtants who hold the Church to haue periſhed for many Ages.</hi>
That it is a fundamentall errour, of its owne nature properly hereticall to
ſay, <hi>The Church Militant may posſibly be driven out of the world,</hi>
is the Doctrine of Potter, as we haue ſeene; as alſo, that Whitaker calls
it a prophane he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy; and more Proteſtants may be ſeene to that
purpoſe in that place where we cited Whitaker: And Dr. Lawd holds it to be
againſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Creed, I belieue the Holy Catholique Church; and
that to ſay, that Article is not true, is blaſphemy.</p>
               <p n="144">144. That he which is an Hererike in one Article, may
haue true Faith in other Articles, is againſt the true and common Doctrine of
all Catolique Divines, and vniverſally againſt all Catholikes, to ſay,
That ſuch a Faith can be ſufficient to ſalvation; becauſe his very
hereſy is a deadly ſin; And therfore to ſay, the Church can erre, in any
one point of Faith, is to ſay, the whole Church may be in ſtate of
damnation for faith; which is an intollerable injury to God, and his ſpouſe
the Church. For, if ſhe may be in ſtate of damnation, by any culpable
errour, ſhe muſt be ſuppoſed to want ſome thing neceſſary to
ſalvation; namely, the beliefe of that truth which ſuch culpable errour
denyes. But more of this herafter.</p>
               <p n="145">145. By the way. How can you ſay (N. 56.) to
<hi>Charity Maintayned;</hi> That, <hi>when it was for his purpoſe to haue it
ſo, the greatness or ſmallness of the matter was not conſiderable, the
Evidence of the Revelation was all in all.</hi> For, where doth <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> ſay, <hi>That evidence of the Revelation is all in all?</hi>
Yea, doth he not expreſſly teach Part: 1. Chap. 6. N. 2.) that evidence is
not compatible with an ordinary Act of Faith, and therby proves (N. 30.) that

contrarily, I hope, that the Reader, if he be not a Proteſtant, will find
juſt occaſion to prayſe God that the Anſwer to this your Objection,
will demonſtrate to him in how ſafe a way we Catholikes are, even by the

               <p n="148">148. I haue already, vpon ſeverall occaſions,
mentioned ſome paſſages, wherin you and Dr. Potter confeſſe that the
Roman Church, wants nothing neceſſary to ſalvation. Now I will doe it
more at large. Potter (Pag: 63.) ſaith; <hi>The moſt neceſſary and
fundamentall Truths, which conſtitute a Church are on both ſides
vnqueſtioned: And for that reaſon, learned Proteſtants yield them

Proteſtants yield them &amp;c.</hi> In proofe wherof, he cites in his

Biſhop of Exeter;</hi> and adds; <hi>The very Anabaotiſts grant it. Fr.
Ichnſon in his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an plea,</hi> (Pa: 123.) So that with this one
Teſtimony of Potter, we haue many other, even of our greateſt
Adverſaryes. And I deſire the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obſerue well, that here (P:62)
he ſaith; <hi>To thoſe twelue Articles which the Apoſtles in their Creed,

their Transſubſtantiation, and dry Communion, their Purgatory, Invocation
of Saints, Worſhip of Images, Latine ſervice, trafficke of Indulgences; and
ſhortly, the other new Doctrines and Decrees canonized in their late Synode
of Trent. Vpon theſe and the like new Articles, is all the conteſtation
between the Romaniſts and Proteſtants.</hi> And then he adds the words
which we haue cited; <hi>The moſt neceſſary and Fundamentall truths which
conſtatute a Church, are on both ſides vnqueſtioned; and for that
&amp;c.</hi> Where we ſee he grants, we belieue the twelue Articles of the
Apoſtles Creed, which he teaches at large, to containe all Fundamentall
Points of Faith; and that we hold all the moſt neceſſary and Fundamentall
truths which conſtitute a Church. Therfore, thoſe Points of our Doctrine
which he giues for inſtance, are no Fundementall errours, nor the contrary
Articles, neceſſary and Fundamentall truths: and <pb n="565" facs="tcp:59214:293"/>yet
he names all the Chiefeſt Points controverted betweene vs: and Proteſtants;
even tranſubſtantiation, Communion in one kind, and Latine Service, which
are the things they are wont moſt to oppoſe; yea he compriſes all the
Doctrines and Decrees of the Councell of Trent. Therfore we are free from
fundamentall errours, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our Adverſaryes. (Pag: 59.)
<hi>The Proteſtants never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to erect a new Church, but to purge the
Old. The Reformation did not change the ſubſtance of Religion, but only
clenſed it from corrupt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure qualityes.</hi> If the Proteſtants
erected not a new Church, then ours is ſtill the Old Church; and if it were
only clenſed from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt qualityes, without change of the ſubſtance,
the ſubſtance muſt be ſtill the ſame that it was, and that which was,
muſt be the ſame with that which is. (Pag: 61.) <hi>The things which the
Proteſtants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue on their part, and wherin they judge the life and
ſubſtance of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be comprized, are moſt, if not all of them,
ſo evidently and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably true, that their Adverſaryes themſelves
do avow and receaue them as well as they.</hi> Therfore we Catolikes haue the
life and ſubſtance of Religion. (Pag: 60.) <hi>In the prime grounds of
Principles or Chriſtian Religion wee haue not forſaken the Church of
Rome.</hi> Therfore you grant that we haue the prime grounds, or Fundamentall
Articles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. (Pag: 11.) <hi>For thoſe Catholique Verityes which
ſhe</hi> (the Roman Church) <hi>retaines, we yield her a member of the
Catholike, though one of the moſt vnſound and corrupt members. In this
ſenſe, the Romaniſts may be called Catholikes.</hi> Behold, we are
members of the Catholike Church, which could not be, if we erred in any one
fundamentall Point. By the way: If the Romaniſts may be called Catholikes,
why may not the Roman Church be termed Catholique? And yet this is that
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which Proteſtants are wont to vrge againſt vs; and Potter in
particular, in this very place, not conſidering that he impugnes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
while he ſpeakes againſt vs, nor diſtinguiſhing between vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall,
as Logicians ſpeake of it, (which ſignifyes, one common thing,

Church of Rome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in ſome doctrines and practiſes, there might be juſt and
neceſſary cauſe, though the Church of Rome wanted nothing neceſſary
to ſalvation.</hi> (P: 70.) <hi>They</hi> (the Roman Doctours) <hi>confess
that ſetting aſide all matters controverted, the maine poſitiue truths
wherin all agree, are abundantly ſufficient to every good Chriſtian, both
for his knowledge, and for his practiſe, teaching him what to belieue, and
how to liue, ſo as he may be ſaved.</hi> His ſaying, that <hi>the Roman
Doctours confeſſe, that ſetting a ſide all matters controverted
&amp;c.</hi> is very vntrue: it being manifeſt, that Catholikes belieue,
Proteſtants to erre damnably, both in matters of Faith, and practiſe; yet
his words convince ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem, that we haue all that is neceſſary, yea and
abundantly ſufficient, both for knowledg, and practiſe for vs to be
ſaved. And then he diſcourſing of the Doctrines wherin we differ from
Proteſtants, ſaith (Pag: 74.) <hi>If the miſtaker will ſuppoſe his
Roman Church and Religion pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from theſe and the like confeſſed
exceſſes and noveltyes, he ſhall find in that which remaines, little
difference of importance betweene vs.</hi> Therfore de facto we belieue all
things of importance which Proteſtants belieue. After theſe words, without
any interruption he goes forward, and ſayes (Pag: 75.) <hi>But by this
diſcourſe, the Miſtaker happily may belieue his cauſe to be advantaged,
and may reply. If Rome want nothing eſsentiall to Religion, or to a Church,
how then can the Reformers juſtify their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that Church, or
free themſelves from damnable Schiſme?</hi> Doth not this diſcourſe
proue, and the Objection, which he rayſes from it, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that we want
nothing eſſentiall to Religion? Otherwiſe, this Objection which he makes
to himſelfe, were clearly impertinent, and fooliſh, if he could haue
diſpatched all, by ſaying, we erre in eſſentiall points, which had been
an evident, and more than a juſt cauſe, to juſtify their ſeparation:
which yet appeares further by his Anſwer to the ſayd Objection; That <hi>to
depart from a particular Church, and namely from the Church of Rome, in ſome
Doctrines and practiſes, there might be juſt and neceſsary cauſe,
though the Church of Rome wanted nothing ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſsary to ſalvation.</hi> And afterward in
the next (P. 76.) ſpeaking of the Church of Rome; he ſaith expreſſly:
<hi>Her Communion we forſake not, no more than the Body of Chriſt, wherof
we acknowledg the Church of Rome to be a member, though corrupted. And this
cleares vs from the imputation of Schiſme, whoſe property it is to cut of
from the Body of Chriſt, and the hope of ſalvation, the Church from which
it ſeparates. But if ſhe did erre in any</hi> 
                  <pb n="567" facs="tcp:59214:294"/>one
Fundamentall point, by that very errour ſhe would ceaſe to be a member of
the Body of Chriſt, and ſhould be cut of from the hope of ſalvation;
therfore ſhe doth not erre in any Fundamentall Point (P. 83.) <hi>we were
never diſioyned from her</hi> (the Church of Rome) <hi>in thoſe maine
eſſentiall truths, which giue her the name and eſſence of a
Church.</hi> You muſt then ſay, that ſhe erres not in any Fundamentall
Point. For, the eſſence of a Church, cannot conſiſt with any ſuch
errour. And that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, how deſirous he is that it ſhould be
believed, Catholiks and Proteſtants not to differ in the eſſence of
Religion, he adds theſe words immediatly after thoſe which we haue laſt
cited: <hi>wherof if the Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker doubt, he may be better informed by ſome
late Roman Catholique Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. One of France, who hath purpoſely in a large
Treatiſe proved (as be believes) the Hugonots and Catholikes of that Kingdome
to be all of the ſame Church, and Religion, becauſe of the truths agreed
vpon by both: And another of our Country (as it is ſayd) who hath lately
publiſhed a large Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of learned Authors, both Papiſts and
Proteſtants, who are all of the ſame mynd.</hi> Thus you ſee, he
ranſacks all kind of proofes, to ſhew that Catholikes and Proteſtants
differ not in the ſubſtance, and eſſence of Faith, and to that end
cites for Catholike Writers, thoſe two who can be no Catholiks, as
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Chap: 3. Pag: 104.) ſhewes the former
in particular to be a plaine Heretike, or rather Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, Lucian-like,
jeaſting at all Religion. (Pag: 78.) he ſaith; <hi>we hope and thinke very
well of all thoſe Holy and devout ſoules, which in former Ages lived and
dyed in the Church of Rome. Nay, our Charity reaches further to all thoſe at
this day, who in ſimplicity of heart belieue the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Religion and
profeſſe it.</hi> To theſe words of the Doctour, if we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; But
it were impoſſble, that any can be ſaved, even by Ignorance, or any
ſimplicity of heart, if he erre in a Fundamentall point (becauſe as by
every ſuch errour, a Church ceaſes to be a Church, ſo every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
perſon ceaſes to be a member of the true Churchs) the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will
be, that we do not erre in any Fundamentall point. Nay (Pag: 79.) he ſaith
further, we belieue it (the Roman Religion) ſafe, that is, by Gods great
Mercy, not damnable to ſome, ſuch as belieue what they profeſſe:
<hi>But we belieue it not ſafe, but very dangerous, if not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
damnable to ſuch as profess it when they belieue (or if their hearts were
vpright, and not perverſely obſtinate, might belieue) the contrary.</hi>
Behold we are not only in a poſſibility to be ſaved; we are even ſafe,
vpon condition, we belieue that Faith to be true which we profeſſe, and 
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:59214:294"/>for which we haue ſuffered ſo long, ſo great, and
ſo many loſſes, in all kinds; which if we did vndergoe, for extetnall
profeſſion of that Faith, which we do not inwardly belieue to betrue, we
ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue rather to be begged for fooles, than perſecuted for our
Religion. In the meane tyme, every Catholike hath this comfort, that he is
ſafe, (even by the confeſſion of an Adverſary) if he be not a fooliſh
diſſembler, which would be cauſe of damnation in a Proteſtant, or any
other. Even the profeſſion of a truth, believed to be falſe, is a ſin.
But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to ſay; it were impoſſible for any Roman Catholike to be
ſafe, vpon what condition ſoever, if we erre in any one Fundamentall
Article of Faith. Here I muſt briefly note, that wheras Dr. Potter in the
words now alledged, ſaith; <hi>It is not damnable to ſome,</hi> and then to
declare who thoſe <hi>ſome</hi> are, adds, <hi>ſuch as belieue what they
profess; Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> (Pag: 404. N. 29.) leaves out the diſtinction,
or comma, placed betweene <hi>ſome</hi> and <hi>ſuch,</hi> and puts it
after <hi>damnable.</hi> Thus: <hi>Not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to ſome ſuch as beleue
what they profeſſe;</hi> which words may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, that it is not ſafe
to all ſuch as belieue what they profeſſe, which may much alter the
ſenſe of Potters words, as the Reader will perceiue by comparing them.</p>
               <p n="149">149. Now Sir, who will not wonder, at your ſo often
declaiming againſt <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> for ſaying; Dr: Potter
taught, that the Roman Church doth not erre in Fundamentall Points? But what if
your ſelfe ſay the ſame? It is cleare you do ſo. For, wheras
<hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> (Part: 1. Pag: 15. N. 13.) ſaith: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Since Dr. Potter will be forced to
grant that there can be aſſigned no viſible true Church of Chriſt,
diſtinct from the Church of Rome, and ſuch Churches as greed with her, when
Luther firſt appeared, I deſire him to declare, whether it do not follow,
that ſhe hath not erred Fundamentally; becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch errour
deſtroyes the nature and being of a Church, and ſo our Saviour Chriſt
ſhould haue had no viſible Church on Earth:</q> To theſe words (which you
thought fit to ſet downe very imperfectly) you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (Pag: 16 N. 20.) In
this manner: <hi>I ſay, in our ſenſe of the word Fundamentall, it does
follow. For, if it be true, that there was then no Church diſtinct from the
Roman, then it muſt be, either becauſe there was no Church at all, which we
deny; or becauſe the Roman Church was the whole Church, which we alſo deny:
Or becauſe ſhe was a part of the whole, which we grant. And if ſhe were a
true Part of the Church, then ſhe retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe truths which were
ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation, and held no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours 
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:59214:295"/>which were inevitably and vnpardonably deſtructiue of
it. For, this is preciſely neceſſary to conſtitute any man or any
Church a member of the Church Catholique. In our ſenſe therfore of the word
Fuudamentall, I hope ſhe erred not Fundamentally: But in your ſenſe of
the word, I feare ſhe did. That is, ſhe held ſome thing to be Divine
Revelation, which was not; ſome thing not to be, which was.</hi> You haue
ſpoken ſo clearly and fully in favour of the Roman Church, and not only
affirmed, but proved that ſhe did not erre in any Fundamentall Point, that I
need not ſay one word to ponder your words, or declare the force of them.
(Pag: 7. N. 3.) You expreſſly approue the ſaying of Dr. Potter, That
<hi>both ſides by the confeſſion of both ſides, agree in more Points
then are ſimply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation, and
differ only in ſuch as are not preciſely neceſſary.</hi> Therfore, do
we inferr, Catholikes belieue all that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation, and
more. But we can never yield ſo much to you. (Pag. 85. N. 89.) You
<hi>confeſſe the Roman Church to be a Part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church;</hi>
And we haue heard you ſay (Pag: 16. N. 20.) <hi>If ſhe were a true Part of
the Church, then ſhe retained thoſe truths which were ſimply
neceſſary to ſalvation, and beld no errours which were inevitably and
vnpardonably deſtructiue of it. For, this is preciſely neceſſary to
conſtitute any man or any Church, a member of the Church Catholique.</hi>
This you ſay, and make good the like inference, which I made by occaſion of
Dr. Potters words, that the Roman Church is a member of the Catholique; and
other like Aſſertions of his. (Pag: 163. N. 56.) You ſay: <hi>From
Scripture we collect our hope, that the Truths ſhe</hi> (the Roman Church)
<hi>retaines, and the practiſe of them, may proue an Antiaote to her
againſt the errours which ſhe maintaines in ſuch perſons as in
ſimplicity of hart fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Abſalon. Theſe Points of Chriſtianity,
which haue in them the nature of Antidots againſt the poyſon of all ſins
and errors, the Church of Rome, though otherwiſe much corrupted, ſtill
retaines; therfore we hope ſhe erreh not Fundamentally, but ſtill remaines
a Part of the Church. But this can be no warrant to vs to thinke with her in
all things: Seeing the very ſame Scripture which puts vs in hope ſhe errs
not Fundamentally,</hi> (marke how you profeſſe to learne, even out of
Scripture, that we erre not Fundamentally) <hi>aſſures vs, that in many
things, and thoſe of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe errs very grievouſly. And theſe
errors though to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them, we hope they will not be pernicious,
yet the profeſſing of them against conſcience, could not but bring to vs
certaine damnation.</hi> Therefore, the Points in which we differ from
Proteſtants, being acknowledged <pb n="570" facs="tcp:59214:295"/>not to be Fundamentall,
and in other Points profeſſing nothing againſt our conſcience, we are
ſafe by your owne Confeſſion. If we did not belieue as we profess, we
were no Roman Catholikes. In the ſame place you ſay expreſſly, <hi>De
facto we hope</hi> the Roman Church <hi>does not erre in Fundamentalls;</hi>
yea you ſay, (Lin: 33.) <hi>Perhaps ſhe does not erre damnably,</hi> the
contrary wherof you affirme ſo often. You example of Abſalon, was very ill
applyed to the Roman Church, which did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell from you, but you againſt
the whole Church (the Mother of all Chriſtians) more ſacrilegiouſly, than
Abſalon behaved himſelfe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to wards his father. (Pag: 404. N. 29.)
you approue Dr. Potters ſaying (Pag: 79.) which I cited aboue that the Roman
Religion is ſafe, <hi>that is, not damnable to ſome, ſuch as beleeue what
they profeſſe.</hi> And in the ſame place you ſay <hi>we may hope that
ſhe retaines thoſe Truths which are ſimply, abſolutely and
indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fundamentall and ſimply neceſſary Truths which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by which,
ſome good ſoules among you may be ſaved, but abhorre your many
ſuperſtitions and hereſyes. The Truths you retaine, are good, and, as we
hope, ſufficient to bring good ignorant ſoules among you, to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
yet are not to be ſought for in the conventi le of Papiſts.</hi> If any
ſoule may be ſaved in our Religion; it is cleare that we hold not any
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall errour, with which no ſoule can be ſaved. (Pag: 277. N. 61.)
you ſay: <hi>The ſimple defect of ſome Truths proſitable only, and not
ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, may conſiſt with ſalvation.</hi> Seing therfore
you haue ſo often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that we erre not in Fundamentall Points,
our errours in ſome Truths profitable only, and not fundamentall, may
conſiſt with ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. How then do you ſay to Catholiks, (Pag: 401.
N. 27.) <hi>As for our freeing you from damnable Herely, and yielding you
ſalvation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He, (Dr. Potter) nor any other Proteſtant is guilty of
it?</hi> (Pag: 219. N. 50.) ſpeaking of Proteſtants, you ſay; <hi>They

Now you know well, that in Points of greateſt moment, which Catholiks belieue
againſt ſome Proteſtants, other Proteſtants ſtand for vs, againſt
their pretended Brethren: and therfore you muſt either ſay that we belieue
all ſuch Doctrines as are abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that
many learned Proteſtants do not belieue all ſuch Doctrines, and
conſequently are not capable of Salvation. (Pag: <pb n="571" facs="tcp:59214:296"/>(Pag:
269. N. 45.) <hi>A man may poſſibly leaue ſome opinion or practiſe of a
Church formerly common to himſelfe and others, and continue ſtill a member
of that Church: Provided that what he forſakes, be not one af thoſe things
wherin the eſſence of the Church conſiſts.</hi> For this cauſe you
ſay, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Proteſtants left the externall Communion of the Church,
yet they left not the Church, becauſe they left her not in any thing
eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to a Church, as Fundamentall Points are: Therfore you
ſuppoſe, the Church before Luther, did not erre in any Fundamentall
Article: Otherwiſe you had left her, that is, you had diſagreed from her in
a Fundamentall Point. (Pag: 272. N. 52. and Pag: 283. N. 73.) You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that
Proteſtants divided <hi>themſelves from the Church, abſolutely and

ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that the Church before Luther, believed all
eſſentiall, and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Points, which Proteſtants alſo pretend to
hold, and for that cauſe, ſay they left not the Church. (Pag: 272. N. 52.)
You ſay) <hi>In the reaſon of our ſeparation from the externall Communion
of your Church you are miſtaken: For, it was not ſo much becauſe ſhe,
your Church, as becauſe your Churches externall Communion was corrupted, and
needed Reformation.</hi> But if we erred in Fundamentall Points, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
muſt haue forſaken vs chiefly for that reaſon, that our Church was
corrupted with Fundamentall errours of Faith. Therfore you grant, that we erred
not in any ſuch neceſſary Points. (Pag: 401. N. 26.) You confess, that
Dr: Potter ſaith <hi>indeed, that our not cutting of your Church from the
Body of Chriſt, and hope of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion frees vs from the imputation of
Schiſme.</hi> (Pag: 133. N. 12.) You ſay expreſſly: <hi>By
Confeſſion of both ſides we agree in much more than is ſimply and
indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> It is well you make ſo
open a Confeſſion, that we belieue much more, than is ſimply
neceſſary to ſalvation. But, as I ſayd aboue, we will not, becauſe we
cannot, yield ſo much to you. And here I muſt aske againe; How you could
ſay, (Pag: 401. N. 27.) <hi>As for our freeing you from damnable Hereſy,
and yielding you ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither Dr. Potter, nor any other Proteſtant
is guilty of it?</hi> Seing you ſay, that <hi>By the confeſſion of both

neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> If we belieue much more then is
neceſſary to ſalvation, by what Logicke will you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, that we belieue

               <p n="151">151. To theſe teſtimonyes of Potter and
<hi>Chillingworth,</hi> many other might be allelged, out of other
Proteſtants, as we haue ſeene diverſe other alledged by Potter. Dr. Lawd
(Pag: 299) ſaith: <hi>I do aknowledge a Posſibility of ſalvation in the
Roman Church. But ſo, as that which I grant to Romanists, is not as they are
Romanists, but as they are Christians, that is, as they beleeve the Creed, and
hold the foundation Christ himſelfe.</hi> Behold, not only a poſſibility
of ſaluation, but alſo the reaſon therof, becauſe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the Creed
&amp;c: which is the very reaſon for which Proteſtants hold, that they
themſelues may be ſaved, though they differ in many Points from one
another. This I ſay, is the reaſon of Dr. Lawd, which other Proteſtants
muſt approue, though in true Divinity it be of no force at all; for, though
one belieue the Creed, and hold the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt himſelfe, that is,
that he is God, and Saviour of the world, yet if he deny, any point evidently
delivered in Scripture, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſufficiently propounded, as revealed
by God, he cannot be ſaved, even according to Proteſtants, who therfore doe
in this, as in many other things, ſpeake inconſequently, and contradict
themſelves. (Pag: 376.) he ſayth: <hi>The Religion of the Proteſtants,
and the Romaniſts Religion, is the ſame: nor do the Church of Rome and the
Proteſtants, ſet vp a different Religion (for the Chriſtian Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is
the ſame to both) but they differ in the ſame Religion.</hi> Therfore,
ſay I we hold no Fundamentall errours, wherin whoſoever differ, cannot be
of the ſame, but muſt be of a different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And (Pag. 129.) <hi>The
Proteſtants haue not left the Church of Rome in her Eſſence, not in the
things which conſtitute a Church.</hi> And (P: 282.) he ſaith <hi>The
poſſibility of ſalvation in the Roman Church, I thinke cannot be
denyed;</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in proofe hereof, (P: 281.) he alledges Luther. Field. Jos:
Hall, Geo: Abbot, Hooker, Mornaeus, Prideaux, Calvin. And Dr. Jer: Taylor in
his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Prophecying (Pag: 251. Sect:

<hi>keepe the foundation, and belieue many more truths, than can be proved to
be of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <pb n="573" facs="tcp:59214:297"/>and originall necesſity to Salvation.
And therfore all the wiſeſt Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages of the adverſe party, allowed
to them posſibility of Salvation, whilſt their errours are not faults of
their will, but weakneſſes and deceptions of the vnderſtanding,</hi>
(which, as I ſayd, may eaſily be believed of vs Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, who ſuffer
ſo much for our Religion,) <hi>ſo that there is nothing in the foundation
of Faith that can reaſonably hinder them to be permitted: The foundation of
Faith ſtands ſecure enough for all their vaine and vnhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſuperſtructures.</hi> And in particular he ſhewes that Prayer for the
dead, and the Doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, are not Fundamentall
er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and alſo ſaieth: <hi>theſe two be in ſtead of the
reſt.</hi> Yea he affirmes (Pag: 258.) that there is implied as great
difficulty in the Myſtery of the B. Trinity, as in the Doctrine of
Tranſubſtantiation; and ſhewes that we are not in any danger of ſinning
by idolatry, in adoring the Sacrament. For further ſatisfaction in this
matter, the Reader will find the words of learned Proteſtants in Brierley,
(Tract: 2. Sect: 14.) As; <hi>That we are of the Church:</hi> That <hi>we are

               <p n="132">132. I hope now it appeares, that even in the judgment
of learned Proteſtants, Catholikes do not erre in points Fundamentall, or
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation: and therfore, that Luther could not be excuſed
from Schiſme, in dividing himſelfe from all Churches, for matters which do
not exclude vs from eternall happyneſſe; eſpecially, ſeing they who
forſooke vs, maintayne errours at leaſt not Fundamentall, as Potter (Pag:

impoſſible they can be reconciled. It ſeemes that they of Geneua when
they ſett forth the Harmonie of Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were of opinion, that the
Harmonie or agreement of Confeſſions, did conſiſt only in bindeing vp
in one Uolume diſagreeing Confeſſions.</q> Nay, Proteſtants do further
teach, that it cannot be otherwiſe; that is; that it is impoſſible, that
they can agree in all points. Calvin (Inſtit: Lib: 4. Cap: 1. N. 12.)
ſpeakes plainly: Quoniam nemo eſt qui non &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe none is
free from ſome cloua of ignorance, we muſt either leaue no Church at all or
we muſt Pardon errours in thoſe things, of which men may be ignorant,
without breach both of the ſumme or ſubſtance of Religion, and loss of
ſalvation.</hi> Marke how this Patriark of Proteſtants, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that
noe Church can be free from errours, not Fundamentall. Dr. Lawed (Sect 38. Pag:
360.) <hi>In things not neceſſary (though they be Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne truths alſo) I
confess it were hartily to be wiſhed that men might be all of one minde, and

all humane frailtyes, which here hang thinke and cloſes about her.

thinke the ſame: if ſuch vanity be required, there would be noe Church at
all.</hi> (Potter Pag: 39.) <hi>It is a great vnity to hope or expect, that all

and particles of Divine Truth.</hi> And) Pag: 69.) He expreſſly
confeſſes that all the weeds are not perfectly taken away in the reformed
Church <hi>Chilling:</hi> (P. 279. N. 64.) <hi>the viſible Church is free
indeed from all errours <pb n="575" facs="tcp:59214:298"/>abſolutely deſtructiue and
vnpardonable, but not from all errour which in it ſelfe is damnable.</hi>
Morton (Appologie (Lib: 1.58) <hi>only Papiſts challenge priviledg of not
erring.</hi> And bleſſed be God, who hath placed vs in a Church which vpon
evident and neceſſary, Reaſon, challenges that priviledg, without which
there can be not infallibility in Chriſtian Faith, noe vnitie in the Church:
of which therfore we haue juſt cauſe to ſay with S. Auſtine Ep 48.
(wherewith Charity Maintayned ends the ſecond part of his booke,) Others (of
the Donatiſts) ſay: 
<q rend="margQuotes">we did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed belieue, that it
imported nothing, in what company we did hold the Faith of Chriſt. But thanks
be to our Lord who hath gathered vs from diviſion, and hath ſhewed to vs,
that it agreeth to one God, that he be worſhiped in vnity.</q> For what a
Church is that, which is divided even in points of Divine Faith? If ſuch
errours be ſufficient to divide from a Church (as Proteſtants pretend to
have parted from vs vpon that ground, and without which they muſt confess
themſelves to be Schiſmatikes) and that noe Church is free from ſuch
errours; what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, but that all Churches, and all men muſt be divided
from one another, and noe one Church be left in the whole world? And how can
they be excuſed from Schiſme, in leaving all Churches, for errours which no
Church can avoide? And who would be a Proteſtant, ſeing themſelves
confess, that they neither are, nor can, be free from damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errours, that
is, errours againſt Divine Revelation, which wil actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bring damnation
vpon them, that keep themſelves in them, by their owne voluntary and
avoidable fault, as you ſay (Pag: 279. 64.) So as for the Generall effect of
damnation, they differ not from funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall errours, which alſo are
pardonable by repentance.) Beſide, (Pag: 220. N. 52.) you ſay: <hi>by
fundamentall, we meane all, and only that which is neceſſary; and then I
hope you will grant that we may ſafely expect ſalvation in a Church which
hath all things Fundamentall to ſalvation.</hi> By which words you muſt
vnderſtand all truths neceſſary, becauſe they are revealed by God and
commanded, and not only things indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary of
themſelves; becauſe you ſay, one may ſafely expect ſalvation, if he
belieue all things Fundamentall, which ſafety he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect who erres in
points revealed (though not Fundamentall of themſelves) ſeing you teach
that all ſuch errours are damnable: and in plain termes (Pag 133. N. 12.) you
ſay; their ſtate is dangerous, which can not ſtand with ſafety;
therfore by Fundamentall points with the belief of which, one may ſafely
expect ſalvation; you muſt vnderſtand all points <pb n="576" facs="tcp:59214:298"/>not only Fundamentall of themſelves, but ſuch alſo as are
neceſſary, only, becauſe revealed. And (Pag: 290. N. 88.) you expreſly
giue thoſe errours of which we ſpeake, the name of fundamentall, (even as
one membrum dividens of Fundamentall as the Diviſum) in theſe wordes:
<hi>Fundamentall errours may ſignify, either ſuch as are repugnant to Gods
command, and ſo in their owne nature damnable, though to thoſe, which out
of invincible ignorance practiſe them, not vnpardonable: Or ſuch as are not
only meritoriously but remedileſſely pernicious and deſiructiue of
ſalvation.</hi> Well now theſe errours which you acknowledge in the
Proteſtant Church being againſt Gods Revelation and command, muſt be in
their owne nature damnable, as you doe not denie but they are ſo; and
therfore we ſay, that Luther and his fellows, could no more forſake the
Roman Church for ſuch errours, than they muſt forſake one an other, till
they leaue no Church at all, and all come to be Independents, both in
reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of others, and even of a mansſelfe, who muſt ſtill be
forſaking his owne errours againſt Faith, as being damnable in
themſelves. I neede not here repeat what I haue of necesſitie often
mentioned; That ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely we hold any Article againſt ſome Proteſtants,
in which we haue not other learned Proteſtants, on our ſide, againſt
their fellows, and I hope, you will not ſay, that the ſelfe ſame errours,
are even in their owne nature damnable in vs, and not in Proteſtants; which
were a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty non-ſenſe, and an vnjuſt partiality: therfore, I conclude
that this Objection is no less againſt Proteſtants, then vs: yea it is
vnanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weareable by Proteſtants, who confes, that really their Church is
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, and actually, is ſtained with ſuch errours, which we
abſolutely denie in reſpect of the Roman Church, and ſuch as agree with
her.</p>
               <p n="155">155. And here you muſt ponder your wordes (Pag: 280.
N. 95.) For, <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Pag: 184.) haveing alledged
Potters wordes (Pag: 69.) that the weedes are not perfectly taken away among
Proteſtants, ſaith: <hi>What man of judgement will be a Proteſtant,
ſince that Church is confeſſedly a corrupted one?</hi> To this you reply:
<hi>And yet you yourſelfe make large diſcourſes, in this very Chapter to
perſwade Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to continue in the Church of Rome, though
ſuppoſed to haue ſome corruptions. And why, I pray, may not a man of
judgement continue in the Communion of a Church confeſſedly corrupted, as
well as in a Church ſuppoſed to be corrupted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="156">156. To this your reply: I may anſwer out of what I
ſayd aboue. How I pray, is it all one to make a Suppoſition, acknowledged
by him <pb n="577" facs="tcp:59214:299"/>who makes it, to be a thing both vntrue, and
impoſſible, and to ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of a thing, ſo certainly and immoveably
true, that the contrary is impoſſible? The former caſe treates of a
voluntary ſuppoſition (which the ſuppoſer knowes he may recall, or
reverſe, at his pleaſure, and bring things to the true ſtate in which
they really exiſt; and ſo, as I may ſay, all will be mended, though he
ſet himſelfe to ſleepe, and leaue things to their owne nature) to ſhew
the preciſe eſſence of things, and what will follow in good
conſequence, vpon ſuch an hypotheſis of an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thing: as in
our preſent caſe, if the true Church were ſuppoſed to erre, in points
not Fundamentall (ſtill retaining infallibility in all fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls) it
followes, that it were more ſafe and less evill, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary
(vpon ſuppoſition of two vnavoidable evills) to remaine in the Church,
rather than ſo forſake her, for the reaſons alledged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; wheras
that ſuppoſition (That the Church erres) being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way (as indeed de
facto it is alwayes taken away, that is, it is alwayes falſe, and
impoſſible) the cleare conſequence is, that it is not only less evill,
but abſolutely good, and abſolutely neceſſary, to remaine in her
Communion; as by reaſon of the contrary (not voluntary and ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
but practicall and reall, and neceſſary) ſuppoſition of errours
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged defacto in the Proteſtants Church, without any pretence that
ſhe is in fallible in Fundamentalls (as the vniverſall Church is
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be even by our Adverſaryes, and in reall truth is
infallible in all points; both Fundamentall and not Fundamentall) the
Queſtion cannot remaine, whether it be less evill to remaine, in the
Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Proteſtant Church; but it muſt be believed, as a thing
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, that it is abſolutely evill, and the greateſt evill:
ſeing that by aduering to the Catholique Church, I am ſecure from all
errours, and by aduering to the Proteſtants, I am ſure to communicate with
a Church ſtayned with errours by their owne Confeſſion.</p>
               <p n="157">157. Secondly. I take an anſwer, from what you ſaied
aboue (Pag. 290. N. 88.) That, <hi>errours not Fundamentall are repugnant to
Gods command, and ſo in their owne nature damnable, though to thoſe which
out of invincible ignorance practiſe them, not vnpardonable.</hi> From
theſe words, I ſay, I will take an anſwer, if firſt I haue told you;
you ſhould haue ſayd, they are no ſins, and being no ſins, you ſhould
not haue ſayd, they are not vnpardonable, but the contradictory, they are
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, that is, they cannot be pardoned, or are not capable of 
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:59214:299"/>pardon; becauſe God cannot be ſayd to pardon that,
with which he was never offended, and pardon ſuppoſes an offenſe. This
very thing, is taught by yourſelfe (Pag: 19.) where ſpeaking of men who,
<hi>doe their beſt endeavours to know Gods will and doe it, and to free
themſelves from all errours,</hi> you ſay, <hi>So well I am perſwaded of
the goodnes of God, that if in me alone, ſhould meet a confluence of all
ſuch errours of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in the world, that were thus
qualifyed, I ſhould not be ſo much afrayd of them all, as I ſhould be to
aske pardon for them: For to aske pardon of ſimple and purely involuntary
errours is tacitly to imply that God is angry with vs for them, and that were
to impute to him the ſtrange tyranny of requiring bricke when he gives no
ſtraw; of expecting to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where he ſtrewed not; to reape where he
ſowed not: Of being offended with vs for not doing what he knowes we cannot
doe.</hi> Therfore, ſay I, and you muſt inferr the ſame, ſuch errours
are not capable of being pardoned; yea you account it a kind of ſacriledge,
to aske pardon for them. But yet to ſhew, how you are poſſeſſed with
a perpetuall ſpirit vertiginis, and contradiction to yourſelfe, I offer to
your conſideration, what (Pag: 308. N. 108.) you ſay of our pretended
errours: <hi>We hold your errours as damnable in themſelves as you do ours,
only by accident through invincible ignorance we hope they are not
vnpardonable.</hi> And (Pag: 290. N. 86.) Having ſpoken of the erring of the
Roman Church, you add; <hi>Which though we hope it was pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in them who
had not meanes to know their errour, yet of its owne nature, and to them who
did or might haue knowne their errours, was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly damnable.</hi> (Pag:
263. N. 26) You cite and approue the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Dr. Potter; that though our
<hi>errrours were in themſelves damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and full of great impiety, yet he
hopes, that thoſe amongſt you, who were invincibly ignorant of the truth,
might by Gods great mercy, haue their errours pardoned, and their ſoules
ſaved.</hi> What Mr. Dr., and <hi>Mr. Chillingworth?</hi> Is it great mercy
in God to pardon that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be any ſin? Is not this (to
vſe your owne words) <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly to imply that he is angry with vs for them,
and to impute to him the ſtrange tyranny of requiring bricke when he giues no
ſtraw &amp;c: of being offended with vs, for not doing, what he knowes we
cannot doe.</hi> A great mercy not to doe that, which were tyranny to doe; to
forgiue that which is no offenſe! But, as I am forced often to ſay, it is
no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, in you, to contradict yourſelfe.</p>
               <p n="158">158. Now I will performe what I promiſed; and ſhew,
that ſeing <pb n="579" facs="tcp:59214:300"/>invincible ignorance, in the opinion of all
Philoſophers, and Divines excuſes from ſin; if we can proue, that every
judicious man, having v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all diligence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, will find, that whoſoever joyning himſelfe
with our Church, ſhall be ſure, either not to erre, or at leaſt, not
vincibly, or culpably; the conſequence will be cleare, that ſuch errours
will not be damnable to any ſuch man, but that he will be aſſured of
ſalvation, for as much as belongs to matter of Faith: from whence it will
alſo follow, that none can ſeparate themſelves from the Church, without
dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Firſt then, I obſerue; That ſeing the Church,
(according to Proteſtants) cannot erre in Fundamentall Articles; for other
points not Fundamentall, whoſoever remaine in her communion, are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
vnder paine of damnation, to chuſe the more ſecure part, as they are bound
to doe, in matters abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate
medij, as <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> proves (Part: 1. Chap: 7. N. 3.) but it is
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for them, ad vitandum peccatum, for avoyding ſin, if they
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a judgment, truly probable, and prudent, in embracing all the
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular objects, which the Church propoſes to be believed: Becauſe they
are ſure by this meanes, not to erre in points abſolutely neceſſary to
ſalvation, (in which, the Church which they follow, cannot erre) nor to
ſin, in believing all other points, which ſhe propoundes, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
they proceede prudently; eſpecially, conſidering, as I ſayd, that in not
believing Her in all, they run hazard to disbelieue her in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Fundamentall
and neceſſary Article: which ſequele we haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, even in your owne
opinion, to be rationall.</p>
               <p n="160">160. This being obſerved; I now proue, that
whoſoever embraceth what the Church propoſes, and particularly for points
controverted in theſe tymes, proceeds very prudently, and ſafely. For, the
objects of Faith, ſurpaſſing the reach of humane reaſon, and for that
cauſe, being apprehended obſcurely by our vnderſtanding, do not bring
with them evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of demonſtration (to which we haue heard Hooker ſaying.
The mynd cannot chuſe but inwardly aſſent) but yet the vnderſtanding
may be forcibly drawne by the will, to embrace rather one part, than another,
vpon prudent reaſons, and extrinſecall conſiderations, which, not to be
wanting in our caſe, appeares by reflecting; That for the points
controverted, we haue the judgment, and Authority, of the Churches exiſtent
when Luther appeared, that is, of the vniverſall Catholique Church, if God
had any Church on Earth, as you grant he alwayes had: <pb n="580" facs="tcp:59214:300"/>And
even yourſelfe ſpeaking of Councells, ſay (Pag: 200. N. 18.) <hi>I
willingly confess, the judgment of a Councell, though not infallible, is yet
ſo farr directiue, and obliging, that without apparent reaſon to the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it may be ſin to reject it, at leaſt, not to affoard it an
outward ſubmiſſion for publike peace-ſake.</hi> Potter alſo, (Pag:
165.) Speaks fully, in theſe words: <hi>We ſay, that ſuch Generall
Councells as are lawfully called, and proceed orderly, are great and awfull
repreſentations of the Church Catholique; that they are the higheſt
externall Tribunall which the Church hath on earth; that their Authority is
immediatly derived and delegated from Chriſt; that no Chriſtian is exempted
from their cenſures and jurisdiction; that their decrees bind all perſons
to externall Obedience, and may not be queſtioned but vpon evident reaſon,
nor reverſed but by an equall Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that if they be carefull and
diligent in the vſe of all good meanes, for finding out the truth, it is very
probable the good Spirit will ſo direct them, that they ſhall not erre, at
leaſt not Fundamentally.</hi> Behold, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells are not only directiue, but
obliging; they cannot be rejected; <hi>Their Decrees bind to externall
Obedience, and may not</hi> (ſo much as) <hi>be queſtioned but vpon
apparent</hi> and <hi>evident reaſon; nor reverſed but by an equall
Authority; if they be carefull and deligent in the vſe of all good
meanes,</hi> for finding the <hi>truth, it is very probable, the good Spirit
will ſo direct them, that they ſhall not erre, at leaſt Fundamentally;
that their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is immediatly derived and delegated from
Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="161">161. Here it is reaſon I make a pauſe, and obſerue
ſome points out of our very Adverſaryes. Firſt, The vniverſall Church,
according to Potter and other chiefe Proteſtants, is infallible in
fundamentall points, and even according to <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hillingworth,</hi> is infallible as long as ſhe
exiſts; which he ſaith, hath been from the beginning, and ſhall laſt to
the worlds end: and ſo de facto ſhe is infallible, that is, he is as ſure
that ſhe ſhall not erre in any fundamentall point, as he is ſure, that
Chriſt ſhall alwaies haue a Church on earth; which ought to be a great
inducement not to reject her Authority, without evident reaſon. Yea ſeing
he holds Councells to be fallible in fundamentall points, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet that they
oblige men to an outward ſubmiſſion, much more he ſhould ſay ſo of
the Church, which is confeſſed to be infallible in all Fundamentalls.</p>
               <p n="162">162. Secondly: ſeing Potter, Chilling: and Dr. Lawd
(whom I cited aboue) teach, that we are bound vnder ſin, to affoard outward
obedience to Generall Councells, and that we cannot do this in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of
Faith, vnless we belieue as we profeſſe, we muſt belieue them to 
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:59214:301"/>be infallible in all things; leaſt either we ſin
againſt Obedience due to them, or, againſt our Conſcience, profeſſe,
what we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue.</p>
               <p n="163">163. Thirdly: ſeing their Authority is immediatly
derived and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated from Chriſt, their right to be obeyed, is de jure
Divino, of which they were in poſſeſſion when Luther aroſe, and
therfore it is a grievous ſin, not to obey them, vnless it can be
demonſtrated with evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they teach or command ſomthing clearly
repugnant to the law, or word of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="164">164. Fourthly: ſeing their Decrees cannot be
queſtioned, but vpon evident reaſon, it followes, that the reaſons are
not firſt purpoſely to be ſought, and then found, becauſe people
prepoſſeſſed by paſſion, haue a mind to breake with the Church, as
it happens in all Schiſmatiks, and Heretikes; but their Arguments muſt be
ſo preſſing, and irreſiſtible, by ceaſon of their evidence, that
the vnderſtanding cannot, by any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, of contrary reaſon, or command of
the will, forbeare to aſſent; which to any judicious man, muſt needs
appeare to be a ſtrange, and no better than an imaginaty kind of evidence,
and indeed impoſſible, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Faith, which are obſcure, and
exceed the naturall light, of all humane reaſon.</p>
               <p n="165">165. Fiftly. Since they cannot be reverſed, but by an
equall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (and Dr. Lawd delivers the ſame Doctrine, as we haue
ſeene aboue) we are aſſured, that the Decrees of Councells before Luther,
could not be reverſed by Luther, or any other private perſon, nor by all
Proteſtants; Who never could pretend to haue a Generall Councell, and in
thoſe Colloquiums, or Conferences, or particular Synods, which they held,
could never eſtabliſh, any vniverſall Vnion among themſelves, but only
declared to the world, that they had no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes of Vnion, and
Concord. And indeed, who ſhould call ſuch a Generall Councell? Or who
ſhould preſide therin? Or if they would haue recourſe to ſecular
Princes, it would make little to their purpoſe; ſeing abſolute Princes,
are no more ſubject one to another, than different Sects of Proteſtants,
will confeſſe any mutuall ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="166">166. Sixtly. Seing if they be carefull in the vſe of
all good meanes for finding the Truth, it is very probable the good ſpirit
will direct them, that they ſhall not erre, at leaſt fundamentally, they
could not be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, except by reaſon more than probable, but men were to
preſume <pb n="582" facs="tcp:59214:301"/>that they did not erre. Neither ſhould you
ſay; if they be carefull &amp;c. it is very probable the good ſpirit will
direct them, that they ſhall not erre (which may be ſaid of any two or
three, gathered togeather in Chriſts name, if they be carefull in the vſe
of all good meanes for fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the truth; yea the ſame may be ſayd, of
every particular perſon;) but contrarily, ſeing you confeſſe them to be
derived from Chriſt, and that they are the higheſt externall Tribunall,
which the Church hath on Earth: and that all are obliged to obey them (which
none could be, in errours againſt Faith) you ſhould ſay; becauſe they
cannot erre, God will not faile to affoard his effectuall Grace, that they be
carefull in the vſe of all good meanes for finding the truth. For accordingly
as God hath decreed to bring vs to an End, He will not faile to moue vs
effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to apply all thoſe Meanes which on our behalf are neceſſary
for ſuch an End. And it were but a moſt raſh, vncharitable, fooliſh,
and falſe imagination, to thinke that Generall Councells before Luther,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with men of learning, ſanctity, and zeale of the Truth, were
not carefull in the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of
all good meanes for finding the Truth: and therfore they could not but be
aſſiſted by God to find it, nor Luther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from Schiſme, and
Hereſy, by oppoſing them, and it.</p>
               <p n="167">167. Theſe things conſidered, it cannot but appeare
to any judicious vnpartiall man, how impoſſible it is, that any ſuch
evidence ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer itſelfe, againſt the Faith, and decrees of the
Church, or Generall Councells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as can force the vnderſtanding to an
aſſent in deſpite of any pious affection of the will, and reverence due
to Gods Church, and Councells, and the many and great reaſons which make for
Her: which is vnanſwerably confirmed, by conſidering, that Proteſtants
diſagree amongſt themſelves, and many of them in many things agree with
vs (which I muſt often repeate) which could not happen, if the reaſons
againſt vs, were demonſtratiue, or evident: and in this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your
Rule, that the property of Charity is to judge the beſt, will haue place, at
leaſt for as much as concernes thoſe your owne Brethren, who agree with vs:
As alſo your other ſaying (Pag: 41. N. 13.) That <hi>men ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and
vpright hearts, true lovers of God and truth, may without any fault at all
ſome goe one way; ſome another;</hi> which ſhewes, that there can be no
evidence, againſt the Doctrine of the Church, with which even ſo many
Proteſtants agree, but that Catholikes haue at leaſt very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and
prudent reaſons, not to depart from the Church in any one point; and that,
although we ſhould falſely ſuppoſe Her to erre in points 
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:59214:302"/>not fundamentall, the errour could not be culpable, nor
ſinfull, but moſt prudent, and laudable. And in this, our condition is far
different, and manifeſtly better, than that of Proteſtants, who
diſagreeing not only both from the Church, but amongſt themſelves alſo,
muſt be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that they are in errour, which for ought they know, may be
fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, ſeing they cannot tell what Points in particular are
fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall: wheras we adhering to the Church, are ſure not to erre
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any neceſſary or fundamentall truth. And yourſelfe ſay (Pag:
376. N. 57.) <hi>He that believes all neceſſary Truth, if his life be
anſwerable to his Faith, how is it poſſible he ſhould faile of
ſalvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="168">168. And then further vpon this ſame ground, is
deduced another great difference, with great advantage on our ſide; that
Proteſtants are obliged vnder paine of damnation, to make choyſe of the
more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and ſecure part, and muſt not be content, with a meere
proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, if they can by any induſtry, care, ſtudy, prayer, faſting,
almeſ-deeds, or any other meanes, attaine to a greater degree of certainty.
For, if indeed they erre in any one Article of Faith, neceſſary
neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate medij, they cannot be ſaved, even though their errour were
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be invincible, as hertofore we haue ſhewed out of
Proteſtants: Wheras we being aſſured, that, adhering to the Church, we
cannot erre in any point, of it ſelfe neceſſary to ſalvation, for the
reſt, we are ſure to be ſaved, if we proceed, prudently and probably,
becauſe the truth contrary to our ſuppoſed errours, cannot be
neceſſary neceſſitate medij, as not being fundamentall: Yea, ſince
indeed Proteſtants can haue no other true and ſolid meanes, of
aſſurance, that they erre not Fundamentally, except the ſame which we
embrace, of believing the Church in all her definitions, they are obliged vnder
deadly ſin, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue all that ſhe propoſes, for feare of erring in
ſome Fundamentall Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. What I haue ſayd, that we proceede prudently,
though our Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes were ſuppoſed to be errours, may be confirmed by an
Adverſary, Dr. Jer: Taylor; who (in his Liberty of propheſying (§. 20.
N. 2.) ſaieth; that <hi>our grounds, (that truth is more ancient then
falſhood, that God would not for ſo many Ages forſake his Church, and
leaue her in errour; that whatſoever is new, is not only ſuſpitions, but
falſe) are ſuppoſitions, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and plauſible enough.</hi> And then
having reckoned many advantages of our Church, he concludes; <hi>Theſe things
and divers others may very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perſwade perſons of much reaſon and
more piety, to retain that which they know to haue been the Religion of their
fore-Fathers, which had actuall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſesſion <pb n="584" facs="tcp:59214:302"/>and
ſeizure of mens vnderſtandings before the oppoſite profeſſions had a
name,</hi> (before Luther appeared.) And in express tearmes he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
that theſe things, <hi>are inſtruments of our excuſe, by making our
errours to be invinc1ible;</hi> which is the thing I would proue. But here I
muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that, when I ſay; It is ſufficient for vs to proceed
probably, and prudently; It is ſtill vpon a falſe ſuppoſition, that the
Church may erre in ſome Point not Fundamentall; though in reall truth there
be no ſuch diſtinction. For, we are obliged vnder payne of damnation, to
belieue the Church equally in all points, and vſe all, not only probable, but
poſſible meanes, to find the true Church, and belieue her, with abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
certainty, in all matters belonging to Faith; and in particular, That ſhe
cannot erre in any point Fundamentall, or not Fundamentall; without the beliefe
of which truth, Chriſtian Faith cannot be certaine and infallible, as hath
been ſhewed at large.</p>
               <p n="169">169. Thirdly. I anſwer to your Objection, That we
abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Catholique Church to be ſubject to errour, either in
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, or not Fundamentall Points; or that ſhe can erre, either
Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally, or damnably, in what ſenſe ſoever. And therfore, wheras
you ſay (Pag: 280. N. 95.) The <hi>errours of Proteſtants are not ſo
great as</hi> ours, we vtterly deny, that our Church can belieue, or propoſe
any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour at all. And though thoſe Catholique Verityes, which we belieue,
were errours, yet they could not be greater, than thoſe of Proteſtants,
ſpeaking in generall; ſeing in all the chiefeſt controverted points, we
haue diverſe chiefe learned men on our ſide, who think themſelves as good
Proteſtants, as thoſe other from whom they diſagree. Beſides, in our
Queſtion, reſpect muſt be had to the kind, and not to the degree of
errours, that is, nor whether the points be Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall or not Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
nor whether they which be Fundamentall, be greater or less in their owne
nature; nor whether one not Fundamentall, be worſe than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not
Fundamentall; becauſe if one errour not Fundamentall yield not ſufficient
cauſe to forſake the Communion of the Church, another cannot: otherwiſe,
you will not be able to aſſigne any Rule, when the Church may be
forſaken, and when ſhe cannor; and it is damnable to profeſſe,
againſt ones conſcience, any errour in Faith, be it never ſo ſmall:
which is the ground, for which you ſay, the Communion of the Church, may be
forſaken. And laſtly, it is more wiſdome, to hold a greater
vnfundamentall errour with the Church, which I know by the confeſſion of
our Adverſaryes, cannot erre fundamentally, than by <pb n="585" facs="tcp:59214:303"/>holding a less vnfundamentall errour, expoſe my ſelfe to danger
of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into fundamentall errours, as I proved hertofore: As it is less
evill to commit a veniall ſinne, that is, (which abſtracting from the
caſe of perplexity) would be certainly a veniall ſinne, than to expoſe
ones ſelfe to true danger, of falling into a mortall offence of God.</p>
               <p n="170">170. Fourthly; I anſwer, that as I haue often noted,
according to you and Dr. Potter, it is Fundamentall to the Faith of a
Chriſtian, not to deny any point, though otherwiſe of its nature not
Fundamentall, being propoſed, and belieued to be revealed by God; and ſo
your diſtinction between Fundamentall, and damnable Points, as if the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

your owne doctrine; Seing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever errour is damnable, is alſo
Fundamentall; and whatſoever is Fundamentall, is damnable, if we reſpect
the negatiue precept of Faith, obliging vniverſally, all perſons, in
reſpect of all objects, at all tymes, ſemper &amp; pro ſemper, as divines

of yours, it clearly followes, that culpably to deny any point, ſufficiently
propoſed, as revealed by God, implyes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety with this eſſentiall
and Fundamentall Article of Faith, that all Divine revelations are true; which
certainly is a Fundamentall Truth; and therfore all errours, that are culpable,
and damnable, are in this ſenſe, oppoſite to a Truth, which indirectly,
and by accident, and by conſequence, as you ſpeake, becomes Fundamentall.
The ſame you deliver (Pa: 197. N. 14.) where you ſay to <hi>Charity
Maintayned: I deny flatly as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thing deſtructive of it ſelfe, that any errour can be damnable,
vnless it be repugnant immediatly or mediatly, directly or indirectly, of it
ſelfe, <pb n="586" facs="tcp:59214:303"/>or by accident, to ſome truth, for the matter
of it, Fundamentall.</hi> Why then do you diſtinguiſh between damnable, and
Fundamentall errours? Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if every damnable errour (as you confess every
errour to be, which disbelieves any, ſufficiently propoſed, Divine Truth)
be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, every damnable errour deſtroyes the Eſſence, of a
Church, which you confess, cannot exiſt togeather with a Fundamentall errour,
and conſequently, the Church, cannot erre culpably, even in points not
fundamentall of themſelves, and remaine a Church: which is the thing we
teach, and you through your whole Booke deny, and are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to doe ſo, in
regard you hold that Chriſt hath always had a Church on Earth, and yet muſt
pretend, that ſhe hath erred, to ſaue yourſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves from the imputation of
Schiſme and Hereſy. The truth is: every ſinfull errour againſt Faith,
in a point of itſelfe never ſo ſmall, is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and deſtroyes
Faith, Church, and ſalvation; neither is there any difference, for the
generall effect of damnation, between errours in Points Fundamentall, and not
Fundamentall; and therfore it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the true Church can erre, in
either kind of ſuch points: becauſe it is impoſſible, that ſhe can
want any thing neceſſary to ſalvation, or be obnoxious to any thing
deſtructiue therof, and ſo, as I ſayd, for the Negatiue precept of not
disbelieving any thing, ſufficiently propoſed to be revealed by God, there
is no difference, between thoſe two ſorts of Articles: and the reaſon is,
becauſe the Formall object, or Motiue of our belief, is the ſame in them
both, namely, the Divine Revelation. But for the affirmatiue precept, of being
obliged to belieue explicitly ſome prime Materiall Objects of Faith, there is
difference, in regard that as ſuch Truths are Fundamentall, and neceſſary
to be actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ſo errours contrary to them, are moſt properly
Fundamentall errours, or errours, directly, and immediatly oppoſite to ſome
Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Object of Faith, Fundamentall of itſelfe, which every body ſees
doth not happen in all errours. Otherwiſe, how do you; Potter and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Proteſtants diſtinguiſh between errours in Points Fundamentall, and not
Fundamentall, if all errours be Fundamentall, or againſt a Fundamentall
truth? But you erre, by not diſtinguiſhing, or not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applying, the
diſtinction between the Affirmatiue; and Negatiue Precept of Faith; nor
between the Formall and Materiall Object therof. The Negatiue Precept ariſes,
from the Formall Object, it being vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, and intrinſecè
vnlawfull, to disbelieve any thing, inveſted with the Divine Teſtimony;
wheras the affirmatiue Precept, is taken from <pb n="587" facs="tcp:59214:304"/>the
Materiall Object of Faith; in regard that God hath commanded, ſome Truths to
be expreſſly knowne, and believed, as abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to
ſalvation. Vpon this erronious miſtake, youvnadviſedly find fault with
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in your (Pag: 197. N. 14.) for ſaying (Part: 1.
Chap. 3 N. 2.) That, errours may be damnable though they be againſt ſome
Points, <hi>for their matter and nature in themſelves not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,</hi>
(which are the preciſe words of <hi>Ch: Ma.</hi>) Where you ſee, he
ſpeakes of the Matter, or Materiall Object, and not of the Formall, of Faith
which is Divine Revelation; and ſo this Doctrine of his, is evidently true.
For, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s all Truths of Faith,
are not of their owne nature, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Truths, ſo neither can all
errours be fundamentall Errours. But, ſay you, the deny all of any revealed
Truth, for example, 
<q rend="margQuotes">of that of Pontius Pilates being judge
of Chriſt, is deſtructiue of this Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Truth, that, All Divine
Revelations are true.</q> I anſwer, as aboue that you erre by not
diſtinguiſhing between the Materiall and Formall Object of Faith, and not
conſidering, that fundamentall, or not fundamentall Truths, are not to be
diſtinguiſhed in order to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall object of Divine Revelation (which
being the ſame in all Truths all ſhould be fundamentall, or all ſhould
not be Fundamentall.) But as, I ſayd, that diſtinction is to be taken, from
the Materiall objects, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as ſome are more important, and more
neceſſary to be actually believed, than other. If any object; that this
truth, All Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are to be believed, is a thing which we belieue
as a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Truth; and therfore every errour againſt it, muſt be
Fundamentall; To this I anſwer, as aboue, that thoſe errours are
Fundamentall, which are directly, and immediatly oppoſed to Fundamentall
Truths; not thoſe, which only mediatly, and by conſequence, are ſuch.
Now, the errour directly oppoſite to this truth; All Divine Revelations are
true is this; All Divine Revelations are not true; which certainly is a
Fundamentall errour, as contrarily, errours oppoſed immediatly, and directly,
to Points not Fundamentall of themſelves, are not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall errours, in
the common ſenſe of that diſtinction: which were no diſtinction at all,
if every errour were equally oppoſite to a point, Fundamentall in
itſelfe.</p>
               <p n="171">171. You deſire <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> to
reconcile his doctrine, that errours may be damnable, though they be repugnant
to ſome point, for its matter and nature, not Fundamentall, with his other
ſaying (Part: 1. Chap: 4. N. 15.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Every Fundamentall errour muſt haue a
contrary <pb n="588" facs="tcp:59214:304"/>Fundamentall Truth; becauſe, of two
contradictory propoſitions, in the ſame degree the one is falſe, the
other muſt be true.</q> Indeed Sir, I know nor how to reconcile, thoſe two
ſayings of <hi>Charity Maintayned;</hi> becauſe I cannot ſee, how
poſſibly they could ever fall out or be at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. For, what
diſagreement can be imagined in theſe Propoſitions? Some errours are not
Fundamentall, as not being repugnant to Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall truths, and every
Fundamentall errours muſt haue a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fundamentall truth; or rather,
haue they not a moſt cleare connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and parity, that, as an errour, not
Fundamentall, is oppoſite on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a truht not fundamentall; ſo a
fundamentall errour is oppoſite to a fundamentall Truth? And the reaſon of
this, is given by <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> in that very place, which you cited;
becauſe, according to Philoſophy, 
<q rend="margQuotes">the privation is meaſured by the
forme, to which it is repugnant.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="172">172. Thus vpon the whole matter it appeares; That your
affirming our (falſely ſuppoſed) errours to be damnable, and ſo to
yield ſufficient cauſe, of deſerting our Church, is turned againſt all
Proteſtants, who confeſſedly, de facto maintayne damnable errours; That
although our errours were never ſo damnable in themſelves, yet they could
not be ſo to vs, who are excuſed by invincible ignorance; That Potter, and
you contradict yourſelves, in talking of pardon, for that which is no ſin:
and, That you overthrow your diſtinction of errours, which you ſay, are
damnable, but not Fundamentall, while in the meane tyme, you make all damnable
errours, to be fundamentall, and which for that cauſe (if you will ſpeake
with conſequence) muſt deſtroy the vnity of Faith, and Church, and hope
of ſaluation: And therfore ſeing you grant that there was a Church when
Luther aroſe, it followes, that indeed ſhe was not guilty of any errour,
even not Fundamentall; and that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his followers, were formall

make ſmall account of the Church, and Her Authority, and would haue ſuch an
equality, as might giue freedome for every one to follow his one fancy and
begin a new Church, and when all is done, to ſay; They divided not from the
Church, but one part from another, and they themſelves being one Part, may as

your definition, comes to be well connected, with your ſaying, That Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

a part of it, and they departed not from themſelves. Thus alſo you would
avoide, that vnanſwerable Argument of <hi>Charity Maint:</hi> (Part 1. Chap:

<q rend="margQuotes">That ſeing there was a Diviſion

that Church cannot be ſayd to haue divided herſelfe from him, before

but a part, we muſt ſay, that he divided himſelfe, and went out of Her:
Which is to be a Schiſmatike, or Heretique, or both.</q> Thus you may taxe S.
John (2. Jo: 19.) ſaying; they went out from vs, and aske why rather from vs,
that is, from the Church, than that they made a Diviſion of the Church,
dividing one part from another? But indeed your gloſſe cannot agree to S.
Johns text. For, theſe words, They went out of vs, do not only ſignify,

abſolutely impoſſible to make a Schiſme from the whole Church:
becauſe the part, which ſo divideth it ſelfe, doth ſtill remaine one

of the Church (which would be ridiculous) and not from her, as you ſay,
ſeing Hereſy alwayes involues Schiſme; and if Hetetiks alwayes ſeparate
from the Church, Hereſy, (which is the formall cauſe wherby they
ſeparate) muſt be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Church.</p>
               <p n="176">176. Now why do you not correct Scripture, Fathers,
Catholike Divines, learned Proteſtants, your client Potter, and yourſelfe;
as you take vpon you to controle <hi>Charity Maintayned?</hi> But either you do
not vnderſtand what Schiſme meanes, or els you would be very willing, the
world ſhould conceaue, there is no ſuch thing as Schiſme. For, if you did
conſider, that part which ſeparates from the Church, to be no Part. or
member therof, it were eaſy to ſee, that Schiſme may be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a
ſeparation from the Church, but not a ſeparation of one part, from another;
ſeing that by Schiſme, thoſe men, who once were a part of the Whole, and
com-parts with all the true members of the Whole, by Schiſme ceaſe to be a
part: As on the other ſide, Schiſme is a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <pb n="591" facs="tcp:59214:306"/>from the true Church, but not a dividing of the Church. And the
reaſon is, becauſe the Church is ſtill one in herſelfe, and ſo
Schiſme is alwayes a Diviſion from the Church taken formally as a true
Church, but never a diviſion of her, ſeing ſhe ſtill remaines One true
Church, and conſequently divided in herſelfe. Beſides, when diverſe
Parts conſtitute, or compound one Whole, the Parts cannot be divided one from
another, vnless they be conceived to be divided from the Whole, in order to
which, they haue the denomination of Parts. For, as long as they remaine with
one Whole, they remaine vnited with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Parts; and as it is
ſayd, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Quae ſunt eadem vni tertio, ſnnt
ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem interſe; ſo in proportion, quae ſunt vnita in vno tertio, ſunt
vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta interſe.</q> Therfore the vnion with, and ſeparation from the Whole,
is the meaſure of the vnion, or ſeparation of the Parts from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thus S. Thomas in the place alledged (2.2. Queſt: 39. Ar: 1. cor.) ſaith; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Propriè Schiſmatici dicuntur,
qui ſe ab vnitate Eccleſiae ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, quae eſt vnitas principalis. Nam
vnitas particularis aliquorum ad invicem, ordinatur ad vnitatem Eccleſiae:
ſicut compoſitio ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum membrorum in corpore naturali ordinatur ad
totius corporis v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem.</q> And vnless you take ſeparation of parts in
order to the Whole, you deſtroy all ſeparation, or diviſion. For, while
the parts are in the Whole, they are not divided, but vnited; And when they are
divided from the Whole, they are no more parts, in order to thoſe parts which
remaine in the Whole, of which they ceaſed, by the diviſion, to be
com-parts, but become Wholes, and can haue the denomination of parts, only by
Relation to the Whole, of which they were parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diviſion was
made; ſo as ſtill vnion with, or diviſion of parts which remaine in the
Whole, muſt be taken, as I may ſay, originally from the Whole: and it is
impoſſible, that two which haue been parts of one Whole, can be abſolutly
ſeparated from one another, and not from the Whole, with which if they
remaine vnited, they muſt alſo be vnited with one another, in illo tertio,
in that Whole, as I ſayd; And therfore diviſion of parts from one another,
muſt primarily ſuppoſe a diviſion from the Whole, and your ſingular,
Of, muſt de content to come after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of all Divines. All
ſeparation, properly taken, muſt ſuppoſe vnion; and parts, as parts,
muſt relate to ſome Whole. What I ſayd, is proved by your owne
definition, that, Schiſme is a diviſion of the Church, which muſt imply
that the Church is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; after which Diviſion, I hope you will not ſay,
that both the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <pb n="592" facs="tcp:59214:307"/>and innocent, the guilty and not
guilty parts ceaſe to be a Church, but that they only who without cauſe do
ſeparate, are cut of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church, and remaine no more a part of it.
Therfore their Schiſme is a Diviſon from the Church, and not a Diviſion
of the true Church, which ſtill remaines One true Church: as if a corrupt
part be cut of from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Body ſtill remaines one Whole, nor can
ſuch a ſection, or cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of, be rightly ſayd to be a Diviſion of the
Body (which ſtill retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes its VVholeness, as I may ſay, and denomination
of a Body) but of one part from the whole Body, and from the incorrupted Parts
which remaine conjoyned in it; yea the part cut of, and dead, ceaſes to be
ſo much as a part of that Body from which it is divided: and, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
properly, there is no diviſion of one part from another, ſeing that which
is cut of, ceaſes to be a part, except perhaps aequivocè. You
diſcourſe as of you ſpoke of a Diviſion of Genus into ſpecies, or of
quantity into parts, or in generall, of Diviſum, into membra dividentia,
where all ſpecies participate of Genus, every part of quantity, retaines the
ſame nature which it had before the diviſion; and in generall the Diviſum
is involued in every member of the Dividents; and ſo you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that
Schiſmatikes divided from the Church, remaine a part of the Church, as if the
Church were a Diviſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> divided into Obedient Perſons, and Schiſmatikes, as
into membra dividentia, wheras contrarily, the Diviſion we ſpeake of, is
not into, but from, that is, we ſpeake of a Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Church,
which alters the formality a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d condition of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is divided,
cauſing him to be no member of the Church, who formerly was ſuch.</p>
               <p n="177">177. But I ſuppoſe, that you, who will be broaching
a new Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, cannot faile to haue found out ſome new Reaſon, for your
Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as indeed I find your reaſon to be, and ſuch a one as is
not taught in any Logike, while you argue thus; <hi>I might deſire you to
conſider, whether Schiſme be not rather, or at leaſt, be not as well, a
Diviſion of the Church, as from it.</hi> VVhat I haue found by conſidering
your propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, my diſcourſe both in this place, and hertofore, will
informe you. But then, you come with another deſire: <hi>If you liked not
this Definition, I might deſire you to informe me in thoſe many Schiſmes,
which haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the Church of Rome, which of the Parts was the Church,
and which was divided from it.</hi> This is all your Argument, which I might
anſwer (as you confute the common Definition of Divines) by a
counter-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of myne, and ſay; I might deſire you to apply your owne
Objection to your <pb n="593" facs="tcp:59214:307"/>owne Definition, and informe me; in
thoſe Schiſmes which you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church of Rome, or any other
Schiſme, (for, your Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is common to all) which you ſay is a
Diviſion of ſome parts, from the other, which of the parts is
Schiſmaticall, and which not; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, which is the true Church,
and which the Schiſmaticall part. For I hope you will not ſay, That in
every Schiſme, the true Church looſes her Being of one Church, as the
Schiſmaticall part ceaſes to be a member therof: which Being if the Church
retaine, you muſt aſſigne which is the Church, and which is not the true
Church, but a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall member divided from Her; ſo that, your
Argument muſt be anſwered by yourſelfe: yea it will be harder for you to
anſwer, than for vs. For, of two diſagreeing parts, every one, as I ſayd
before, will thinke his right as good as that of the other, and it will not be
eaſy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which of them ſhould yield. But according to our
Definition, when we compare a part with the whole, it is eaſy to judge,
whether a part muſt yield to the whole, or the whole to a part: and for that
cauſe, we find no difficulty at all in anſwering your Demand, or Objection,
<hi>(In thoſe Schiſmes which haue happened in the Church of Rome, which of
the Parts was the Church, and which was divided from it)</hi> by ſaying; That
part was, and remained the Church, which was vnited to the true vniverſall
Church, and lawfull Head, thereof, which could be but one. Or, if you will
imagine, that for a tyme, it is not knowne, who is the true Head, and the
diſagreeing partyes proceed bona fide, and cum moderamine inculpatae tutelae,
prudently, and charitably; in that caſe there is no formall Schiſme, but
both parts remaine members of the vniverſall Church, and really vnited to
him, who is the true Head: Yea they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnited among themſelves mediate,
in aſmuch as they are vnited, in vno tertio, that is, to the true
vniverſall Church, and the true Head therof. And even this proves, that,
Schiſme is not formally a Diuiſion of parts, but from the whole; becauſe
two parts diſagreeing among themſelves, and ſo divided (if they be
conſidered as compared imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatily one with another) may be no
Schiſmatikes, if they be vnited in vno tertio, the Church, and Head of the
Church. Two parts may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the whole, and not be ſeparated
one from another, as the hand and arme cut of from the Body; but it is
impoſſible, that they can be wholy ſeparated from one another, if both of
them remaine Parts of One whole, in which therfore they muſt needs be vnited.
Thus, he who inculpably errs actually, againſt Divine Revelation, is really
vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="594" facs="tcp:59214:308"/>to it by preparation of mynd; and an implicite
beliefe of all things, which are ſufficiently propoſed to be revealed by
God. Contrarily, it is impoſſible that one can divide himſelfe from the
true Head, or from the whole, but that tacitè he muſt divide
himſelfe from the members, or Parts, which remaine vnited with the Head, and
with the whole; as it is impoſſible, that the hand can be divided from the
Body, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnited with the arme, if the arme ſtill remaine vnited
with the Body.</p>
               <p n="177">177. But you, whoſe principles giue full ſcope to
ſeparations and diviſions, loue not to heare of one Head, or one Church, or
ſucceſſion of Biſhops, or Obedience, and ſubordination, but of parts,
and parity amongſt all a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>by this definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you giue vs an

be knowne to be a Schiſmatike. Otherwiſe there will be no certaine Rule
Meaſure, or ground, to diſcover Hereſyes, or judge who be Schiſmatiks,
but-every part will looke vpon another, not as a Head, or Whole, or
ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but as a part and an Equall, which would be an endless ſourſe
of perpetuall Schiſmes, without any certaine meanes to convince either parte.
To which purpoſe, Baronius (Anno Chriſti 31. N. 51.) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts a memorable

the Jewes could ſhew a continued Succeſſion of Biſhops from the
beginning, till their tyme. And who ſees not, that for the ſame reaſon,

all that <hi>Mr. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi> hath alledged againſt the Arguments of
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in defenſe of the Doctour, the concluſion
muſt be, that Proteſtants are guilty of the moſt grievous ſins of
Schiſme and Hereſy, by forſaking the Faith, and communion of the
vniverſall Church, or of all Churc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes extant when Luther appeared, and
therfore, that Proteſtancy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented deſtroyes ſalvation.</p>

               <p n="169">169. Having then proved, that Chriſtian Faith is
abſolutely Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; that therfore ſome Infallible judge or Rule of
Faith is neceſſary; that, this cannot be Scripture alone; that, all though
Scripture did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all points of Faith neceſſary to ſalvation, yet
it could neither be a ſufficient Rule, nor any Rule at all of Faith, if the
errours which <hi>Mr. Chilling worth</hi> holds concerning it, were true; that
the Infallible Judge of controverſyes in Faith, muſt be the alwayes
viſible Church of God; that to oppoſe her doctrine, and forſake Her
communion is Hereſy, and Schiſme; that Proteſtants cannot be ſaved
without Repentance: Theſe things, I ſay, being proved, and every one of
them having ſuch connexion, that from the firſt to the laaſt one is
deduced from another by evident conſequences: We muſt now ſee, whether
<hi>Mr. Chilling worth</hi> though he hath not been able to defend
Proteſtants from the ſins of ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Hereſy; at leaſt, that
he hath taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome remedy, to obtaine pardon for thoſe, and all other
deadly ſins, by propoſing ſome true way to Repentance: and our next
Chapter ſhall ſhew, that the Repentance which he would teach them, is
neither ſufficient, nor poſſible, but plainly deſtructiue of itſelfe.

that Repentance, which you hold ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and neceſſary, is ſuch as
either in the way of Defect, or too little, or of Exceſſe and too much, no

960.) and even your opinion is, That, perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition will not ſerue,
without extirpation of all vicious habits, which you ſay, <hi>being a worke
of difficulty, requires tyme;</hi> and ſo you are ſingular in a matter vpon
which eternall ſalvation depends, agreeing neither with Catholikes (who teach
that Attrition is not ſufficient without Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and that, Contrition
alone in all tymes and moments is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) nor that contrition is ſufficient
without abſolution, as Kemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius holds, but you teach that no Repentance is
ſufficient, without the extirpation of all vicious habits, as we ſhall
ſee herafter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the thing itſelfe; I wonder what could bring you
to ſuch a Doctrine, as this: That an Act, which you confess (Pag. 32. N. 4.)
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Hope and Feare, could alone be a ſufficient diſpoſition,
for juſtifying Grace, and the Theologicall vertue of Charity, and Loue of
God. As well might you ſay, That an Act of Hiſtoricall Faith, is a
ſufficient diſpoſition for the vertue of Hope, and Hope for Charity, and
ſo Faith would come to juſtify: I ſay, an Hiſtoricall Faith, which no
Proteſtant holds can juſtify. But this is the worke of our common enemy, to
ſuggeſt Doctrines, which can produce no other effect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept damnation of
ſoules. For, to what other purpoſe can this your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ſerue? God is
always ready, to giue ſufficient Grace, for an Act of Contrition, when it is
neceſſary (as alwayes it is neceſſary for the Remiſſion of deadly
ſinnes, when Sacerdotall Abſolution cannot be <pb n="598" facs="tcp:59214:310"/>had)
and yet this your Doctrine, if once it be accepted for true, can haue no better
effect, than to make men rely vpon it, and not apply themſelves to an Act of
contrition, wherby they might be ſecure; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if your Doctrine be falſe
(as moſt certainly it is) whoſoever contents himſelfe with Attrition, for
remiſſion of any deadly ſin, ſhall infallibly be damned, even though we
ſhould ſuppoſe, that the beliefe of this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour were inculpable;
becauſe true Repentance is abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation,
neceſſitate medij: wherin invincible ignorance doth not excuſe; in which
caſe, every one is obliged, to embrace, not only a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but the moſt
ſafe, and ſecure part. And therfore this your errour, being againſt both
Catholikes, and Proteſtants, every one is bound, by the moſt ſtrict
obligation Charitatis propriae (which obliges vs to take the ſafeſt meanes,
for the ſalvation of our owne ſoules, in things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly neceſſary)
not to rely on your conceypt, but to procure that which is ſafe, either
contrition, or Attrition with Abſolution; and ſo your Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, can never
be practiced without a deadly ſin, though it were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be
probably true, as it is certainly moſt falſe. In ſo much, as D. Jeremy
Tailor, (In his Liberty of Propheſying, Pag. 252.) ſpeaking of ſome
Doctrines of vs Catholikes, which he ſaith, <hi>lead to ill life,</hi> he
ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyes this, that, <hi>Attrition (which is a low and imperfect degree of
ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin, or as others ſay, a ſorrow for ſin commenced vpon
any reaſon of temporall Hope, or feare, or deſire, or any thing elſe) is
a ſufficient diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a man in the Sacrament of Pennance, to
receiue abſolution, and be juſtifyed before God, by taking away the guilt
of all his ſins, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to eternall paines. So that already the
feare of Hell is quite removed vpon conditions ſo eaſy, that many men take
more paines to get a groat, than by this Doctrine we are obliged to, for the
curing and acquitting all the greateſt ſins of a whole life, of the moſt
victous perſons in the world.</hi> How contrary, in another extreme, is this
Doctour, to the choſen champion of Engliſh Proteſtants, <hi>Mr.
Chillingworth!</hi> But as for our Doctrine concerning Attrition, the Doctour
is extremely miſtaken, (to ſay no worſe) as will appeare to any, that
reads the ſacred Councell of Trent, declaring what ſorrow is required to
obtaine pardon of our ſins, or Catholique Divines writing on this ſubject.
For, if the ſorrow be conceyved vpon any Reaſon meerly of temporall Hope,
or feare, as the Doctour ſpeakes; we teach that it is in no wiſe
ſufficient to make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> capable of Abſolution, or forgiveness of ſins; but
it muſt proceed, from ſome motiue, knowne by ſupernaturall Faith; for
example, the Feare <pb n="599" facs="tcp:59214:310"/>of Hell, or deſire of heaven.
Secondly; it cannot be produced by the naturall forces of men or Angells, as
being the Gift of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the ſpeciall moon, inſpiration, and
grace, of the Holy Ghoſt: And therfore his examp, of gaining a groat, is ſo
farr from being to he purpoſe, or true, that

paines, and induſtry of all men, that haue bee, are, or ſhall be, yea or

of them all, though they were aſſiſted with the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

other naturall Creatures contayned in the Omnipotency of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.
Thirdly: ſuch ſorrow muſt extend itſelfe to all deadly ſins, in order
to which it is to be ſo effectuall, that it muſt exclude all affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to
them, and the Penitent m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Doctrine ſeemes to be contradicted by your ſelfe (Pag: 133. N. 12.) In
theſe words: <hi>For thoſe that haue meanes to find the truth, and will not

dangerous, yet if they dy with a generall Repentance for all their ſins,
known and vnknowne, their ſalvation is not deſperate.</hi> You ſeeme
either to ſpeake of men brought to the houre of death (or at leaſt you do
not exclude ſuch a caſe) and of men in ſtate of ſin, proceeding from
negligence to find the truth, which neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence muſt be cauſed by ſome
deadly ſinfull Feare, Hope, or ſome other vicious humane reſpect; and
conſequently, muſt haue produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſome vicious Habits, and yet you
ſeeme to ſay, ſuch men may be ſaved by a generall Repentance, which
being only generall, cannot deſcend to all particulars, as the mortification
of all particular ill Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits muſt doe; yea you ſuppoſe, that the
particular ſinfull errours, are not known to them; and much less, can thoſe
vicious Habits, from which they proceed, be mortifyed; which cannot be done at
that exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of imminent death: And therfore, either the doctrine, which you
ſeeme to teach, that it is poſſible for ſuch men to be ſaved at the
houre of their death, is falſe, or els you muſt grant, that Repentance
requires not the mortification of all vicious Habits.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Secondly: As I ſayd, of your Doctrine concerning the
fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſtian Faith, and of your Doctrine of Attrition, that they
could ſerue only to bring men to damnation; ſo I ſay of this your
Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that no ſinner who vnderſtands, and believes, it to be
true, can avoide deſperation, at the houre of death, when he ſees, that the
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of all vicious Habits, is impoſſible, and yet Neceſſary to
true Repentance and ſalvation of his ſoule. Proteſtants are wont to
receiue the Communion at the houre of their death, which, I ſuppoſe, you
will ſay, ought not to be done, without true Repentance of their ſins
(vnless you will ſuppoſe all Proteſtants, at the houre of their death, to
be free from ſin, which is againſt that, which Proteſtants themſelves 
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:59214:312"/>ſuppoſe, as ſhall inſtantly appeare) and yet it
is impoſſible for them, at that tyme, to attaine your Repentance, by
extirpation of all vicious Habits. In your Booke of Common-prayer, in the Order
of viſiting the ſicke, it is ſayd; <hi>Here ſhall the ſicke perſon
make a ſpeciall confeſſion, if he feele his conſcience troubled with
any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eighty matter.</hi>
Therfore, as I ſayd, Proteſtants may haue ſome weighty matter at the
houre of their death. And then is ſet downe the forme of Abſolution, which
the Ptieſt or Miniſter is to giue. But how can he who feeles his
Conſcience troubled with any weighty matter, truly repent at that laſt
houre, by your kind of Repentance, which you ſay is a worke of difficulty and
tyme? Or how can he be abſolved without true Repentance?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thirdly. This Aſſertion, is contrary to two
doctrines, very common, and as I may ſay, capitall amongſt Proteſtants,
that Faith only juſtifyes; and that it is impoſſible to keepe the
commandements. For, that Act of Faith, which they call juſtifying, and
remiſſiue of ſin, is exerciſed in an inſtant, and would ſaue a man,
though he ſhould dy, before it were in his power, to extirpate all vicious
Habits. And if it be impoſſible to keepe all the commandements, it is
impoſſible not to committ ſome ſinfull Acts, wherby they are broken,
and which muſt neceſſarily leaue after them, ſome vicious Habits, and
ſo inſteed of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpating all vicious Habits, men muſt ſtill be
producing new ones. How then can you ſay (Pag: 40<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. N. 31. <hi>Repentance is an
eſſectuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from all ſin to all holynes?</hi> Is not the
breaking of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements a ſin? Or can he be converted from all ſin,
to all holyness, and to vniverſall Obedience, as you ſpeake, who cannot
avoide ſin, but muſt ſtill be diſobeying?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Fourthly. In your doctrine, what ſhall become of
ſuch, as being newly converted to the Faith of Chriſt, from Paganiſme,
Judaiſme, or Turciſme, are baptized at the houre of death, and yet were
full of vicious Habits, which they haue no tyme to Mortify or roote out? Or
will you deny true Repentance, and Remiſſion of ſin, to thoſe who after
a life ledd in many grievous ſins, and after the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many ill
Habits, being ſuddenly converted to Chriſtian Faith, were baptized in their
bloud, before they could deſtroy ſo many vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Habits?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Fiftly. If you duly conſider what you ſay, you will
find your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Repentance, to be impoſſible, not only in the caſes
which I haue mentioned, but to thoſe alſo, who liue a conſiderable tyme,
after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <pb n="603" facs="tcp:59214:312"/>for their ſinnes) be it Attrition, or
Contrition.) For the Habits of vice as they were produced by frequency of acts,
ſo are they not taken away, but by multiplication of contrary acts. Neither
do they conſiſt in indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibli, ſo as if one degree be deſtroyed,
there may not remayne divers others, which muſt be rooted out, by little, and
little: and yet, while one habit is diminiſhed, or deſtroyed, another may
remaine entire, and even be encreaſed: for example, while the habit of
injuſtice is deſtroyed, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, the habit of intemperance, or
impatience, or timidity, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, as they were, vntouched, or elſe growe
to be more intenſe, by acts of thoſe vices. Nay, who doth ſo perfectly,
and totally, vpon the very firſt onſet, relinquiſh any one vice, that he
is not, morally ſpeaking, ſubject to be committing ſome one act, or
other, of that former vice, wherby the Habit will returne to receiue ſome
increaſe? And then how large a ſpace of tyme, may chance to ſlip away
before the Habit of one, (and much more of all vices) be perfectly rooted out?
Eſpecially if it be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly radicated, and ſeconded, and abbetted, or
rather prevented, by ſome inclination, ariſing from complexion, temptation
of the divell, bad examples, falſe principles of the world, and other ſuch
cauſes, which make the committing of ſin obvious, and eaſy; wheras the
contrary acts of vertue not only find great reſiſtance, for the reaſons
now mentioned, but alſo becauſe they are of themſelves of a ſublime
nature, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re great purity of intention, without mixture of profit, or
pleaſure, or tincture of ſelfeloue; which vniverſall conjuncture, and
perfect harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of all good circumſtances, is ſo neceſſary, that the
want of any one, be it never ſo ſmall, depraves the whole Action, and
deprives it of the nature, and denomination of being vertuous. All which
decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, how hard it is, to exerciſe a true Act of vertue, and eaſy to

ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrâ cauſa, malum ex quocunque defectu. To all which, if we add
that which I declared in the Introduction. That, one whoſe ſins are not
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and conſequently is not in ſtate of Grace, cannot hope to avoide
deadly ſin, for any long tyme (and ſo will be acquiring, or increaſing
vicious Habits) it will appeare too clearly, how hard it is, and how much tyme,
induſtry, conſtancy, and application, and aboue all, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticylar Grace of
God is neceſſary to extirpate all the Habits of all vices; and that
ſinners though never ſo full of harty ſorrow for their ſins, muſt
remaine in a perplexed, afflicted, and deſperate condition, for feare of 
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:59214:313"/>dying, before they haue arrived to your new kind of
Repentance, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes impoſſible, and alwayes vncertaine; as will more
appeare by what I ſay</p>
               <p n="10">10. Sixtly: I would demand, what Rule you, or any man,
can poſſibly giue, to diſcerne, and prudently judge, when a ſinner hath
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to that degree of extirpating all vicious, and acquiring al vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Habits, which is ſufficient and neceſſary for true Repentance, ſince in
Philoſophy, naturall contrary Habits, may remaine togeather, in ſome
Degree; and much more if they be not contrary, but only different or
diſparati, they cannot deſtroy one another; and it is impoſſible to
know, what Degrees they hold, or which, or how little, or how much, or how many
of them are deſtroyed: eſpecially if we reflect, that they may remaine in
their nature, and being, and yet not diſcover themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, or appeare
ſenſibly, and experimentally, for want of occaſion; or by reaſon of
attention to other objects; or diſpoſition of body, as ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness &amp;c:
or affections of the mynd, by Feare, Hope Joy, Sorrow, and the like; and even
one vice, may be occaſion, that another appeares not, or if one of them
deſtroy another, as prodigality, avarice, it is by producing, or
encreaſing, a contrary vicious Habit, wherby the party may ſeeme to moue,
and yet not goe forward; change, but not to the better, and perhaps to the
worſe: and ſo your Repentance muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, of vncertaintyes, and
like that of Judas, more fitt to bring miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, perplexed ſinners to the
halter, than to Heaven. You object, and even vpbraide to Catholiques, their
making men vncertaine of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by requiring intention in the miniſter
of Sacraments; which I haue ſhewed, to be an irrationall, vncharitable, and a
meere panick feare. But indeed this Doctrine of yours, which requires for true
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, conditions oftentymes impoſſible, and alwayes
vndiſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whether they be performed, or no, doth really put men, vpon
true and grounded, feare, and perplexityes, and occaſion of deſperation. It
is true, the beſt Divines teach, that a ſinner is not bound to repent
himſelfe inſtantly of his ſin; ſo as he commits not a new ſin, if he
do it not; becauſe we ſind no poſitiue law of God, impoſing any ſuch
obliga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion; and he is aſſured by Scripture, that God will not deny pardon,
at whatſoever tyme, or inſtant, he is cordially ſorrowfull for his
ſins, with an effectuall purpoſe of amendment. But if he did forſee, that
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he repented preſently, it would grow impoſſible for him ever to
repent, for example by reaſon of death, or madness: in that caſe he 
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:59214:313"/>were obliged to repent inſtantly, both by obligation of
the precept of Repentance, which, if ever, obliges in that caſe; as alſo by
the precept charitatis propriae, of charity as it reſpects a mans ſelfe,
which binds him to provide for the Salvation of his owne ſoule. Now ſeing
whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commits a deadly ſin, doth by that Act, vnavoidably produce
ſome degree, of a vicious Habit, which may conſiſt with one, yea with
many degrees, of the contrary naturall Habit of vertue, and morally ſpeaking,
will ſtill be receiving increaſe or addition, by many new Acts, which a
ſinner, deveſted of juſtifying grace, as I ſayd, is prone to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt;
it followes, that no man can poſſibly haue any rationall, and ſolid way
to judge (but muſt remaine practice vncertaine) whether he ſhall ſooner,
come to an end of Repentance, or of his life, in your way. And therfore, not to
put his ſoule into ſo great vncertainty, and hazard, what would remaine,
but that he be obliged to repent, as ſoone as the ſin is committed: though
even this he can hardly do, according to your Doctrine, becauſe he may
exerciſe an Act contrary to that particular ſin, and yet ſome degree of
the Habit therof remaine, vnless he exerciſe ſo intenſe an Act of vertue,
that it produce an Habit ſo intenſe, as no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the contrary vicious
Habit can ſtand with it; which is both a very rare thing, and when it
happens, it ſtill leaves you vncertaine, whether it hath happened, or no: and
therfore the more your Doctrine is diſcuſſed, and examined, the more
dangerous, pernicious, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, it appeares to be, in many
reſpects.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Seavently. In this Queſtion, three ſorts of
Habits, or, as it were Habits, are carefully to be diſtinguiſhed: Which,
while you confound, you do but deceaue the Reader. Firſt: After the actuall
committing of any deadly ſin, there remaines in the ſoule, habituall ſin,
wherby one is ſayd to be a ſinner, to remaine in ſin, to be in ſtate of
ſin, deprived of juſtifying Grace, an enemy to God, and deſerving
eternall damnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Habituall ſin, is not any permanent, reall,
phyſicall, poſitiue Habit, or Quality, but a kind of morall denomina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,
or ground therof, which remaines, after the Act of ſin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, till it
be retracted, and reverſed, by true Repentance, that is, by harty ſorrow
for ſins paſt, with a firme purpoſe, never to offend God mortally for
tyme to come. Thus even amongſt men, when one hath offended another, by
ſome injurious Act, there remaines in the deliquent, a morall denomination of
a perſon injurious, and an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſatisfaction, for obtaining
pardon from the perſon wrongfully of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: <pb n="606" facs="tcp:59214:314"/>Which
permanent morall denomination, cannot formally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, in any reall or
phyſicall habit, or Quality, ſeing it is cleare, that the pardoning ſuch
an offence, doth neither produce, nor deſtroy any reall Quality, or entity,
in the offender, who may be pardoned in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ſo receave no new,
nor looſe any former, reall entity. If the former injurious action, produced
any vicious Habit, yet the remaining or not remaining, of ſuch a Quality, or
Habit, is wholy impertinent, to the forgiveness, or pardon granted by the
wronged party, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives the injury, without knowing, or caring, whether
any naturall phyſicall Quality, do, or may remaine (which is the worke of
Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to diſcuss) his motiue to pardon, being the morall
retractation of the injurious action by a contrary demeanour, ſubmiſſion,
ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and ſorrow; which being once duly perfomed, and accepted, if
any reall entity, or habit chance to remaine, it is deveſted of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
relation to any Act, as it was injurious, and offenſiue; ſeing that Act is
retracted, and revoked, and therfore remaines no more voluntary in the
offending perſon: as if we ſuppoſe one to haue ſhot an arrow, or caſt
a dart, with purpoſe to kill another, and to be inſtantly by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
motion of the Holy Ghoſt ſtrooken with effectuall ſorrow, and Repentance,
before the ſhaft arriue to the party againſt which it was levelled, the
wounding or killing, in that caſe, will indeed be ſayd, to proceed from the
hand, which diſcharged the dart, in nature of a reall naturall effect, but
not in the nature of a voluntary, morall ſinfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſince all that
which was voluntary and ſinfull, is ſuppoſed to haue beene retracted by
true repentance, before the effect was produced. This which we haue declared,
by the example of one man, compared to another (that the Habituall offenſe,
or injury, conſiſts not in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Habit, or Quality, but in a morall
conſideration) holds much more, if we transferr it, to the Habituall
offenſe, of man, againſt God, who though de facto he be pleaſed to
forgiue ſin, vpon our Repentance, yet, conſidering the thing in itſelfe,
he could not be obliged, to forgiue our ſin, though our ſorrow were never
ſo perfect, and though we were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to extirpate all vicious
Habits, by the contrary naturall Habits of vertue, but beſides all this, and
all that can be imagined to be done by vs, there is required a mercifull, and
free condonation from his infinite Goodness (whether by infuſing Grace, or
otherwiſe, I do not diſpute for the preſent) without which our ſinns
are not forgiven: wherby it clearly appeares, that the denomination of being an
Habituall ſinner, <pb n="607" facs="tcp:59214:314"/>or to be in ſtate of ſin,
conſiſts not in any reall Quality, or Habit, ſince theſe may be
deſtroyed, and yet habituall ſin remaine, and theſe may remayne, though
habituall ſin be taken away; as likewiſe if we ſuppoſe, Almighty God to
hinder miraculously, the production of any reall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, or Qualityes by not
affoardingh his vniverſall free concurrence or cooparation, without which no
ſecond cauſe can produce any action, or reall habits; yet whoſoever
commits a ſinfull action vnavoidably, is, and is denominated, a ſinner,
till he repent. Therfore it is manifeſt, that habituall ſin, or ſin
remayning Habitually, conſiſts not in any reall phiſicall habit, or
quality, and conſequently, habituall ſin, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, though the vicious
habit, either be deſtroyed, or never exiſt. Which ſhewes; that your
Repentance, by rooting out all vicious habits is impertinent to true
Repentance, and forgiveness of ſins.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The ſecond kind of habits, which belong to our
preſent purpoſe, are reall, phyſicall, and naturall Qualityes, or habits
of vertue, orvice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by vertuous or vicious Acts, which acts being
immediatly volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and produced by our free-will, are in themſelves good
or bad; vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or vertuous; deſerving prayſe or diſprayſe; reward or
puniſhment. But good, or bad, habits, are not voluntary in themſelves, but
only in their cauſes; for as much, as they were produced, by voluntary free
Acts, which produce habits, no less neceſſarily, than fire produces heat,
in a matter capable, and approximated; nor is it in the power of man, to
exerciſe Acts, good, or bad, and forbid, or hinder them, from produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
vertuous, or vicious habits. When therfore a ſinfull Act, is once effectually
retracted, by true Repentance, the habit which proceeded from it, and was
voluntary, only in its cauſe, or ſinfull Action, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines now no more
voluntary, to that repentant ſinner, but retaines meerly its, as I may ſay,
innocent, reall nature, and entity, being in itſelfe a dead Quality, and no
more a ſin to ſuch a one, than ſickness, or death, was to Adam, after his
fall and repentance, that is, effects of ſin, not ſin. They may perhaps
facilitate, and incline to Acts, which may proue ſinfull, yet that
facilitation, and provocation, being not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, but purely naturall, is of
itſelfe no ſin at all: As the naturall inclination which men haue to
certaine Objects, may be occaſion of ſinfull Acts (if the will giue free
conſent) yet is not of itſelfe any ſin, nor voluntary vnto vs, but
naturall, and may be occaſion of great merit, if bad motions proceeding from
it, be reſiſted by our will aſſiſted by Gods Grace. And you might as
well ſay, that Repentance requires <pb n="608" facs="tcp:59214:315"/>the deſtruction of
our nature (I meane, that naturall inclination, which Divines call Fomes
Peccati, from which, ſinfull Acts may proceed, and which in Adam proceeded
from his actuall ſin, which deprived him of Originall Juſtice) as you
require the abolition of all Habits, inclining to ſin, and produced by
ſinfull Acts, which being retracted by Repentance, the Habits, or effects of
them, can retaine no reliſh or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them as they were voluntary,
free, and ſinfull: For which cauſe, ſuch Habits, haue now nothing to doe,
with any ſin, either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, or habituall; and therfore it is
impoſſible, that they can haue any leaſt repugnance, with juſtifying
grace, Sanctity, Charity, and Loue of God, and conſequently, true Repentance
cannot require their des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction, ſeing their exiſtence is compatible,
with grace, and Sanctity. Beſides, if the Acts by which one vitious Habit is
deſtroyed doe not of themſelves deſtroy any degree, of ſome other
vicious Habits, with which, thoſe Acts haue no connexion; much less, can
juſtifying grace be incompatible, with any naturall acquired Habits of vice,
theſe being of an inferiour nature, and order to that; and therfore habituall
ſin, with which grace and Sanctity cannot ſtand, conſiſts not in ſuch
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall acquired ill habits; neither can the extirpation of them, be
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to true Repentance, which may take away the ſin, though
thoſe habits remaine. Morover the acts wherby ſome vicious habit is
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, may deſtroy ſome contrary vicious habit; as for example, Acts of
Prodigality, tend to the deſtruction of the habit of Avarice (and the ſame
may be ſayd of all other vices, which are Extremes in order to the meane of
vertue:) But it is abſurd, and impious to ſay, or imagine, that habituall
ſin can be forgiven by any ſinfull Act, ſince no habituall ſin, can be
taken away without Repentance, which being a ſpeciall ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Gift
of God, cannot be a ſin: Therfore we muſt affirme, that, reall Qualityes,
which we call habits, are not habituall ſin; otherwiſe ſin might be
pardoned by ſin. Which is further confirmed, by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that vicious
habits, may be expelled immediatly and formally by naturall habits, and mediate
by Acts, wherby the habits of ſuch vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are produced: For example, The
habit of Injuſtice by the Contrary habit of Juſtice, and ſo other vices
by their contrary vertues, habits, and Acts. And therfore, if habituall ſin
conſiſt in reall Qualityes, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of vice, ſin ſhall be forgiven
formally by a forme, or Quality, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit acquired by Acts produced by force
of nature, which (being but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall) yet ſhall be vltima diſpoſitio to
ſupernaturall infuſed juſtifying <pb n="609" facs="tcp:59214:315"/>Grace; which is
both abſurd, and the wicked hereſy of Pelagius. Laſtly It is a certaine
truth, that whoſoever departs this life, in any one dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin,
vnrepented, cannot be ſaved. And it is alſo true, that ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall
ſin, may consiſt with ſome naturall precedent habits of vertue, which are
not expelled by every deadly sin, ſeing ſuch a deadly ſin may be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in ſome matter, which hath no connexion at all with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of
thoſe naturall habits of vertue, and therfore ſuch a sin ſhall not expell
ſuch habits of morall vertues, as de facto it doth not expell, even the
ſupernaturall habits of the Theologicall vertues, Faith, and hope. And if
habituall ſin may ſtand with naturall, yea and with ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
Vertues, what reaſon can be imagined, but that habituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and
Sanctity, may conſiſt with the ſimple entity or nature of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
habits, being cleared, by Repentance, from all former relation of being effects
of ſinfull Acts, by which they were produced? And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently; true
Repentance which is a diſpoſition to the infuſion of grace, may
conſiſt without the extirpation of the habits, ſeing grace it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe may
ſtand with them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The third kind of Habits, I call, infuſed Habits,
of the three Theologicall vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, which haue for
their immediate object, God himſelfe, who is our laſt End; and infuſed
Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of morall vertues, which reſpect or haue for their Objects, the
Meanes, which bring vs to that End. Now, for the production, or in fuſion of
ſupernaturall Habits, we may diſpoſe ourſelves, by voluntary
ſupernaturall Acts, produced by the particular Aſſiſtance, of the Holy
Ghoſt; but the Habits themſelves, are produced and infuſed into our
ſoules, immediatly and only by God, and not Phyſically, and really
produced, by any even ſupernaturall Acts of ours, as naturall Habits are
acquired and produced by our naturall Acts. And as our ſoule, which is a
ſpirit, and the life of our body, is created by God alone, ſo no wonder if
juſtifying Grace which is the ſpirituall life and ſoule of our ſoule,
be infuſed by God, not produced by vs. This difference ariſeth, from the
diverſity of nature, between naturall, and ſupernaturall, or Infuſed
Habits. Naturall Habits do preſuppoſe, a Power, or Ability to produce
certaine Acts, and Habits are ſuperadjoyned to the ſame Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, for
producing thoſe Acts, with greater promptitude, and facility. But
ſupernaturall Habits, not finding in our ſoule, a power to produce, of it
ſelfe, ſupernaturall Acts (for how could they be ſupernaturall, if they
could be produced by naturall forces?) giue vs ſuch power and 
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:59214:316"/>Ability; and therfore in rigour of ſpeech, ſhould
rather be called Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, than Habitus, Powers, than Habits. For which
cauſe I ſayd, Three ſorts of Habits, or as it were Habits, ought to be
diſtinguiſhed in this Queſtion. For. Habituall ſin is, as I may ſay,
less than an habit, being no reall, or Phyſicall Quality; the infufed habits,
are more than meere habits; they are Powers, as I haue declared. Naturall, or
acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red habits, being reall Qualityes on the one ſide, and on the other,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing in vs, a Power to worke without them, are really, properly,
and purely habits. It is therfore, eaſy to vnderſtand the reaſon, why our
Acts cannot produce ſupernaturall habits, which giue vs Power to produce
ſuch Acts, it being a cleare caſe, that no effect can produce that, which
of its nature is the very Power to produce, or the Efficient Cauſe, in
reſpect of ſuch Effects, which Cauſe muſt be preſuppoſed
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent, and in being, before it can produce ſuch an Effect. Otherwiſe,
there would be a mutuall cauſality, and dependance, between the firſt
production of the Cauſe Efficient, and the effect therof; the Cauſe would
be the effect of its owne effect, and the Effect would be the cauſe of its
Cauſe; as if the Father ſhould be ſon to his ſon, and the ſon father,
to his owne Father.</p>
               <p n="14">14. From this Ground: That ſupernaturall habits are
Powers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, our ſoule is not only weake, or infirme, but
abſolutly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to produce any ſupernaturall Act, and therfore cannot be
acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or produced by any Acts of ours; there followes another difference;
That, naturall acquired Habits, yield as it were a ſenſible facility,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, experience, and feeling of themſelves, by remooving
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, diſpoſing the Organs of our Body, and other ſuch wayes. But
thoſe other Habits, giving vs the firſt Ability, and Power, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in
their nature eſſentially ſupernaturall, are not diſcernable by
ſenſible experience, but may well conſiſt with vicious Habits, and with
the facility, or inclination which they affoard towards their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Objects; as it happens not ſeldome, that a man, who in the ſight of God, is
more holy by ſupernaturall Grace, is carryed with a more vehement
inclination, or impulſion to ſinfull Objects, either by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
complexion, or vicious Habits, acquired before his converſion, than another,
made of a different conſtitution of body, or clogged with fewer vicious
Habits: which greater propenſion to ſin, is ſo far from being any ſin
of itſelfe, that it gives continuall matter, of greater merit, by frequent
combats, and victoryes.</p>
               <pb n="911" facs="tcp:59214:316"/>
               <p n="15">15. And here I would aske, whether, if you hold the
habits of vice to be habituall ſins, even after an Act of Contrition, or
Sorrow with a firme purpoſe to amend, you muſt not likewiſe belieue,
naturall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Habits of vertues, to be juſtice, and Sanctity, in the
ſight of God? And yet this were direct Pelagianiſme, evacuating the fruite
of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Satisfaction, and merit; and is in itſelf manifeſtly
vntrue. For the End to which God hath elevated, and ordained Man, being
ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall (the Beatificall Uiſion, or enjoying God in his Glory) the
Meanes, which bring vs to that End, muſt alſo be ſupernaturall, and not
to be compaſſed by our naturall forces; and therfore naturall Habits of
vertue, acquired by our owne Acts, cannot be true Sanctity, and Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
which make vs capable of the Beatificall Uiſion, nor can that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
which diſpoſes vs for Heaven, conſiſt in the extirpation of vicious
Habits, in which Habituall ſin doth not conſiſt, as Sanctity doth not
conſiſt, in naturall Habits of vertue. Neither may it ſeeme ſtrang,
that you ſhould belieue Sanctity to conſiſt in the acquired ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of
Uertue; who hold Chriſtian Faith, to be no more than a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſent;
or Concluſion, deduced by naturall reaſon, from Premiſes evidently apt to
inferr ſuch a Concluſion; As alſo, who ſpeaking of Charity, ſay (Pag:
368. N. 49.) <hi>It is againſt reaſon and experience, that by the
commisſion of any deadly ſin, the Habit of Charity is quite
extirpated.</hi> By which you giue to vnderſtand, that you belieue the habit
of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be produced by our Acts, and to be deſtroyed by little and
little, (as it happeneth in naturall acquired habits) and that the preſence
of it, may be diſcovered by experience, which agrees only to naturall
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, working in vs by a kind of experimentall way: Wheras, if you did
belieue, the habit of Charity, to be ſupernaturall in eſſence, not
produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible by our Acts, but infuſed by God, for enabling vs, to loue his
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty aboue all things, you would eaſily ſee, that it could not
be deſtroyed by parts, but all togeather, and that only in caſe of
commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a deadly ſin, wherby the ſinner, in fact voluntarily prefers
ſome creature before God, his Creatour, and therby ceaſeth to loue him
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things, which yet is eſſentiall to Charity, and without which it
cannot exiſt in any leaſt degree. Holy Scripture tells vs, he that loves
not, remaines in death; which declares, that Charity is the life of the
ſoule; and de dly ſin being the death therof, if Charity may ſtand with
deadly ſin, the life and death of the ſoule, ſhould abide togeather. But,
as I ſayd, it appeares by this, that you diſcourſe of the Theologicall
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true <pb n="612" facs="tcp:59214:317"/>of Charity, as of naturall acquired habits,
produced by our Acts, may be encreaſed, diminiſhed, produced, and
deſtroyed without any like alteration in the habits of the infuſed vertues,
which are of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature, and higher kind. And by this appeares how
neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it was, to premiſe the Introduction, concerning the infuſed
habits, and neceſſity of Grace.</p>
               <p n="16">16. In the meane tyme, every one may ſee, that either
you make ſmall account of Scripture, which yet you pretend to be a totall
Rule of Faith, or els, that it is not cleare, even when it ſeemes to ſpeake
moſt cleare. For, what principle is more received in Chriſtianity, or more
evidently ſet downe in Scripture, than that by true, and harty Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a
ſinner doth inſtantly obtaine pardon of his ſins? And yet you deny this
firſt principle, and as it ſeemes, can ſee no ſuch evidence in
Scripture concerning it. The Proteſtant Church of England once ſo termed)
at the beginning of their morning Prayer, hath this ſentence, (out of the
Pſalme 51. according to their account) a ſorrowfull ſpirit is a
ſacrifice to God; and that out of S. Luke (15.18.19.) of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall

S. Baſill (Homil: de penit) ſaith of him: Caeperat dicere, &amp; mox illum

<q rend="margQuotes">In eo momento totius vitae peccata
abſtergit: In that very inſtant the ſins of his whole life were wiped
away. Thus we reade (Ezech: 33.12.) The juſtice of the juſt ſhall not
deliver him, in what day ſoever he ſhall ſinne: and the imprety of the
impious ſhall not hurt him, in what day ſoever he ſhall convert fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his
impiety.</q> Therfore, as a juſt man doth inſtantly looſegrace, by his
ſin, ſo a ſinner repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, doth preſentlyobtaine pardon of his ſin,
and lives by juſtifying grace, God being more ready to pardon, than puniſh.
And no wonder; ſeing a ſinner performes all that is in his power, for that
inſtant: And god requires of vs, no more than is in our power, nor can he
ſeriouſly command impoſſible things (as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly confeſſe
(Pag: 390. N. 7.) in theſe words: <hi>The Rule of the Law is alſo the
dictate of common reaſon and equity, that no man can be obliged to what is
impoſſible. We can be obleged to nothing but by vertue of ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
Now it is impoſſible that God ſhould command in carneſt any thing which
he knowes to be impoſſible. For to command in earneſt is to command 
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:59214:317"/>with an intent to be obliged which is not poſſible he
ſhould doe, when he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, the thing commanded to be impoſſible.</hi>
Theſe I ſay, be your words, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they are very true, but directly againſt
the common doctrine of Proteſtants, that it is impoſſible to keepe the
commandements of God (who ſurely commanded them in Scripture in good
earneſt, and not in jeaſt,) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any moment wherin a man
indued with the vſe of Reaſon, may not avoide eternall damnation, if he
cooperate with Gods grace, which is never wanting; nor can there be any moment,
wherin a man may not hope to be ſaved. It is a true Axiome of Divines,
facienti quod in ſe eſt, &amp;c: God doth not denye his Grace to him, who
doth all that lyes in his power, aſſiſted by grace. I ſayd, A ſinner
doth all that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in his power at that inſtant. For, if he ſurviue, he is
obliged to keepe all the Commandements, which oblige vnder mortall ſin: but
this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, is not a part of Contrition or Repentance, but only the
Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject therof, for as much, as Contrition implyes an effectuall purpoſe, of
keeping the Commandements: And for that cauſe the ſame Prophet (Uerſ:
14.15.16.) ſaith; If I ſhall ſay to the impious: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Dying thou ſhallt dye;</q> and he do
pennance from his ſin, and do judgment and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and the ſame impious
reſtore pledge, and render robbery, walke in the Commandements of life, and
do not any vnjuſt thing: living he ſhall liue and ſhall notdy. All his
ſins, which he hath ſinned, ſhall not be imputed to him: he hath done
judgment and juſtice, living he ſhall liue. This appeares in the
converſion and juſtification of David (2. Reg: 12.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">who repenting, had ſcarce vttered two
words, I haue ſinned to our Lord,</q> when he heard of the Prophet: Our Lord

witneſſeth, (Pſalm: 31. V. 5.) I ſayd: 
<q rend="margQuotes">I will confess againſt me my
injuſtice to our Lord: and thou haſt forgiven me the impiety of my ſin.
Vpon which place S. Auſtine ſpeaking in perſon of David, ſaith: my

<q rend="margQuotes">Not ſo much the meaſure, or quality
of tyme, as of ſorrow, is to be conſidered: For, God doth not deſpiſe a

Pſalme: do of themſelves proue our Aſſertion. So that, Scripture,
Fathers, and Theologicall reaſons, do all concurre in this, that effectuall
ſorrow for ſins paſt, with a firme Reſolution to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend for tyme to

Booke, and conſiſts in this: That, one who lives in a ſinfull errour
againſt faith, may be ſaved, by a generall Repentance of all his ſins
knowne, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, though he do not forſake that culpable errour, but
liue and dy in it. In your Anſwer to the preface of <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> (Pag: 7. N. 3. you approue the ſaying of Potter, <hi>that
both ſides, by the confeſſion of both ſides, agree in more Points than
are ſimply and indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation, and differ
only in ſuch as are not preciſely neceſſary: That it is very posſible
a man may dy in errour and yet dy with repentance, as for all his ſins of
Ignorance, ſo in that number, for the errours in which he dyes: with a
repentance, though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite and particular: which is not ſimply

cannot but hope, conſidering the Goodness of God, that the Truths retained on
both ſides, eſpecially thoſe of the neceſſity of Repentance from dead

               <p n="18">18. About which words, it is to be obſerved: Firſt,
that as I noted aboue, you and Potter confess, that Catholiks hold more Points
of Faith than are neceſſary to ſalvation; ſo that the Points in which
we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from Proteſtants, which you call errours, are not neceſſary;
and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly you teach (Pag: 9. N. 7.) that, men may be ſaved though they
hold the doctrines of Indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, Purgatory, and the vſe of Latine 
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:59214:318"/>Service. And therfore I may turne againſt you, your
owne words (Pag: 220. N. 52.) <hi>May it pleaſe you therfore, now at laſt
to take notice, that by Fundamentall, we meane all, and only that which is
neceſſary: and then I hope you will grant, that we may ſafely expect
ſalvation in a Church which hath all things Fundamentall to ſalvation;
Vnless you will ſay, that more is neceſſary, than that which is
neceſſary.</hi> Theſe words I ſay, proue that we may even ſafely (for
that is your word) expect ſalvation in a Church, which by confeſſion of
all ſides, believes more Points than are neceſſary, <hi>vnless you will
ſay, that more is neceſſary, than that which is neceſſary;</hi> or,
that we belieue not as many Points as are neceſſary, though we belieue more
than are neceſſary. Secondly: That, as I noted before, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
yourſelves in ſaying, That by the goodness of God, the Truths retained on
both ſides, may be an antidote againſt the errours of <hi>ſuch as being
diligent in ſeeking Truth, and deſirous to find it, yet miſſe of it by
humane frailty, and dy in errour.</hi> For, the errours of men, ſo qualifyed
as you deſcribe them, muſt needs be invincible; if invincible, no ſins)
if no ſins, how can any truth be an antidote againſt them? Or how can; the
doctrine of neceſſity of Repentance from dead works, concerne works, which
are not dead, that is, no ſinnes, nor can be the Object of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or
capable of pardon? I beſeech you remember your owne express words (Pag: 16.
N. 21.) <hi>The very ſaying they were pardonable, implies they needed pardon,
and therfore in themſelves were damnable.</hi> How then do you ſay, that
inculpable errours, may be pardoned by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Repentance? Or how do you in
particular, agree either with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks, or Proteſtants, about the
neceſſity of Repentance of dead wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, ſeing you diſagree from both
of them, in declaring what Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is neceſſary? Thirdly: (Pag: 8. N.
3.) you ſay the Doctour <hi>gives them only hope of pardon of errours, who
are deſirous, and according to the proportion of their opportunityes and
abilityes, induſtrious to find the Truth, or at leaſt truly repentant, that
they haue not bene ſo.</hi> In which words you diſtinguiſh thoſe,
<hi>who are deſirous and induſtrious to find the truth</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe,
who are <hi>repentant that they haue not been ſo:</hi> The former ſort of
which men, are not capable of Repentance, becauſe they committed no ſin.
And if the ſecond be truly repentant, (as you ſuppoſe they are) that
<hi>they haue not been deſirous and induſtrious to find the Truth,</hi> you
ſuppoſe they know that they haue not been ſo. To whom then ſhall belong
that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which you call generall and implicite of all errours, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
and vnknowne? Fourthly; Howſoever you endeavour to anſwer theſe 
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:59214:319"/>contradictions, it ſeemes you are conſtant, that a
ſinfull errour may be pardoned, though one liue and dy in it: And then,
Fiftly, The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which I ſpoke of aboue, comes to vrge you: How
ſuch a man can attaine your kind of Repentance, at the houre of his death,
when it is impoſſible. But let vs goe forward.</p>
               <p n="19">19. (Pag: 21.) you ſay; <hi>If any Proteſtant or

ſinfull and damnable: yet not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſiue of all hope of ſalvation, but
pardonable if diſcovered, vpon a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar explicite Repentance, if not

<hi>Voluntary and avoidable fault, and in its owne nature damnable,</hi> You
ſay: <hi>If the party ſo erring, dy with Contrition for all his ſins
knowne and vnknowne (as his Errour can be no impediment but he may) his Errour
though in itſelfe damnable, to him, according to your Doctrine (Charity

Antidote.</hi> In theſe and other paſſages of your Booke, you teach, that
a ſinfull, and damnable Errour (for of ſuch we muſt ſpeake, when we
ſpeake of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to object wherof his ſin) may be forgiven, while one
remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in ſuch an Errour, or without relinquiſhing it; which is a moſt
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious errour, and deſtructiue of itſelfe. For, if his errour be
ſinfull; it is not, becauſe he ſees it to be an errour, and yet
perſiſts in it; which is impoſſible, ſeing that to judge a particular
errour to be an errour, is to forſake it and embrace the contrary truth,
becauſe an errour diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is deſtroyed; neither is it an errour, but
a true judgment, to judge that an Errour is an Errour, according to the
ſaying of S. Auſtine (Lib. 15. de Trinit: Cap: 10.) Nemo falſa novit,
niſi cum falſa eſſe novit. Uerum eſt enim, quod illa falſa ſint.
No man can be ſayd to know falſe things, except by knowing they are

of higheſt moment, which is that vnum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarium, that one
neceſſary Thing, of which our ſaviour ſpoke, and to which, all other
things are to be referred, and therfore requires our chiefeſt, and vtmoſt
endeavour, and all that may any way put it in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, ought inſtantly to
ſtrike vs with a moſt deepe fright, and move vs <pb n="617" facs="tcp:59214:319"/>to

                  </gap> by reaſon of pride,
confidence in his owne witt or judgment, or the like ſinfull cauſe, which
muſt be knowne and voluntary, in order to ſuch an errour, and ignorance;
otherwiſe they could not be ſinfull, as we haue ſeene out of your owne
words, that we cannot be obliged to that which is not in our power. Now, if the
cauſe of ſuch errour be ſinfull, and voluntary, to ſay, one may be
pardoned of that ſin, without actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally forſaking it, is to ſay: A ſin
may be repented, and forgiven, while one is actually perſiſting in the
committing of it, and ſeing to pardon a ſin, is to deſtroy it, and to be
committing it, is to conſerue it in being, ſin ſhould be deſtroyed, and
conſerved; be and not be, at the ſame tyme; which is a manifeſt
contradiction.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But you ſay, The ſinner may haue Repentance of
all ſins kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne, and vnknowne. I anſwer: You are in a great errour, or
inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, both concerning the nature of ſin, and of Repentance; in
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that either can ſin be committed without all knowledge, or
that true Repentance can extend it ſelf to a ſin, of which one is in Act of
vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary committing it. For, how doth he effactually deteſt, and with his
whole hart repent himſelfe of it, if he be yet voluntarily committing it? And
as for the other part: All ſin is voluntary, and neceſſarily
preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſome kind of knowledge therof to proceede in the
vnderſtanding, without which, it were not voluntary, nor vincible, nor
culpable, but neceſſary, and invincible, or no ſin at all. Which being
true in all ſin, much more muſt it be ſo in deadly, and damnable ſins,
(as you affirme errours againſt Faith to be) which require full knowledge,
and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration when they are firſt committed. And this is particularly
true in the ſubject of which we ſpeake; in regard, that our good God
(whoſe will is that all ſhould be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of
Truth) never failes to be frequently preventing, illuminating, moving, and
ſtrongly inciting the ſoules of men to embrace the true Faith, Religion and
church, within which he hath confined ſalvation, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is continually
ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo lowd as he may be clearly heard, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly, as every
one muſt confess himſelfe guilty, if he do not obey, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a voyce
ſo ſweet forcible, and Divine. And therfore your Contrition of all ſins
knowne and vnknowne, comes to be a meere ſixion, or illuſion; your
Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſins which one is actually committing, to be a plaine
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and both of them, to containe a moſt pernicious Doctrine. To
compriſe all this matter in few words: When you ſpeake of ſins not 
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:59214:320"/>knowne: if the ignorance be invincible, it is no ſin:
if vincible, and culpable, it doth not excuſe from ſin the Errour which
proceeds from it; and therfore cannot be forgiven, as long as one is committing
it, no more than other ſins againſt Gods Commandements, for example,
hatred, deſire of revenge &amp;c. And how can want of knowledge, excuſe
one, who either ſins by that very want of knowledge, or that want of
knowledge, is the effect of his ſin, that is, of culpable neglect to learne;
as a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e want is not
excuſed from the rot, by ignorance, proceeding from his voluntary neglect to
ſtudy.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Perhaps ſome may ſay; I haue proved
ſufficiently, that no Proteſtant, or other Sectary, can haue true
Contrition of ſins, wholy vnknowne, or when it is committing them, or while
he hath tyme to amend them, neglects to doe it. But the difficulty may ſeeme
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, what is to be ſayd of a Proteſtant, at the point of death, if
he come to be particularly contrite, of his former culpable negligence, to
ſeeke the true Religion (but now hath no tyme to diſcuſſe particular
Controverſyes) with a firme reſolution, to embrace that Faith which, if God
ſpare him life, he ſhall, by his Divine Aſſiſtance, find to be true.
To this doubt, I</p>
               <p n="22">22. Anſwer, Firſt, That ſuch a one cannot,
according to your Doctrine, hope for Salvation, which is never granted, without
true Repentance, and this cannot be had; at that moment of death. when there is
no tyme to roote out all vicious Habits, which cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be
few, in perſons, who for worldly reſpects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haue not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſeeke
out the true Religion, on which, every Chriſtian belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, the ſalvation
of his ſoule to depend. Secondly: This caſe or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition yields as
much as Charity Maintayned intended to proue, That, a formall Proteſtant
cannot be ſaved, if he perſiſt in Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. For, he who is
hartily ſory that he hath neglected to ſeeke the true Faith, Religion, and
Church, and conceives an obligation to haue vſed more diligence therin: doth
clearly doubt, whether the Proteſtant Religion be true, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>by is no more a Proteſtant,
than he can be a Chriſtian, who doubts, whether Chriſtian Religion be true,
it being a true Axiome in Divinity; dubius in ſide eſt infidelis, He who
doubts of his Faith, is an infidell. The reaſon is; becauſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Divine Faith is infallible, and certainly true, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cannot
conſiſt with any deliberate, or voluntary doubt; neither doth Chriſtian
Faith, belieue any Article of Faith with greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, 
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:59214:320"/>than that itſelfe is certaine. Whoſoever therfore
doubts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proteſtants Faith, and Religion, be true, ceaſes to be a
Proteſtant, or to belieue Proteſtant Religion to be true, with that firmnes
of Faith, which is required for Salvation. And although ſuch a pertinent
ſinner, be not a Catholike, by the actuall beliefe of thoſe Points,
conceruing which he hath no tyme to be particularly inſtructed, yet he is
really and actually a Catholike by believing in voto or deſire, whatſoever
the Church teaches, and thoſe errours of his, which before were culpable,
only by reaſon of ſome culpable cauſe, or neglect to ſeeke the truth,
while he had tyme to doe it, after true, and effectuall Contrition of ſuch a
ſinfull cauſe remaine errours materially only, and no ſins, till it be in
his power to examine and reverſe them; juſt as vertuous perſons, in the
true Church, may by invincible ignorance hold ſome errour againſt Faith,
till they be better inſtructed. And ſo the finall Concluſion will be,
that he who effectually repents his ſin, committed in omitting cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably to
ſeeke the true Church, and hath no poſſible meanes to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine matters,
may be ſaved, not by a generall but by a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition; not of
ſins vnknowne, but knowne: not remaining a formall Proteſtant, but being a
reall Catholike, having retracted the former ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his ſin, and
believing in deſire, all that the Catholike Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and ſo he is
a Proteſtant neither in act, ſeing he doubts of the Proteſtant Religion,
nor in voto or deſire; which is to be a profeſſed member of the true
Church, and to imbrace the truth, and forſake all Errour, as in this
preſent Queſtion, we expreſſly ſpeake of the errours of
Proteſtants, and enquire whether they can be ſaved with ſuch errours, as
likewiſe our ſuppoſition, for the preſent is, that the Roman is the
true Church, and ſo the Uotum or deſire, of ſuch a penitent, is to
forſake the Doctrine of Proteſtants, and to embrace the Religion of the
Roman Church. But then, if ſuch a one ſurvine, and come to haue tyme
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for ſeeking, and finding out the truth, and neglect to doe it,
he waxeth recidivous and falls into a new ſin, and his e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ours grow againe to be ſinfull by reaſon of
their new ſinfull cauſe.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Your example, that poyſon will not poyſon him
that receives with it a more powerfull Antidote, is either de ſubjecto non
ſupponente, as if the poyſon of ſin could ſtand with the Antidote of
Contrition; or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a manifeſt falſhood, and contradiction, if you
ſuppoſe, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, can deſtroy that ſin, which one is
committing. Naturall or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall poyſon, may ſtand with an Antidote, but
ſin, the poyſon of <pb n="620" facs="tcp:59214:321"/>the ſoule, cannot ſtand with
Contrition and ſo ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> helpe no more, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Antidote not receyved, can

powerfull Antidote, than the poyſon of your objection, which therfore I hope
will not poyſon any, that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves with it the Antidote.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Thirdly, I anſwer, by denying abſolutely the
caſe which was propoſed; that he who hath ſinfull errours, at the houre
of his death, can haue true Contrition; without actuall direliction of them. My
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is; becauſe Contrition, being a moſt ſingular Gift of the Holy
Ghoſt, as I proved in the Introduction, and including the perfect loue of
God, is an infallible Diſpoſition to Juſtifying Grace; as therfore, God
in his holy Providence, hath decreed, that after baptiſme, in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courſe, or de lege ordinaria, none ſhall be ſaved, out of his Uiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church, ſo he gives not his effectuall Grace to exerciſe an Act of
Contrition in the Will, before he endue him with true Faith in the
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that as his errours were repugnant to Faith, ſo his
Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and retractation, may rectify them, by the contrary Truths of
Faith. For this cauſe, the Apoſtle, after he had ſayd, God will haue all
men ſaved, which words ſignify the End, adds, and to come to the knowledge
of truth, as the Meanes, to ſuch an End. And this being the ordinary
courſe; in vaine is it, to diſpute what God may doe de po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia
abſoluta, by his abſolute Omnipotency, or whether there be any phyſicall,
or Metaphyſicall repugnance, between Contrition, and Errours per ſe
loquendo damnable; ſince thoſe matters wholy depend on Gods free will, and
holy pleaſure, which we cannot know, by Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, humane demonſtrations,
but only by Revelation, wherby God hath declared in generall, that for
Chriſtians, there is no ſalvation, without profeſſing the Faith of his
Uiſible Church: and for vs to put ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, to that generall Rule, can
haue no other effect, than to make men negligent in ſeeking the Truth, in
tyme, vpon hope, that they may be ſaved with Errours againſt Faith, at the
houre of their death, when indeed it will proue too late. Neither can it be
objected, that at the houre of death, it is not poſſible to examine
particular Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes, and none can be obliged to an impoſſible
thing. For, the anſwer is eaſily given, out of what we haue already ſayd.
Firſt, that this ought not ſo ſeeme ſtrang to you, whoſe kind of
Repentance is impoſſible, at <pb n="621" facs="tcp:59214:321"/>that houre of death, as
I haue often ſayd; and ſo we may apply againſt you, your owne words (Pag:
390. N. 7.) <hi>They that confess their ſins and forſake them, shall find
mercy, though they confeſſe them to God only, and not to men. They that
confess them both to God and men, if they do not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually and in tyme
forſake them, ſhall not find mercy.</hi> Now by your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine men cannot
forſake their ſins in tyme, who haue not tyme for rooting out all vicious
habits, and therfore ſhall not find mercy. But by the way; what evidenct
Scripture haue you, that they ſhall find it who confess their ſins only to
God, ſeing, ſome Lutherans, and other Proteſtants hold, and other confess
that it was the Doctrine of ancient holy Fathers, that, private confeſſion
of ſins, is commanded by God? and we haue heard Kemnitius teaching, that even
Contrition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abſolution, is not ſufficient for pardon of ſins,
either in act, or in deſire; and your reſolute ſpeech to the contrary, is
an affirmation, without any proofe. Neither can Contrition be ſufficient,
vnless it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a firme purpoſe to performe all that God hath commanded,
wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Confeſſion of deadly ſins is one. Secondly I anſwer, that, as
God is ſuppoſed at that tyme to infuſe perfect contrition, and change the
will, ſo alſo you ſhould ſuppoſe that he rectifyes the
vnderſtanding, and the ſame meanes which he vſeth for the one, he may
vſe for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether he doe it immediatly by himſelfe, or by the
miniſtery and helpe of ſome ſecond cauſe, as a catechiſt, or
inſtructour, or good bookes to ſtirre vp the ſpecies, and then God may
giue his grace to belieue; and it would be incomparably more ſtrang, that God
ſhould giue Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to Chriſtians remayning out of his Viſible
Church for matter of Faith, than to cleare their Errours, ſuppoſing he will
giue them Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though indeed in our caſe, there can be no true
Repentance, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less all ſinfull errours be rectifyed,</p>
               <p n="24">24. That which you alledge out of the Prophet David,
aboccultis meis munda me, cannot ſignify, that ſin can be committed without
ſome knowledge, as even Socinians confess, but only that ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by
culpable ignorance, are not wont to moue vs ſo much to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation and
ſorrow, as thoſe which are committed with full knowledg; and therfore
thoſe hidden ſins require a more particular light, and Grace of God, to
preſent them to our ſoules ſo clearly and effectually, as we may be
perfectly ſorrowfull for them in particular, and not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved with ſuch
a generall, ineffectuall, ſorrow, as you obtrude, without dereliction of the
ſins, of which men, pretend to repent.</p>
               <pb n="622" facs="tcp:59214:322"/>
               <p n="25">25. And now, I hope it appeares, vpon examination of your
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular errours, concerning Repentance; that you make it either
inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, by your pretended neceſſity of extirpating all vicious
habits; or contradictory and deſtructiue of itſelfe, by holding a
Repentance, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the actuall committing that ſin, for which one
repents: And therfore, that Proteſtants cannot hope to be ſaved, though
they ſhould dy with your Repentance: and conſequently that not only
Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy vnrepented, but even repented, in your manner, is deſtructiue
of ſalvation; which is more than hitherto hath bene ſaied, and ſhewes
what a choiſe champion you are for Proteſtants, and howe vnadviſed, or
partiall they are, who ſo exceſſively cry vp your Booke.</p>

EXAMINED.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving in the precedent Chapters, endeavoured to draw
into Heads, the moſt vniverſall and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Points, handled in
Mr. Chilling worths Booke, either particular to him, or common to
Proteſtants; it remaynes only, that according to the method held by
<hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> in his Anſwer to Dr. Potter, we touch ſome
particulars, which perhaps did not neceſſarily, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, offer
themſelves, in thoſe generall Heads, and yet muſt not be omitted by me,
if it were but for taking away all ſuſpicion, or aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that any
thing hath beene purpoſely diſſembled, as impoſſible to be
anſwered; though it be very true, that all difficultyes of moment, haue been
conſidered, and examined in the former Chapters. And therfore it ought not to
be expected, and much less exacted, that I ſpend much tyme, in this
particular Survey of every parcell of His Booke, being ſufficient, that the
Reader be referred, to thoſe ſeverall places, wherin his Sophiſmes are
diſcovered, his reaſons confuted, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections anſwered, forque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
contradictions layed open. I will anſwere his Chapter in order, as they lye,
having firſt begun with his anſwer to the Preface of <hi>C: M.</hi> And
ſo now I begin to address my ſpeech to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In your (Pag: 6. N. 2.) you accuſe <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> as perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſtate of the Queſtion, which, ſay you,
<hi>was not whether Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Proteſtants can be ſaved in their
ſeverall profeſſions, but whether we may without vncharitableness,
affirme, that Proteſtancy vnrepented deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyes ſalvation.</hi> But this
is a difference, without any reall diſparity. 
<q rend="margQuotes">For, <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> and
Catholikes, believing in their conſcience that the Religion which they
profess, is true, and the contrary falſe, Dr. Potter muſt not take it ill,
af Catholiks belieue they may be ſaved in that Religion for which they
ſuffer;</q> as <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſaieth: <pb n="624" facs="tcp:59214:323"/>(Part. 1. Pag: 27. N. 1. and Part. 1. Pag. 36. N. 17.) this, I ſay
being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it followes, that, we muſt either belieue Proteſtancy
vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to deſtroy ſalvation; or els, that both Catholikes, and
Proteſtants may be ſaved in their ſeverall profeſſions. For if this
laſt were once granted, then Proteſtants might be ſaved, though it were
proved, that our Religion were true. And therfore all the proofes of
<hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> muſt be reſolved into this Queſtion; whether
both Catholiks, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants can be ſaved. Which anſwer is of it
ſelfe ſo obvious, that your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did perceiue it; and therfore you ſay
to <hi>Charity Maintayned. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may it be ſayd that your Queſtion here
and myne, are in effect the ſame,</hi> ſeing <hi>it may be true that you
and we cannot both be ſaved: And yet as true, That, without vncharitableness
you cannot pronounce vs damned. As, though Iewes and Chriſtians cannot both
be ſaved, yet a Iew cannot juſtly, and therfore not charitably, pronounce a
Chriſtian dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Which is a very ſtrange ſpeech, as if you would
haue Catholikes not belieue Catholique Religion to be true; which if they
belieue, it followes that Proteſtants cannot be ſaved, vnless <hi>both
Catholikes and Proteſtants may be ſaved,</hi> and therfore you had no
reaſon to ſay, that the Queſtion was not, <hi>Whether, both Catholikes
and Proteſtants may be ſaved.</hi> For this cauſe <hi>Charity
Miſtaken</hi> gives this very title to his ſixt Chapter: <hi>That, both
Catholikes and Proteſtants cannot posſibly be accompted of one and the
ſame Religion, Faith, and Church.</hi> And the Title of his tenth, and laſt
Chapter: is: <hi>A recapitulation of the whole diſcourſe</hi> (marke,
<hi>of the whole diſcourſe) wherin it followes vpon the confeſſion of
both partyas, that the Catholikes and the Proteſtants, are not both of them
ſaveable in their ſever all Religions.</hi> Thus (to turne your owne
example directly againſt you) ſuppoſing <hi>Iewes and Chriſtians cannot
both be ſaved,</hi> a Chriſtian who believes Chriſtian Religion to be
true, may juſtly, and charitably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a Jew damned. In like manner,
<hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> (Chap: 2. Pag: 15.) ſaith expreſſly, That, as
Catholikes <hi>ſo long as they belieue their Religion to be true,</hi> muſt
belieue Proteſtancy vnrepented to deſtroy ſalvation ſo (ſaith he)
<hi>the ſame muſt they alſo belieue of vs, if indeed they belieue their
owne Religion to be true Chriſtian Religion, of which, Chriſt himſelfe
pronounced,</hi> Qui non crediderit, condemnabitur. And why muſt
Proteſtants ſay of vs, as we ſay of them, but becauſe (as I alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
out of the Title of his laſt Chapter) <hi>Catholikes and Proteſtants are
not both of them ſaveable in their ſeverall Religions?</hi> And therfore
the whole diſcourſe of <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> was not ſo much to
proue in particular, <pb n="625" facs="tcp:59214:323"/>the truth of Catholike Religion, and
falſhood of Proteſtantiſme, as that, (ſuppoſing Catholike Religion be
true) it is no vncharitableness, to belieue, and profeſſe, that,
Proteſtants cannot be ſaved, without Repentance, and that, Proteſtants
muſt ſay the ſame of vs, if the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir Religion were true; and ſo all the
Queſtion is reſolved, finally, and formally, into this, <hi>Whether both
Catholikes and Proteſtants can be ſaved in their ſeverall Profesſions,
as Charity Maintayned affirmed it to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. After this; (N. 3.) you endeavour to proue out of Dr.
Potter, that he anſwered directly to that Queſtion which <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> propoſed; becauſe the Doctor teacheth, that men of
different Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be ſaved by repentance of all their ſins of
ignorance. But by your leaue, the Queſtion is; whether men of different
Religions, can be ſaved, if they liue, and dye, in that difference, without
repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For he who repents his errour, or the culpable cauſe therof,
ceaſes to be formally of that Religion, of which he was, before ſuch his
repentance; in regard that he who doubts in his Faith, is an infidell, in
reſpect of that Faith, as I declared aboue; and even yourſelfe ſay (Pag:
25. N. 29.) <hi>He that would Queſtion whether knowing a thing and doubting
of it, may ſtand togeather, deſerves without Queſtion, no other Anſwer,
but laughter.</hi> Your numbers (5.6.7.) containe nothing not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
already.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In anſwer to your (N. 8.) I ſay, as hertofore, that
Potter ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes ſeemes to affirme, that it is damnable to disbelieue any
Point, ſufficiently propoſed, as revealed by God: But yet, that both he,
and other Proteſtants do, and muſt, contradict that their affirmation, in
diverſe reſpects, as I proved aboue at large, and therfore whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he
ſeemes to ſay in one place, being contradicted by himſelfe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
is to be reputed as never ſayd, in order to any other effect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this
only, that no regard is to be had, what he ſaith, either in the one, or the
other, of thoſe places: And therfore <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> had reaſon
to ſay, that in this particular he never touched the Point really, ſeing he
himſelfe deſtroyes, what himſelfe might ſeeme once to haue builded.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All that you haue (N. 10.) is anſwered, by ſaying,
that it is damnable, not to belieue, any leaſt Point, which the Church
propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be a Divine trurh, that is, as revealed by God; till which tyme,
one may erre, without Hereſy. Now, to determine what Points in particular be
ſo propoſed, were to run overall particular Articles of 
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:59214:324"/>Faith: Yet to your inſtances, I anſwer briefly: The
Quarta decimani, who held, that Eaſter was to be kept according to the Rite
of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, were juſtly condemned of Hereſy, not preciſely for the
Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Tyme, but for the ground of that Aſſertion, that it was
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to doe ſo; which would haue brought with it, a neceſſity
of keeping all the Rites of the Jewes. And therfore you ſay vntruly, that,
<hi>God had not then declared himſelfe about Eaſter.</hi> But the keeping
of Chriſmass day, ten dayes, ſooner, or later, goes vpon no ſuch ground.
For, I never heard, that the Jewes kept our Saviours Nativity, either according
to the new, or old Calendar. As for believing that there are Antipodes; if you
can produce any Text of Scripture, or definition of Gods Church, I will hold it
a matter of Faith. Sure I am, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reaſon, not to produce
ſuch impertinent examples as you doe. The ſame I ſay of Predetermination;
that what the Church ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, will become a matter of Faith. The
example of Millenaryes, and neceſſity of Euchariſt for Infants (which
laſt you vntruly Father vpon S. Auguſtine) you are ſtill obtruding vpon
vs, without proving what you ſay: as alſo that S. Auſtine did not hold it
as a matter of Faith, that the Biſhops of Rome had Right and Power, to judge
of all appeales, from all parts of the world; and it is manifeſtly falſe,
that the Church ever determined, the Doctrine of the Millenaryes; or that S.
Auſtine did deny the Pope had Right to judge of all appeales: though for the
Practiſe therof, there might be juſt cauſe, not to vſe it
promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly, in all occaſions. You ſay, Juſtine Martyr denyes that
ſome good Chriſtians held the contrary to the Millenaryes: But, even
lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants, and more skillfull in the Greeke toung than you are,
interpret S. Juſtine Martyr in a direct contrary ſenſe, as I ſhew
here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And in fine, our Queſtion is only concerning matters defined by
the Church, and not what any particular Doctour might hold. It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes you
hold it not to be a matter of Faith, that Heretikes may giue true Baptiſme:
but S. Auſtine held, and Gods Church believes it, to be ſuch; and by this
example we proue, that ſome Points are matter of Faith, which are not
evidently contained in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To your (N. 13.) I anſwer: <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> (N. 6.) ſaid not, that a perſwaſion that men of different
Religions may be ſaved, is Atheiſme, but a ground of Atheiſme: yea, he
ſayd not this abſolutely, but thus: 
<q rend="margQuotes">there is not a more pernicious
Hereſy, or rather (marke this modification) a ground of Atheiſme, than a
perſwaſion that <pb n="627" facs="tcp:59214:324"/>men of different Religions may be
ſaved.</q> Where you ſee, ſuch a Doctrine is not abſolutely called
Atheiſme, but only that it may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called a ground of Atheiſme, than
a pure, or ordinary, kind of Hereſy. And I pray, is not a perſwaſion,
that men of different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions may be ſaved without repentance, a ground
and diſpoſition, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deny the Deity, which is to be worſhipped
o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly by a true Religion, or not to care much for God, or Religion? And who
would diſlike this ſaying of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> pronounced in
generall, except a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, or ſome ſuch creature? Yourſelfe ſay (N.
8.) That, to deny a thing ſufficiently propoſed, to be revealed by God, is
<hi>to giue God the lye:</hi> and to ſay, that men may be ſaved, who giue
God the lye, is it not a ground, and diſpoſition to end in Atheiſme?
Potter ſaith (Pag: 212.) <hi>Whatſoever is revealed in Scripture, or
propounded by the Church out of Scripture, is in ſome ſenſe fundamentall,
in regard of the Divine Authority of God, and his word, by which it is
recommended: that as, ſuch is may not be denyed, or contradicted without
infidelity.</hi> Why do you not queſtion the Doctor, and aske, how he can be
an infidell, who believes the true God? Remember your owne ſaying, that the
naturall fecundity of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is to beget Errour. And ſo what will follow of
freedom, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fferency for all beliefes (of which one only can be true) but
a flitting from one Errour to another, till they hold no Religion at all? But
the truth is, you could not impugne <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> but by
changing, or rather falſifying the Queſtion, which was, whether men of
different Religions, may be ſaved without repentance, and you ſay, they may
be ſaved, by repentance; wherby it may ſeeme, you do not deny, but it were
a ground of Atheiſme, to aſſirme, that men of different Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may
be ſaved without any repentance, though they liue, and dy in their
errour.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The reſt of your Anſwer, being only an Anſwer, to
ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> propoſed, which haue been
handled at large in other places, I will only briefly note, Firſt; what you
ſay. (Pag: 18. N. 26.) in theſe words (<hi>why an implicite Faith in
Chriſt and his word, ſhould not ſuffice as well as an implicite Faith in
your Church, I haue deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be reſolved by many of your ſide, but
never could</hi>) hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly anſwered (Chap: 2.) where I haue
ſhewed, that Scripture alone neither extenſiue containes all neceſſary
Points of Faith, nor as I may ſay, intenſiue, ſeing euen thoſe Articles
which it containes, for the true and certaine vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of them, require
the authority of the church; <pb n="628" facs="tcp:59214:325"/>to ſay nothing, that we
cannot haue an implicite Faith in the Scripture, vnless it be reſolved into
our beliefe of the Church, for whoſe authority we receaue Scripture it
ſelfe. Secondly; That, (N. 19.) you anſwer not directly to the Queſtion
of <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. P. 15. N. 12.) <hi>(What viſible
Church was there before Luther, diſagreeing with the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Church of
Proteſtants:)</hi> But transferr it, from a Church, to particular men, as if
it were neceſſary, for vs to ſhew, that every man agreed with the Roman
Church, ſeing we know, many particular men, haue fallen into errours; but we
affirme that before Luther, there was no viſible true, Orthodox, Church,
which diſagreed from the Roman, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in thoſe Points, wherin
Proteſtants diſagree from vs. Thirdly, that (Pag: 23. N, 27. as it ſhould
be) you accuſe vs of want of Charity, even while you are in the act of giving
the ſame ill meaſure to vs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that for <hi>want of Charity to
Proteſiants, we alwayes ſuſpect the worſt</hi> of them: and what
greater want of Charity can there be in you, than not only to ſuſpect, but
to pronounce and proclaime in print, that we want Charity, which is the
heavieſt imputation that can be imagined. For, ſeing Charity is major
horum, greater than Faith, or Hope, in ſaying we want Charity, you ſay we
offend againſt a vertue, of greater perfection, than any other, either
Theologicall or Morall. And ſo, Proteſtants in generall, are more
vncharitable, againſt Catholikes, by accuſing them of want of Charity, than
Catholikes can be againſt them, who we ſay, cannot be ſaved, without
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for want of true Faith. And it is well to be obſerved, that
Proteſtants do not accuſe vs, of vncharitableness, in ſaying, they want
true Faith (ſeing they profess to belieue that we alſo erre in Faith,) but
becauſe we ſay, they cannot be ſaved, ſuppoſing they want the true
Faith; as we alſo ought to belieue of ourſelves, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we were moſt
infallibly certaine of the truth of our Faith, as we are. Fourthly. You ſhew
little skill in Divinity, while you make no difference betwixt an erronious
Conſcience, and errour, wheras Conſcience (which is always conſidered in
order to practiſe) may be practicè true and right, and yet rely vpon
ſome invincible ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiue errour: Fiftly. In vaine you labour to proue,
that ignorance is not accidentall to errour; ſeing you know very well, that
<hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Maintayned</hi> ſpoke not of ignorance and errour, as if they
were accidentall to themſelves, or all ignorance accidentall to errour, but
that, to be inexcuſable or not excuſable; vincible or invincible; 
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:59214:325"/>culpable or not culpable; voluntary or not voluntary; are
acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, both to ignorance, and errour, which you will not deny, ſeing
they are ſeparable, and ſome errour may be vincible, and ſome other
invincible &amp;c. Wherin if you impugne him, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute yourſelfe, who
(Pag: 25.) ſay, that he who erres, <hi>though not conceaveable without
ignorance ſimply, may be very well conſidered either as with, or without
voluntary and ſinfull ignorance.</hi> This occurres concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your anſwer
to the Preface. Now I come to anſwer your Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as they lye in

ſinfull errours in the vnderſtanding of a Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and other ſins,
which he might haue committed, hath theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words: <hi>we haue no
revelation, what light might haue cleared his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, <pb n="631" facs="tcp:59214:326"/>or Contrition retracted his ſins, in the laſt moment before his
death.</hi> The reaſon why beſides the relinquiſhing of his errours,
<hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> expreſſly required retractation of all other
deadly ſins, was, leaſt any ſhould thinke, that for the ſalvation of
Proteſtants, or any other Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taryes, it were ſufficient, that they were
cleared from their Hereſyes, and vnited to the Church by Faith; wheras
indeed, after that is done, there remaines a chiefe buſineſſe, which is,
to conceiue effectuall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for all other deadly ſins. For which
cauſe, when we vnderſtand, that a Catholike who hath true Faith, dyes
ſuddenly, or without Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall abſolution, we are moved with juſt
feare, and griefe. So that, <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> expreſſly requires
two things: A renounciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of errours, and contrition, both for thoſe
ſinfull errours, and all other ſins. And therfore you had no reaſon at
all to ſay (Pa. 31. N. 3. <hi>I wiſh you had expreſſed yourſelfe in
this matter more fully and plainly</hi>) hee having declared himſelfe very
clearly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But you are not only vnreaſonable, but vnjuſt
alſo, when you take for plaine, that which even yourſelfe in this very
place ſay was not plaine: And what you ſaie, is only <hi>inſinuated (that
though no light did cleare the errours of a dying Proteſtant,</hi> yet
Contrition might retract his ſins) you take for a plaine affirmation, or
conceſſion, and continue to do ſo, and build vpon it, through your whole
Booke, declaring therby, that you do proficere in pejus, even againſt your
owne ſayings, paſſing from an inſinuating, to a certainty; for which
cauſe, the Author of that pithy, and learned treatiſe, called the totall
ſumme, (Pag: 39.) calles your proceeding in this particular, an <hi>impudent
ſlandering of Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned:</hi> And that, <hi>what you cannot obtaine
by truth and fayre dealing, you ſeeke to get by falſhood, fraud, and
forgery.</hi> And (Pag: 40.) that <hi>without ſhame you falſify the Tenet
of your Adverſary, and the Doctrine of our Church.</hi> And (Pag: 42.) That
the ſaying which (Pag: 31. N. 4.) you <hi>ſet downe. in a diſtinct
character as the verball and formall Aſſertion of Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned is

hardness of your Socinian forhead, and Samoſatenian conſcience.</hi> And
(Pag: 43.) That it is an impudent vntruth; and that your collection of it out
of <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> is a fond and voluntary inference; as moſt
certainly it is. For, neither Charity Maintayned himſelfe, nor any other who
read his Booke, did ever intertaine any leaſt imagination, of ſuch a
meaning. <pb n="632" facs="tcp:59214:327"/>Inſomuch, that a Proteſtant Writer
<hi>Francis Cheynell</hi> hath theſe words; <hi>Men are damned, ſaith he
(Mr. Chillingworth I who dy in willfull errours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance, but what

(Pag: 20.) <hi>That is a contradiction, ſaith the Ieſuit, and he ſayth

that ſinfull errours cannot remaine with repentance, but muſt be

is in our power to deſtroy, by embracing the contrary truths. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> ſaith, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that the ſearch of this truth, will

Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Paſtours; a perpetuall viſibility from the Apoſtles to

<hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> to ſhew how culpable, and inexcuſable they are, who do not

<q rend="margQuotes">Let not men flatter and deceiue

that it is a moſt dangerous <pb n="633" facs="tcp:59214:327"/>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pernicious errour, to
rely vpon the excuſe of invincible ignorance.</q> What could he haue ſayd
more, than to ſtile the Hope of Salvation by meanes of ignorance, a
pernicious errour? Yet more and more to confute your calumnie, and declare his
owne ſenſe, he adds: 
<q rend="margQuotes">I wiſh them to conſider, that he
can leaſt hope for reliefe by ignorance, who once confides therin: becauſe
his very alledging of ignorance, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, that, God hath put ſome thoughts

hope to be ſaved by ignorance, with what truth, or juſtice, can you ſay,
that in his opinion, Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants may be ſaved, without actually retracting
their ſinfull errours? Nay, I am ſure, <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> believes that if
God will in his Goodness bring a man to Salvation, he will be ſure, by his
Wiſdome to apply thoſe Meanes, which in the ordinary courſe of his holy
providence, he hath appointed for that end, which is, to embrace the true
Faith, and to be a true member of the true viſible Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You pretend to beleeue, that de facto God will bring
none to heaven, without Faith in Chriſt, and beliefe of Chriſtian Religion.
If then one ſhould aske, whether a Pagan, or Jew, or Turke could be ſaved
with an vniverſall ſorrow, for all his errours and ſins knowne, and
vnknowne, what would you, anſwer? If you ſay they might be ſaved, you
contradict yourſelfe and grant that Salvation may be had without faith in
Chriſt. If you ſay, they could not be ſaved, becauſe God de facto hath
appointed Faith in Chriſt, as a neceſſary condition, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for
Salvation: The ſame I anſwer in our caſe, that God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to
ſaue none without true Faith, which is only in the true Uiſible Church;
yea, to be a true Chriſtian, and to be a Catholike, is all one, there being
not any other true Chriſtian Faith, than that which is taught by the
Catholique Church, nor is there any true Church of Chriſt, but One: and
therfore, as you pretend to hold, Chriſtian Faith to be neceſſary for
Salvation, you ſhould alſo hold the ſame of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Faith, and
conſequently, that none can be ſaved with any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full errour, contrary
to that Faith, nor that it can be true Repentance, which doth not exclude any
ſuch errour. And, all that you can Object againſt this truth, may be
objected in behalfe of Jewes, or Turks, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your pretended beliefe, that
Faith in Chriſt is neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: <pb n="634" facs="tcp:59214:328"/>They
might, I ſay, demand of you why they may not haue true Contrition, and pardon
of their ſins, by a generall repentance of all their offences, knowne and
vnknowne, and among the reſt, of their errours againſt, or ignorance of
Chriſtian Religion? and what you anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to them, will ſerve for a
confutation of your Arguments againſt vs. For this cauſe, <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> (Part: 1. Pag: 28, N. 3.) ſaith, that we hope, and pray for,
the converſion of Proteſtants: and ſurely, our meaning is not, that they
be converted to vs, by remaining in their former beliefe, contrary to vs. But
<hi>Ch: M.</hi> need not wonder, that you falſify him, ſeing you are not
aſhamed to ſay (Pag: 34. N. 6.) that <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grounds of
our</hi> (Catholike) <hi>Religion, Proteſtants may dy in their ſuppoſed
errours, either with excuſable ignorance, or with contrition, and if they do
ſo, may be ſaved.</hi> But I beſeech you, out of what Ground, or
Principle, of Catholique Religion, can you dreame to collect, that
Proteſtants can be ſaved by ignorance, or with Contrition, remayning
formall Proteſtants? And it is a comfort for <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> to be
calumniated by you, in that very thing, wherin you calumniate the whole Church
of God. In the meane tyme, by what I haue ſayd, innumerable places (I may
ſay the chiefeſt part) of your Booke, are anſwered, which goe vpon this
falſe ground, that men may be ſaved, without relinquiſhing their
ſinfull and damnable errours, which you perpetually affirme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any
proofe. And what reaſon can be given, why a man cannot be ſaved, without
relinquiſhing other deadly ſins, for example, Hatred, Perjury, Theft
&amp;c. and yet that it is not neceſſary, to forſake errours,
confeſſed to be ſinfull, and damnable? But it is no wonder, that
Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes are willing to ſooth their Hereſyes with falſe priviledges,
denyed to all other deadly ſins.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To your numbers 1.2.3.4.5.6. I haue anſwered already.
You ſay (Pag: 33. N. 4.) (<hi>the truth is, the corruption of the Church, and
the deſtruction of it, is not all one? For if a particular man, or Church,
may (as you confeſſe they may) hold ſome particular errours, and yet be a
mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church vniverſall: why may not the Church hold ſome
vniverſall errour and yet be ſtill the Church? Eſpecially ſeing you
ſay, it is nothing but oppoſing the Doctrine of the Church, that makes an
errour damnable, and it is imposſible that the Church should oppoſe the
Church, I meane that the preſent Church should oppoſe itſelfe.</hi> Why
do you ſtopp here, and not goe forward to declare, what lyes involued in your
diſcourſe, thus: In the tyme of the Apoſtles, <hi>if a particular man, or
Church</hi> might haue <pb n="635" facs="tcp:59214:328"/>held ſome errour, and yet
remained a member of the Church vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall: Why might not the Church of that
tyme haue held ſome vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall errour, and yet haue beene ſtill the
Church? You muſt anſwer your owne Argument; which is eaſy for vs
Catholikes to doe, by ſaying:</p>
               <p n="5">5. Firſt. No particular man, or Church, may hold any
ſinfull, and damnable errour, and yet be a member of the Church vniverſall.
Which is a truth to be believed by all Proteſtants, if they vnderſtand
themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves: and, as I haue often ſayd, Potter confeſſeth that <hi>it
is, Fundamentall to the Faith of a Chriſtian, not to disbelieue any point,
ſufficiently knowne to be revealed by God, and that he who does ſo, is an
heretike, and that hereſy being a worke of the fleſh, excludes from the
kingdome of Heaven.</hi> And what a Church would you haue that to be, which
conſiſts of Heretikes?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Secondly: To put a parity between particular men or
Churches, and the Church vniverſall, may very well beſeeme ſome Socinian,
who makes ſmall eſteeme of the Authority of the Church, but reſolves
faith into every mans private judgment and reaſon; and therfore no wonder, if
ſuch a Church be ſubject to corruptions, no leſſe than private men,
whoſe naturall witts, and reaſon muſt integrate, as I may ſay, the
whole Authority, of, and certainty, in ſuch a Church, and therfore if
particular perſons may fall into errours, the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be free from
them: yea ſhe muſt containe in her boſome, or rather bowells, ſuch
corruptions and errours, and ſo many poyſons, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory one to
another, and yet not breake. A noble latitude of hart, and a vaſt kind of
helliſhlike Charity! But for vs, your Argument hath no force at all. For, we
belieue the Church, to be the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, wherby Divine Revelations are conveyed
to our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and to be the Judge of Controverſyes, as hath beene
proved her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore at large; and this being ſuppoſed, we muſt make vſe
of your ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne words (Pag: 35. N. 7.) That the <hi>meanes to decide
Controverſyes in faith and Religion, muſt be endued with an vniverſall
Infallibility in whatſoever it propoundeth for a Divine Truth.</hi> From
whence it followes, that every errour in Faith is deſtructiue of that
infallibility, which is required in the meanes to decide Controverſyes in
Faith and Religion. Which is further confirmed by thoſe words of yours (Pag:
9. N. 6.) <hi>No conſequence can be more palpable then this; The Church of
Rome doth erre in this or that, therfore it is not infallible.</hi> Therfore,
ſay I, to affirme that the Church can erre, is to ſay; ſhe is not
infallible, nor can be judge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes, <pb n="636" facs="tcp:59214:329"/>nor the
meanes to convey Divine Revelations to our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; nor could ſhe be
a Guide, even in matters Fundamentall, as we haue proved els where, and
yourſelfe grant this laſt ſequele to be good. And in a word, ſhe would
ceaſe to be that Church, which we are ſure ſhe is.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thus you ſay, that Scripture, which alone you hold to
be the Rule of Faith, and decider of Controverſyes, muſt be vniverſally
infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and that any the leaſt errour, were enough to blaſt the whole
Authority therof: As alſo, if the Apoſtles, who were appointed to teach
Divine Truths, could by word or writting haue taught any falſhood, we could
not haue relyed on their Authority, in any point of faith, great, or
little.</p>
               <p n="8">8. You ſay (Pag: 143. N. 30.) <hi>There is not the
ſame reaſon for the Churches abſolute infalliblity, as for the Apoſtles
and Scriptures. For, if the Church fall into errour, it may be reformed by
comparing it with the Rule of the Apoſtles Doctrine and Scripture. But if the
Apoſtles haue erred in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, to whom
ſhall we haue recourſe for the diſcovering and correcting their
errour?</hi> Theſe your words, prompt vs a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Anſwer, and diſparity,
between the Church, and private perſons: who, if they fall into errour, the
errour may be reformed by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with the Decrees, Traditions, and
Definitions of Gods Church. But if the Church erre, <hi>to whom ſhall we haue
recourſe, for the diſcovering and correcting her errour?</hi> Nay, I do
take a forcible Argument, by inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and retorting, your owne words. For,
ſuppoſing your Doctrine, that we belieue Scripture to be true, and the word
of God, for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church; and another ſaying of yours, that a
proofe muſt be more knowne to vs, than the thing proved, otherwiſe, ſay
you, it is no proofe; I argue thus: There is not the ſame reaſon for our
beliefe of the abſolute infallibility of the Apoſtles and Scripture, as for
the Church. For, if falſe Scripture be obtruded, it may be diſcovered, by
comparing it with the Tradition, and conſent of the Church, from which we
receiue the Scripture, as the word of God, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the
certainty we haue of the contents therof. But if the Church may erre, to whom
ſhall we haue recourſe, for diſcovering and correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her errours
ſeing, as I ſayd, to compare it with the Rule of the Apoſtles doctrine,
will be to no purpoſe, becauſe that very Rule, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be of no force with vs,
but for the Authority of the Church, which therfore muſt be as great, or
greater with vs, then Scripture it ſelfe, according <pb n="637" facs="tcp:59214:329"/>to
your owne ſaying, <hi>The proofe muſt be more knowne, than the thing
proved</hi> Our B. Saviour ſayd (Matt: 5.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Uos eſt is ſal terrae: you are the
ſalt of the earth: But if the ſalt leeſe his vertue, wherwith ſhall it
be ſalted? Vpon which words, S. Auſtine (L. 1. de ſerm: Domini in monte
C. 6.) ſaith Si vos &amp;c. If you by whom others are to be as it were
ſeaſoned, forfeite the kingdome of heaven, vpon feare of temporall
perſecution, what other perſons ſhall be found, to free you from errour,
ſeing God hath choſen you to take away errours from others?</q> So we may
ſay: If the Church, which God hath appointed to teach others, and deliver
them the Scripture, ſhould erre, who could be found, to diſcover, and
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect that errour? Your Argument is no better than this: If a man may be a
man, though he be deprived of ſome vnneceſſary part of his Body, as
fingers, feete &amp;c. why may he not remaine a man, though he want ſome
parts abſolutly neceſſary, for the conſervation of him in Being, as
hart, head, braine &amp;c.? For, infallibility in the Church, is a priviledge,
neceſſary, and, as I may ſay, eſſentiall to her, as ſhe is the
judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſyes in Faith, which office belonging to no private
perſons, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility is not neceſſary for them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To your vaine ſubtility, That we ſay, <hi>It is
nothing but oppoſing the Doctrine of the Church, that makes an errour
damnable, and it is imposſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Church ſhould oppoſe the Church,
I meane, that the preſent Church ſhould oppoſe it ſelfe;</hi> From
whence you would collect; that if the Church ſhould erre, yet her errour
being not damnable, (as not oppoſite to the Church herſelfe) ſhe might
ſtill remaine a Church; I anſwer; By the ſame reaſon, you may ſay the
Apoſtles might erre, and yet remaine of the Church, and their errour not be
damnable (yea even though it were damnable and fundamentall, which is to be
noted:) becauſe, <hi>It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but oppoſing the Doctrine of the
Apoſtles, that makes an errour dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and it is imposſible the
Apoſtles ſhould oppoſe</hi> the Apoſtles. The like you may ſay of
Scripture it ſelfe, that it might erre, and yet that it could not containe
any damnable errour, becauſe according to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, <hi>It is nothing
but oppoſing</hi> the Scripture, <hi>that makes an errour damnable, and it is
imposſible that the</hi> Scripture <hi>ſhould oppoſe</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
which conſequences are abſurd, and therfore, as you would anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, by
denying the ſuppoſition, that the Apoſtles, can teach, or Scripture can
containe any errour, ſo you know, we abſolutly deny your ſuppoſition,
that the Church can erre in matters of Faith; which if we did grant, we would
not be ſo fooliſh, as to beliefe, that, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but oppoſing the
Doctrine of the Church, makes an errour dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; <pb n="638" facs="tcp:59214:330"/>but
contrarily, we would affirme, that, preciſily to oppoſe the Churches
Doctrine, (that ſuppoſition being once made) could never be Hereſy, or a
damnable errour. And therfore we ſpeake very conſequently, in, Firſt,
believing, that the Church cannot erre; and, then, in avouching, that every
errour repugnant to the Doctrine of the Church, is hereſy. The Motto in the
frontiſpice of your Booke, taken out of Jſaac: Caſaubon: (in Epiſt: ad
Card:

Obſerue, that he ſpeakes of things abſolutely neceſſary to
ſalvation, and then I ſay, if the Church be ſubject to errour, how can we
be ſure, that Her Deductions from Scripture, are neceſſary, or only
probable; true, or falſe; though to her they may ſeeme, true, and
neceſſary? You ſay, <hi>it is imposſible that the preſent Church
ſhould oppoſe itſelfe,</hi> and do not reflect, by this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſaying,
yourſelfe muſt ſuppoſe that the Church can teach nothing but truth.
For, if ſhe may erre in ſome Points, and believe aright in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, thoſe
errours may be oppoſite to ſome truth which ſhe believes, though ſhe do
not marke that oppoſition. You ſay (Pag: 215. N. 46.) <hi>no mans errours

that contradicts her errour; and therefore if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that the
Church can be oppoſite to herſelfe (as you ſay it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible) you
muſt grant, that ſhe cannot belieue or teach any errour; and then indeed it
will be impoſſible for her to oppoſe herſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe truth cannot
poſſibly be oppoſite to truth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In the ſame (N. 4.) I muſt touch in a word; that

ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, not all Controverſyes, but all neceſsary to be
determined.</hi> Which conceſſion is as much as we deſire. For, no man
dare ſay, that God hath given any meanes, only for ſuperfluous vſes, or
occaſions: and therfore ſeing he hath left meanes for deciding all
Controverſyes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be determined, we cannot without injury to
his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, imagine that there will never be neceſſity of
determining any. Since then, as I ſayd, God hath given Authority to his
viſible Church for determining ſuch Controverſyes, he will not faile to
repleniſh her with Wiſdome to diſcerne, what be the occaſions, wherin
they ought to be determined, according to the exigence of particular
circumſtances. Thus the Apoſtles called a Councell, vpon occaſion of
difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians about the Law of Moyſes, and the firſt
foure Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councells, which commonly Proteſtants pretend to receiue,
were gathered vpon ſeverall occaſions, of emergent Hereſyes. The
Scripture it ſelfe was not written all at once, but as occaſion did
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: and the ſame Holy Spirit, which aſſiſted Canonicall Writers
in writing, did appoint to them the tymes, and occaſions, for which their
writings would be moſt ſeaſonable; yet after they were once written, it
was neceſſary to belieue them, as alſo the Decree of the Apoſtles in
their Councell regiſtred (Act: 15.) and other Generall Councells, and
commands of the Church. If Controverſyes riſe to ſuch a height, that
there is periculum in mora, danger in delaying to determine them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for
avoiding inſufferable breach of Charity, and Schiſme, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in
manners, or invalidity of Sacraments, which cannot be otherwiſe prevented; If
ſilence may be interpreted to imply a conſent; If errour be like to
prevaile, vnleſſe it be condemned; if new Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes be in danger to take
roote, if they be not cruſhed with ſpeede; if <pb n="640" facs="tcp:59214:331"/>theſe, or any other cauſes require the Deciſion of
Controverſyes, the Holy Ghoſt will effectually inſpire, and direct his
Church, to apply a convenient remedy, according to the Condition of the matter.
Neither ought it to ſeeme ſtrang, that ſomthing may grow to be
neceſſary, one tyme, which was not neceſſary at another; and in the
meane tyme men may be ſaved, by an humble preparation of mynd to belieue, and
obey, whatſoever the Church ſhall, in good tyme, determine, or command. And
by the way, out of this diſcourſe, we may inferr, that, Scripture alone
cannot be a Rule to decide all Controverſyes; in regard that ſuch a Rule,
or judge muſt ſerue for all emergent occaſions, and Scripture being
always the ſame, cannot be applyed ſutably to all new different
circumſtances, as I haue often ſaied.</p>
               <p n="12">12. You ſay; <hi>If ſome Controverſyes may for many
Ages be vndeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and yet in the meane tyme men may be ſaved, why
ſhould, or how can, the Churches being furniſhed with effectuall meanes to
determine all Controverſyes in Religion be neceſſary to ſalvation, the
end itſelfe to which theſe meanes are ordained, being as experience
ſhewes, not neceſſary?</hi> But, the Anſwer to this objection, hath
been given already. For, ſome thing may be neceſſary for ſome
perſons, at ſome tyme, in ſome Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are not
neceſſary vniverſally for all Perſons, Tymes, and Circumſtances; as I
ſpecifyed in the Councell of the Apoſtles; in Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall writings (which
written vpon ſome particular occaſion, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an vniverſall
beliefe) and in generall Councells, which you and Potter affirme to oblige, as
we haue ſeene aboue. Indeed your perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory wild demand <hi>(Why should, or
how can the Churches being furnished with effectuall Meanes to determine all
Controverſyes, be neceſſary &amp;c:)</hi> might well, by your leaue,
beſeeme ſome Jew, asking; why ſhould, or how can Chriſtian Religion be
neceſſary to ſalvation, if for many Ages it was not in Being, and yet in
the meane tyme, men were ſaved? Or, why ſhould, or how can the believing
and obeying the Definition of the Apoſtles in their Councell, or the beliefe
of the Goſpells, and other Canonicall writings, be neceſſary to
ſalvation, if for many ages ſuch beliefe was not required, and in the meane
tyme men were ſaued? Or, why ſhould, or how can infallibility be
neceſſary to write the Scripture, if the writing of Scripture was not
neceſſary, but that men were ſayed without it? You ſay in the ſame
(N. 7.) <hi>I grant, that the meanes to decide Controverſyes of Faith and
Religion, muſt be indued with an vniverſall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in whatſoever
it propoundeth for a Divine Truth. For, if it may <pb n="641" facs="tcp:59214:331"/>be
falſe in any one thing of this nature, we can yield vnto it but a wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and fearfull aſsent in any thing.</hi> Which words ſeeme not to agree with
what you add againſt <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in his (N. 7. &amp; 8.)
(that an vniverſall infallibility muſt be granted to that meanes, wherby
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſyes in Faith are to be determined, vnless men haue a mynd to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Faith to opinion) of which words you ſay, you do not <hi>perceyue,
how from the denyall of any of the grounds</hi> which <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> layd, <hi>it would follow, that Faith is Opinion: or from the
granting them, that it is not ſo.</hi> For my part, I do not perceyue, how it
was poſſible for you not to perceyue it; ſince you confess, that without
an vniverſall infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we could yield vnto ſuch a meanes, but;
wavering and fearfull aſſent a and what is this but opinion, or a meere
humane Faith? As contrarily if the Meanes, or Motiue, for which I aſſent be
infallible, and I belieue it to be ſo, and aſſent with an act
proportionable to that motiue, my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent muſt needs be certaine, and
infallible, and not a wavering, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aſſent. If this be not ſo,
why do you require infallibility in the ſaid meanes? Certainly, infallibility
is not neceſſary, to beget, a wavering and fearfull aſſent.</p>
               <p n="13">13. You would gladly free yourſelfe of that juſt
imputation, that you confound Divine Faith with opinion. But your
tergiverſation argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es you guilty. You bring I know not what parityes, betwen
Faith and Opinion, but decline the maine difference, That Divine Faith, is
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely certaine and infallible; Opinion not. You being conſcious of
your Antichriſtian Doctrine, That Chriſtian Faith exceeds not probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
diſſemble the chiefe difference, which I haue declared; and you will never
be able to acquit yourſelfe of that grie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vous, but juſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that
you change Divine Faith into opinion. Wheras you ſay, <hi>that, as opinion,
ſo Faith, admitts degrees; and, that as there maybe a ſtrong and weake
opinion ſo there may be a ſtrong and weake Faith,</hi> and add, that
<hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> if he <hi>be</hi> in his <hi>right mynd, will not deny
it.</hi> I anſwer that ſtill you ſticke to your falſe ground, that
Chriſtian Faith is not infallible. Otherwiſe you would not make this
compariſon, between the weakness, and ſtrength, of Opinion, and Faith,
which, in its eſſence excludes all falſhood; As contrarily, Opinion is
not free from all feare leaſt it be falſe.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The confutation of your (N. 8.) about the
infallibility of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Faith, is the ſubject of my firſt Chapter,
and therfore I need ſay no more here, except only to aske, what you can
vnderſtand by theſe words of yours? <hi>But though the eſſence of Faith
exclude not all weakness <pb n="642" facs="tcp:59214:332"/>and imperfection, yet may it be
enquired, whether any certainty of Faith, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the higheſt degree, may be
ſufficient to pleaſe God and attaine ſalvation.</hi> Can the very
eſſence of Faith be weake and imperfect, and yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees therof, be
certaine in the higheſt degree, and exclude that weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and imperfection,
which the eſſence doth not exclude? is not the whole eſſence of Faith,
in every degree, or graduall perfection therof? But, as I ſayd, (directly
contrary to that which your words ſeeme to ſound) the very eſſence of
Faith, excludes all weakneſſe, that is, all falſhood, and
doubtfulneſſe, and every graduall entity therof includes ſuch a
certainty, though one mans Faith, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the ſame
eſſence, may exceed the Faith of another, in gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perfections, as
contrarily, though Opinion may haue many graduall entityes, yet none of them
can exclude formidinem oppoſiti, a feare that the contrary may proue true,
which if any particular degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion did exclude, it were not
Opinion, but a certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſo could not be a degree of
intenſion, vnder the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or eſſence, of Opinion, but an
aſſent, eſſentially diſtinct from all Opinion.</p>
               <p n="15">15. In your (N. 9.) I obſerue that you do not only
grant the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a certainty of adherence in the will, beyond the
certainty of evidence in the vnderſtanding, but alſo a certainty of
knowledge in the vnderſtanding, aboue the ſtrength of probable Motives, or
Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Credibility. For, you ſay, they know (marke this word know)
<hi>what they did but belieue; and are as fully and reſolutely aſſured of
the Goſpell of Chriſt, as thoſe which heard it from Chriſt himſelfe
with their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, which ſaw it with their eyes, which looked vpon it, and
whoſe hands handled the word of life.</hi> If God can do this with his Grace;
ſeing Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Faith requires the Grace of God; why do you deny, that by
it we are no less aſſured, that the Objects of Faith are true, than if we
had ſeene them with our eyes &amp;c:? The reſt of this number is
anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Chap: 1.</p>
               <p n="16">16. You are pleaſed N. 10. to delight yourſelfe, and
deceiue others, with a wild collection, as you ſtile it, fathered on <hi>Ch:
Ma:</hi> being only a brood of your owne braine. The caſe ſtands thus.
<hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> (N. 8.) hath theſe words: Out of the Principles which I haue
layd (That there muſt be in Gods Church, ſome meanes for deciding
Controverſyes in Faith, and that it muſt be indued with an vniverſall
infallibility, in whatſoever it propounds, as ſpoken by God) it vndeniably
followes, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that of two men <pb n="643" facs="tcp:59214:332"/>diſſenting in matters of Faith, the one cannot be ſaved without
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, vnless ignorance accidentally may in ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
plead excuſe. For, in that caſe of contrary beliefe, one muſt of
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be held to oppoſe Gods Word or revelation, ſufficiently
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to his vnderſtanding, by an infallible Propounder; which
oppoſition to the Teſtimony of God, is vndoubtedly a damnable ſin,
whether otherwiſe the thing ſo teſtifyed, be, in it ſelfe, great, or
ſmall.</q> Now what can be more evident than this conſequence, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion? And yet you ſay, <hi>The concluſion is true, though the
conſequence of it from the former Premiſſes, either is none at all, or
ſo obſcure, that I can hardly diſcerne it:</hi> and then you add: the
difference may be <hi>concerning a thing which being indeed no matter of Faith,
is yet overvalued by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes at variance, and eſteemed to be ſo:</hi>
And laſtly you ſet downe the wild collection I ſpoke of, and deliver it
in theſe words: <hi>God hath provided meanes ſufficient to decide all
controverſyes in Religion, neceſſary to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; this meanes is
vniverſally infallible; Therfore of two, that differ in any thing which they
eſteeme a matter of Faith, one cannot be ſaved. He that can find any
connexion between theſe Propoſitions, I belieue will be able to find good
coherence betweene the deafe plaintiffes accuſation, in the Greeke
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigramme, and the deafe Defendants Anſwer, and the deafe judges ſentence:
and to contriue them all into a formall categoricall ſylogiſme.</hi> Thus
you. But <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> never pretended to make a ſyllogiſme,
and his words, which I haue even now alledged, cleare him from your vaine
imputation, and fond collection. He ſayd expreſſly, <hi>(vnless
ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance plead excuſe)</hi> which makes the errours againſt Divine
Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be ſinfull and damnable; ſeing he ſpeakes of perſons,
not excuſed by ignorance. Neither hath he thoſe words which you add
(neceſſary to be decided) nor thoſe other (which they eſteeme a matter
of Faith) yea he ſpoke formally and expreſſly, of two men diſſenting
in matters of Faith, and not in Points, which they only eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be
matters of Faith. And becauſe you thinke it impoſſible, to contriue his
diſcourſe into a formall categoricall ſyllogiſme (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would
be impoſſible to doe with your Additions;) let vs ſuppoſe, ſome Truth
to be revealed by God, and ſufficiently propounded to the vnderſtandings of
two, by a Propounder infallible in himſelfe, and by them certainly believed
to be ſuch (which is the direct ſuppoſition of <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi>) and that one of them contradicts the other, and conſequently
by ſo doing, oppoſes a Truth teſtifyed by God, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently 
<pb n="944" facs="tcp:59214:333"/>propounded as ſuch: And then what ſay you to this
ſyllogiſme? Whoſoever oppoſes a Truth, witneſſed by God, and for
ſuch ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented to his vnderſtanding, by a propounder,
believed by the party himſelfe to be infallible, committs a grievous ſin
(and ſo cannot be ſaved without repentance) but in the caſe propoſed,
one of the two contradicting partyes, oppoſeth a Truth, revealed by God, and
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propounded to his vnderſtanding, by ſuch an infallible
propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Therfore he committs a grievous ſin. Yourſelfe here (N. 13.)
grant, that they cannot be ſaved who oppoſe any leaſt part of Scripture,
<hi>If they oppoſe it after ſufficient declaration, ſo that either they
know it to be contained in Scripture, or haue no juſt probable Reaſon, and
which may moue an honeſt man to doubt, whether or no it be there
contayned;</hi> as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in our caſe, wherin we ſuppoſe, that the
erring party is in ſinfull errour, by reaſon of oppoſing, an infallible
Propounder, of Divine Truths, whoſoever that Propounder be. This very thing
you grant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the (N. 11.) where you ſay: <hi>Indeed if the matter in
agitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were plainly decided by this infallible meanes of deciding
Controverſyes, and the partyes in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance knew it to be ſo, and yet would
ſtand out in their diſsenſion; this were in one of them, direct
opoſition to the teſtimony of God, and vndoubtedly a damnable ſin.</hi>
Which is the very thing that <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> clearly affirmed. And now, you
haue loſt your jeaſt, out of the Greeke Epigramme, turned by you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a
Satyre. Thrice happy had it beene for you, to haue been deafe, dumbe, and
blind, rather than to haue ever heard, or ſpoken any thing, or that others
ſhould haue ſeene thoſe vaſt abſurdityes, and wicked He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſyes of
yours, which openly deſtroy Chriſtian Religion! But there is a juſt
judge, who is neither deafe, nor dumbe, nor blind, but heares, and ſees, and
puniſheth all pride, contempt, and Hereſy, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probators of them, if
they do not repent, and in tyme declare to the world ſuch their
Repentance.</p>
               <p n="17">17. You ſpeake (N. 11.) to <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> in this
manner: <hi>You may hope that the erring Part, by reaſon of ſome veile
before his eyes, ſome excuſable ignorance, or vnavoydable prejudice, does
not ſee the Queſtion to be decided againſt him, and ſo oppoſes only
what you knowe to be the word of God, and he might know, were he voide of
prejudice. Which is a fault, I confeſſe, but a fault which is incident even
to good and honeſt men very often.</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which words I aske; how
can that be a ſin, which proceeds from ſome excuſable Ignorance, or
vnavoidable prejudice? For, if the cauſe of the errour be vnavoydable, and
conſequently invincible, and, as you <pb n="645" facs="tcp:59214:333"/>expreſſly
ſay, excuſable, how can the errour itſelfe be ſinfull? Or, if it be a
fault, as you ſay it is, how is it not a grievous fault, conſiſting in a
culpable oppoſition againſt Divine Revelation, which you perpetually
profess to be damnable? Or, how can a grievous and damnable fault be incident
to good and honeſt men?</p>
               <p n="18">18 To your ſaying (N. 12.) That it is againſt Charity
to affirme, that <hi>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are juſtly chargeable with all the conſequences of
their opinions;</hi> I anſwer, as yourſelfe, and every one muſt anſwer
to the like objection in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other occaſions; that <hi>men are
juſtly chargeable with all the conſequences of their opinions;</hi> if
their not ſeing thoſe conſequences, proceede from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me voluntary,
vincible, roote, as ignorance and errours againſt divine Faith are ſinfull,
and damnable, when they are Effects of ſinfull cauſes.</p>
               <p n="19">19. In the (N. 13.) I will only touch in a word, that in
ſaying <hi>(S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian and Stephen might both be ſaved, becauſe their
contrary beliefe was not touching any point contayned in Scripture.)</hi> You
either grant, that it is not a Point of Faith, That, Baptiſme conferred by
Heretikes is valid, (Wherin, for ought I know, you contradict the chiefeſt
number of Proteſtants, and in particular your Engliſh Church) or els that
ſomthing may be a Point of Faith, which is not contained in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="20">20. In your (N. 14.15.16.17.) there is no difficulty.
Only it is cleare that you voluntarily alter the ſtate of the Queſtion,
wherin <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> alwayes ſuppoſed, that ſpeech was of Points,
contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that a man oppoſed the Scripture, culpably: For
which cauſe, (N. 17.) he ſayd: 
<q rend="margQuotes">According to Proteſtants, Oppoſe
not ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there is no errour againſt Faith. Oppoſe it in any
leaſt Point, the errour (if Scripture be ſufficiently propoſed, which
propoſition is alſo required, before a man can be obliged to belieue even
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points) muſt be damnable:</q> Which words you ſhamefully
conceale, out of guiltyness, that they prevented all your Anſwers (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Ignorance, or ſuch accidentall and variable circumſtances, to which you
ſly) before you gaue them: Seing it appeares that <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi>
ſpoke expreſſly of Scripture ſufficiently propoſed; and (N. 15.) you
ſay, That ſuch Points are fundamentall. Our B. Saviour ſaith (S. Marke
16.16.) he that does not belieue ſhall be damned. And S. Paul, (Gal:
5.20.21.) having reckoned ſome vices, and among the reſt, Sects, concludes;
<hi>They who doe theſe things, shall not obtaine the <pb n="646" facs="tcp:59214:334"/>kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Will you now ſtand vp, and blaſpheme,
and ſay, that our Saviour and S. Paul ſhould not haue pronounced damnation,
againſt disbelievers, Sects, and Heretykes, without adding your limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
to wit vnless ignorance excuſe, or a generall Repentance ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pardon?</p>
               <p n="21">21. In your (N. 15.) you giue a new explication of Points
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, and not Fundamentall, <hi>That theſe Points either in
themſelves or by accident, are Fundamentall, which are evidently contained in
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to him that knoweth them to be ſo.</hi> Thoſe not
<hi>Fundamentall, which are there-hence deducible, but probably only not
evidently.</hi> How many things may be obſerved in theſe words: Firſt, it
anſwers not plainly to the Queſtion of <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> which was; whether
is there in ſuch denyall (of a Point contained in Scripture, and
ſufficiently propoſed, as <hi>Ch. M.</hi> expreſſly ſpeakes) <hi>any
diſtinction betwixt Points Fundamentall and not Fundamentall, ſufficient to
excuſe from Hereſy?</hi> As certainly there is not. Secondly, by this
diſtinction of yours, all that is ſufficiently propoſed to be contained
in Scripture, is a Fundamentall Point, and every er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in ſuch Points
muſt be a Fundamentall errour, and deſtroy Faith, Church, and ſalvation:
and ſo you grant, what <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> deſired in his Queſtion, though
you thought not fitt to Anſwer it clearly and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect termes, but to
involue things, by talking of matters nothing to the purpoſe; and therfore I
ſay, Thirdly; Points deducible from Scripture but probably only, are not
Points of Faith, which requires certitude, but may be denyed without ſin, if
one haue probable reaſon, for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall, as yourſelfe confess (N. 14.)
that it is a grievous ſin to deny any one Truth contayned in Scripture, if he
who denyes it, <hi>knew it to be ſo, or haue no probable reaſon to doubt of
it: Otherwiſe not. Ch: Ma:</hi> as I ſayd, ſpoke expreſſly, of Points
ſufficiently knowne to be contayned in Scripture, that is, of matters of
Faith; and by what logicke can you diſtinguiſh Points of Faith, into Points
which are of Faith, and points which are not of Faith, as things which are
deduced from Scripture probably only, are not matters of Faith; as we haue
ſeene out of your owne words. Doth not Logick teach, that the Diuiſum,
muſt be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of everie one membrorum dividentium, and will you affirme
faith of that which is not Faith?</p>
               <p n="23">23. In your (N. 16.) To the Queſtion of <hi>Ch:
Ma;</hi> whether it be <hi>not impertinent to alledge the Creed, as containing
all Fundamentall Points of Faith, as if believing it alone, we were at liberty
to deny all other Points <pb n="647" facs="tcp:59214:334"/>of Scripture;</hi> you anſwer,
It was never alledged to any ſuch purpoſe. But, as in other Points, ſo in
this, you ſpeake for Proteſtants, without any commiſſion, or warrant
from them. For, who knowes not, that nothing is more common with them, than to
ſay, that Proteſtants may be ſaved, and are brethren, as agreeing in the
ſubſtance of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all of them belieue the Creed; which
reaſon were plaine non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe if they may belieue the Creed, and yet not
be of one Faith, nor hope of Salvation, by reaſon of their diſagreement in
other Points? Or what availes it them, to agree in neceſſariò
credendis, all which you ſay the Creed containes, (which yet is very falſe)
if they differ in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendis, in Articles of Faith, by which they are directed
for Chriſtian Practiſe; Seing Proteſtants differ not only in credendis,
but in agendis? Howſoever, I take what you giue, that the Creed cannot be
pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged, as if believing it alone, Proteſtants may diſagree
in other Points, and yet remaine Brethren; and ſo by this very anſwer, you
grant, what <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> intended to proue, that diſagreement
in any one Point of Faith, be it great, or little, cannot ſtand with
Salvation, on his ſide, whoſe errour is culpable: As wholoſome meate,
taken alone, may nouriſh, but if the ſame man receiue poyſon, he ſhall
not eſcape death, in vertue of that meate, which otherwiſe might haue
conſerved him in life, and health. Bonum ex integra cauſa, malum ex
quocunque defectu. One damnable errour, is enough to worke perdition, though a
man belieue all Truths, except that which is contrary to ſuch an errour.</p>
               <p n="22">22. I haue no more to ſay about this firſt Chapter,
except only that you might haue comprized, the ſubſtance therof, in few

much vnneceſſary labour which otherwiſe muſt haue beene ſpent, in
ſpeaking to every particular Section of yours. For, in this Chapter, I find
litle, but either paſſion, or calumny, or begging of the Queſtion, or
what is anſwered already, till I come to your (N. 30.) which alſo containes
nothing but a matter of fact, whether Brierly, and <hi>Ch. Ma:,</hi> and other
Catholique Writers, haue abuſed Hooker in ſaying, that he teaches, that
Scripture cannot be proved to be the word of God, by the teſtimony of
ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture itſelfe, but by ſome other meanes, namely the Church. For my
part, I haue read, and conſidered the place, cited by <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> out of
Hooker (Lib: 3. Sect: 8.) and find, that you are like thoſe charitable
people, who are content to want one eye, vpon condition, that their adverſary
be deprived of both. You are willing, that Hooker contradict Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
yourſelfe; and evident reaſon itſelfe, rather than he ſhould ſeeme to
favour vs. I ſay, he muſt contradict reaſon, which can never proue, that
Scripture is written by Divine inſpiration, as I know you will not deny,
ſeing all the contents of Scripture, might haue bene ſet 
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:59214:335"/>downe in writing, without the infallible direction of the
Holy Ghoſt. You ſay (Pag: 114. N. 156.) <hi>If there were any that believed
Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and yet believed not the Bible to be the word of God,
though they believed the matter of it to be true (which is no imposſible
ſuppoſition, for I may belieue a Booke of S. Auſtines, to containe
nothing but the truth of God, and yet not to haue beene inſpired by God
himſelfe) againſt ſuch men there were no diſputing out of the
Bible.</hi> In which words you confess, that one cannot gather that a writing
is inſpired by God, even though he did belieue, that the contents therof were
all true. You make him alſo contradict yourſelfe, who reſolue the beliefe
of Scripture into the tradition of all Churches: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>C: Ma:</hi>
ſpecifies not the preſent Church, but ſaith o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, that Hooker
acknowledged that we belieue Scripture for the Authority of the Church. He
muſt alſo contradict himſelfe, who I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe liking not the Puritans
privat ſpirit, and proving that it is not the word of God which doth, or
poſſibly can aſſure vs, (as may be ſeene in <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> (Pag: 42. N. 7.) citing the place of Hooker, leaves nothing for
our motiue to belieue it, except the Church. Yet no man denyes, but what we
firſt belieue for the Authority of the Church, may afterward be illuſtrated
and confirmed by Reaſon: as Hooker ſaith, 
<q rend="margQuotes">The former inducement (the Authority of
Gods Church) prevailing ſomwhat with vs before, doth now much more prevaile,
when the very thing hath miniſtred farther reaſon.</q> And yourſelfe in
this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (N. 47.) explicate ſome words of Potter in this very ſenſe
which now I haue declared: And therfore conſider, whether you do well in
relating Mookers words, to leaue out theſe words (which are immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyned to thoſe which you cite) 
<q rend="margQuotes">If I belieue the Goſpell, yet is
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſingular vſe, for that it confirmeth me in this my beliefe the
more.</q> Is this to ſay, that naturall reaſon (as it is diſtinguiſhed
from tradition or Authority of the Church, in which ſenſe we now ſpeake
of it) is the laſt thing into which our beliefe of Scripture is reſolved,
ſeing ſuch a confirmation by Reaſon, comes after we haue believed? You
ſay, that when Hooker ſaith, <hi>When we know the whole Church of God hath

particular Church wherin a man is bredd:</hi> where I put you in mynd, of what
you ſayd in another place, that, A, Church ſignifyes a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church,
and, The, Church, (as Hooker ſpeakes) ſignifyes the vniverſall. How then
do you ſay, That by, The, Church he ſignifies a particular Church? Or how
is the Diſtinction of, A, and, The, Church <pb n="650" facs="tcp:59214:336"/>ſuch as
you would haue men belieue. But this I let paſſe, and aske you, what
finally you will haue Hookers opinion to be concerning the meanes for which we
belieue with certainty Scripture to be the word of God? The private Spirit? You
know he was an Anti-Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, and the private ſpirit could not ſute
with his genius. Naturall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? That is evidently againſt reaſon, as
we haue ſhewed, and you grant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when he ſpeakes moſt of reaſon,
he ſpeakes of infidells, or Atheiſts, calling in queſtion the authority
of Scripture, who may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by Sanctity of Chriſtian doctrine
&amp;c: So there remaines only the Authority of the Church, if you will haue
him to ſay anything. Dr: Covell in his defence of Hookers Bookes (Art: 4.
Pag: 31.) ſaith clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Doubtless it is a tolerable Ovinion in the
Church of Rome, if they goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ſome of them do not</hi> (he
ſhould haue ſayd, as none of them doe) <hi>to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the
ſcriptures are holy and divine in themſelves, but ſo eſteemed by vs,
for the Authority of the Church.</hi> Theſe words of Covell were cited by
<hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> (N. 26.) but it ſeemes you would take no notice of them,
and who could better vnderſtand Hookers mynd, than this his Defendant? By the
way, we may obſerue, how hard it is to agree about the ſenſe of holy
Scripture, which is more ſublime than humane Writings, if we cannot agree
about the meaning of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And by this occaſion, I muſt turne backe to your
(N. 11.) where you quarrel at ſome words of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> and
giue them a meaning clearly contrary to his ſenſe, and words. You ſpeake
thus: <hi>You in ſaying here,</hi> that, <hi>ſcripture alone cannot be
Iudge, imply that it may bo called in ſome ſenſe a Iudge, though not
abone; yet to ſpeake prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ly (as men ſhould ſpeake when they write of Controverſyes in
Religion) the ſcripture is not a Iudge of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſyes, but a rule only,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the only rule for Chriſtians to iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by</hi> But in this
imputation, you haue no reaſon at all, to interpret <hi>Charity
Maintayned,</hi> as you doe. For, He, in ſaying <hi>Scripture alone cannot be
judge in Controverſyes,</hi> tooke only the contradictory of that, which,
even in this place, you affirme Proteſtants to belieue: Scripture alone is
the judge of Controverſyes, and therfore it was neceſſary, for Him to
declare his mynd, by the contradictory propoſition, that, Scripture alone is
not the judge of Controverſyes, which is very true, though i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Controverſyes, either by itſelfe alone, or in any other ſenſe; and you

againſt the nature of any Writing whatſoever, to be a Judge; and therfore
when you ſay, men ſhould ſpeake properly, when they write of
Controverſyes in Religion, and yet confess that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants 
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:59214:336"/>have called Scripture the. Judge of Controverſyes, and
that to ſpeake properly the Scripture is not a Judge of Controverſyes, you

belonging to interpretation. You ſay; <hi>To execute the letter of the Law,

of a Iudge to moderate it, wherof in Religion there is no vſe at all.</hi> I
pray you, would it not be many tymes vnjuſt, to execute the letter of the
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, taken without a true and moderate interpretation? And for this very

otherwiſe ſome miſcreant might murder his mother and brother, vpon ſome
miſtaken Text of Scripture, that idolaters were to be taken out of the world;
ſubjects might rebell; no warr would be judged law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, no oathes to be

Controverſyes of Religion are decidable by the Scripture, it is manifeſt to
all, but cavillers, that we do and muſt except from this generality, thoſe
which are touching the ſcripture it ſelfe. Iuſt as a Merchant ſhewing a
ſhip of his owne, may ſay, all my ſubſtance is in this ſhipp; and yet
never intend to deny that his ſhipp is part of his ſubſtance, nor yes to
ſay, that his ſhip is in it ſelfe. Or as a man may ſay, that a whole

and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that it may decide this Controverſy concerning it
ſelfe? Doth not Potter (Pag: 141.) ſay; <hi>That Scripture is of Divine
Authority, the believer ſees by that glorious beame of Divine light which

of Catholikes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church, finally reſolve, that Scripture is
knowne to be the Word of God, by certaine criteria, or markes, found in the
Scripture it ſelfe? And therfore it cannot be denyed, but that when
Proteſtants teach, that all Points of Faith may be learned by Scripture, they
muſt either ſay, that this Point of Faith, (Scripture is the word of God)
may be learned by Scripture, or els contradict themſelves, as indeed they
muſt, and for that cauſe, ought to grant, that beſides Scripture, there
is ſome other Meanes, to propoſe Divine Revelations, and Scripture it
ſelfe, with the true interpretation therof. Your examples, may be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt you, by thoſe your Brethren, who deny both the private ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and the Authority of the Church, for aſſuring vs with certainty, that
Scripture is the Word of God; and they will tell you, that if a ſhip muſt
either be within itſelfe, or no where, a marchant, ſhewing a ſhip of his
owne, and ſaying, all my ſubſtance is in this ſhip, muſt either grant
that the ſhip is in itſelfe, or els that he ſpoke vntruly in ſaying all
my ſubſtance is in this ſhip; and the like they would ſay of a
foundation, that if it ſupport the whole houſe, and cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by any thing but by itſelfe, it muſt ſupport it ſelfe; and then they
would informe you, that ſeing not only the contents of Scripture, but alſo
Scripture itſelfe, are objects revealed by God, which revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can neither
be knowne by a private ſpirit, which you and they hold to be a foolery, nor
an infallible Church, which all of you hold to be Papiſtry, it followes,
that. Scripture muſt be believed for itſelfe, or els not be believed at
all. And the ſame we may anſwer, ad hominem, that if the Pope could not be
head of the whole Church, but he muſt be <pb n="953" facs="tcp:59214:337"/>head of
himſelfe, it could not be ſayd, that he is head of the whole, vnless it be
alſo granted, that he is head of himſelfe, but we deny that fond
ſuppoſition, that he cannot be head of the Church, vnless he be head of
himſelfe; as contrarily Proteſtants teach; that the Scripture cannot be
knowne by an infallible Church, nor, by the private ſpirit, and therfore it
muſt be knowne by itſelfe. The ſame they would anſwer to thoſe words,
he hath put all things vnder his feete, that he could not be excepted who did
put all things vnder him, if indeed thoſe firſt words, he hath put all
things vnder his feete, could not be verifyed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he who put all things
vnder his feete, were put vnder him. Neither can you avoide this retortion of
your brethren, except by ſaying, that we do not infallibly belieue Scripture
to be the word of God; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfore there is required no infallibility in

ſay we receiue Scripture, or els, that Scripture is not a materiall object,
which we belieue; or both; as indeed you affirme, both that Faith is not

fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, every one who hath care of his ſoule, muſt out of theſe
inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable labyrinths of Proteſtants, conclude with Catholikes, that for
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving with certainty, that Scripture is the word of God, we muſt rely on
the Church, with this condition alſo, that ſhe be believed to be
infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, which infallibility is abſolutely neceſſary, if once, with
all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, we belieue Chriſtian Faith to be infallibly true.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To your (N. 34.) I anſwer: That all thoſe Bookes of
Scripture, are to be acknowledged for Canonicall which the Church receives for
ſuch: Before which declaration, of the Church, all they were very ſecure,
who differed about ſome Bookes, becauſe they always believed the Authority
of Gods Church, which could not faile to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in due tyme all things
neceſſary for ſalvation. But for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary reaſon, Proteſtants
relying vpon the ſole written word, cannot be ſafe; in regard that they,
not knowing, what Points in particular be neceſſary to ſalvation, to make
all ſure, muſt be obliged to know in particular all that is contayned in
all the Bookes, which diverſe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, even of their owne Sect,
acknowledg to be Canonicall, leaſt otherwiſe, they may chance to remaine in
ignorance, or errour, of ſome matter neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſame Anſwer ſerves for your (N. 36.) For, it
is a Lutheran and Luciferian blaſphemy to ſpeake of Eſther, and diverſe
other Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of Scripture, as Luther ſpeakes of them, after the Definition
of <pb n="654" facs="tcp:59214:338"/>Gods Church to the contrary. Wherof ſee <hi>Charity

Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, may perhaps be altered) I let pass, not to looſe tyme. Only I
cannot omitt your words (N. 47.) directed to <hi>Charity Maintayned: You might
haue met with an Anſwerer that would not haue ſuffered you to haue ſayd
ſo much Truth togeather; but to me it is ſufficient; that it is nothing to

you, you would not haue let me ſay even ſo much Truth togeather.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In your (N. 48.) you ſpeake to <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Out of liberality you will ſuppoſe,
that Scripture, like to a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light, is by it ſelfe alone able to
determine and moue our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to aſſent: Yet not withſtanding
this ſuppoſall, Faith ſtill (you ſay) muſt goe before Scripture,
becauſe as the light is viſible only to thoſe that haue eyes: So the
Scripture only to thoſe that haue the eye of Faith.</hi> Thus you. But it is
reaſon that the words of <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſhould be ſet downe
as they are, and not lamely and imperfectly, as you giue them. Theſe are his
words, (Part: 1. Chap: 1. N. 12. Pag: 52.) <hi>Let us ſuppoſe, (not grant)
that Scripture is like to corporall light, by it ſelfe alone able to
determine, and moue our vnder ſtanding to aſſent; yet the ſimilitude
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves againſt themſelves</hi> (Proteſtants) <hi>for light is not
viſible, except to ſuch as haue eyes, which are not made by the light, but
muſt be preſuppoſed as produced by ſome other cauſe. And therfore to
hold the ſimilitude, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be cleare only to thoſe who are endued
with the eye of Faith, or,</hi> as Potter ſayth (Pag: 141.) <hi>To all that
haue eyes to diſcerne the ſhinning beames therof that is, To the believer,
as immediatly after he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. Faith then muſt not originally proceed
from Scripture, but is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed, before we can ſee the light
therof; and conſequently, there muſt be ſome other-meanes precedent to
Scripture, to beget faith, which can be no other than the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 This is the diſcourſe of <hi>Charity
Maintayned,</hi> and you muſt not contradict it, vnless you will proclaime
your ſelfe a Pelagian, that we are able by our naturall forces, or
vnderſtanding, to belieue as we ought, in order to Eternall Happyneſſe,
as the Eye of our Body can by the naturall abilitie thereof ſee colours. For,
as I ſhewed in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, we being not able of our ſelves, to
produce any one Act <pb n="655" facs="tcp:59214:338"/>of ſupernaturall Divine Faith, need
the Aſſiſtance of the infuſed Habit, of Faith, which is a Theologicall
Vertue, or ſomthing equivalent to it, to enable our vnderſtanding, for the
exerciſe of every ſuch Act; and therfore the aggregatum of our
vnderſtanding, and that Helpe, is for the believing of Scripture, as our
corporall eye is for ſeeing of light, or colours. And then, Scripture will
correſpond to light; our vnderſtanding with that ſupernaturall Helpe, to
our eye; and the Act, of believing to the Act of Seeing. This being premiſed,
it will be found, that either your Objections vaniſh into nothing, or that
you muſt be guilty of Pelagianiſme, as <hi>Chriſtianity Maintayned</hi>
ſayd (Pag: 70.) You ſay: <hi>If Scripture do moue and determine our
vnderſtanding to aſſent, then the Scripture and its moving muſt be
before this aſſent, as the cauſe muſt be before its owne effect, now
this very aſſent is nothing els but Faith, and Faith nothing els than the
vnderſtandings aſſent. And therfore vpon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall, Faith doth
and muſt originally proceed from Scripture, as the effect from its proper
cauſe: and the influence and efficacy of Scripture is to be preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
before the aſſent of Faith, vnto which it moves and determines, and
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently if this ſuppoſition of yours were true, there ſhould need
no other meanes precedent to Scripture to beget Faith, Scripture itſelfe
being able as here you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to determine and moue the vnderſtanding
to aſſent, that is, to belieue them, and the verityes contained in
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. This is your Objection, which goes vpon a falſe
ground, and doth not diſtinguiſh, between the Act, and Habit of Faith, or
ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing eqvivalent to it in actu primo, enabling our vnderſtanding, to
exerciſe ſupernaturall Acts of believing. For, Scripture doth moue and
determine our vnderſtanding only to the Actus ſecundus, or an Act of Faith,
but not to the Habit of Faith, or ſomewhat equivalent to it (which muſt
anſwer to our corporall eye) which cannot be produced by Scripture. If you
had conſidered this Truth, you would not haue gone forward, and ſayd;
<hi>neither is this to ſay, that the Eyes with which we ſee, are made by
the light by which we ſee. For, you are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken much, if you conceiue
that in this compariſon, faith Anſwers to the Eye. But if you will not
peruert it, the Analogy muſt ſtand thus; Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt Anſwer to
light; The eye of the ſoule, that is, the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or the faculty of
aſſenting, to the bodily eye, and laſtly, aſſenting, or believing, to
the Act of ſeeing.</hi> For, I haue told you, that our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in
order to Acts of Faith, alone, cannot be compared to our corporall eye, which
by its owne naturall force can ſee a proportionate <pb n="656" facs="tcp:59214:339"/>object, and ſo your whole Analogy is made voide, and all that you
ground vpon it. Thus we haue heard even Potter ſaying, <hi>That Scripture is
of Divine Authority, the Believer ſees by that glorious beame of light that
ſhines in Scripture.</hi> I would know, of what Beliefe the Doctour
ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akes? Of Faith in Act, or in Habit? If of beliefe in Habit, then they are
Believers, before they ſee that glorious beame of light which ſhines in
Scripture. If he meane, the Act of Faith, then by that Act, he ſees that
glorious beame, which Act muſt therfore be the Eye, wherby he ſaith the
Believer is ſayd to ſee. And he ſpeakes yet more clearly, in theſe
words following; <hi>The Church is the watchman, that holdeth out the light in

(de Circulo) after he had ſpoken much of the light of Scripture, comes to

Where you ſee, he compares Faith to an Eye, and we may aske him, whether he
meane of habituall, or Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Faith, and apply to his Anſwer (whatſoever
it be) the ſame reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I made even now concerning Potters words.
The like dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and Argument may be made againſt the private ſpirit;
which if it be a particular Revelation (that Scripture is the word of God)
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from the Revelations contained in Scripture, it followes, that
Scripture doth not containe all Divine Revelations; and that our
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, with that Revelation, muſt be the eye, wherby Scripture is
ſeene, and not be produced by Scripture. If it be not a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
it muſt be tryed by the Beliefe of Scripture, and ſo that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe muſt
be an eye precedent to the private ſpirit, and conſequently be an eye to
itſelfe, and both come before, and follow itſelfe: yea, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that
ſpirit be, certaine, or vncertaine, a Revelation, or not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, yet
it muſt ſerue for an Eye togeather with the vnderſtanding, to ſee the
Scripture. Wherby it ſtill appeares, that not our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alone, but
it with ſome other Helpe (not produced by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) muſt be compared
to our corporall Eye. The ſame may be ſayd of Barons Criteria, which cannot
be ſeene without ſome particular light of the Holy Ghoſt, and therfore
our vnderſtanding with that light, is the Eye, not produced by the Scripture,
but preſuppoſed to the beliefe of Scripture; And laſtly, you who teach,
that we belieue <pb n="657" facs="tcp:59214:339"/>for the Authority of the Church, muſt
ſay, that the eye wherby we ſee Scripture, is our vnderſtanding togeather
with the Tradition of the Church: Which Tradition therfore muſt be knowne,
and believed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we belieue Scripture, and not be produced by
Scripture.</p>

fruitfull of ſuch monſters</hi> (contradictions) <hi>but they that haue not
ſworne themſelves to the defence of errour will eaſily perceiue, that jam
factum facere, and factum infectum facere, are equally imposſible:</hi> you
ſpeake wickedly, and ignorantly. We haue heard Dr. Taylor (in his Liberty
&amp;c: §. 10. N. 16.) confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that Chriſtians <hi>belieue the
Myſtery of the Trinity with as much violence to the Principles of naturall
and ſupernatur all Philoſophy, as can be imagined to be in the Point of
Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> And it is certaine, that this ſacred Myſtery
of the Trinity, to any learned Philoſopher, containess farr greater
diſſiculty, than any that can be objected, againſt
Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. And yourſelfe, vpon a certaine occaſion, could
ſay to ſome Proteſtants, Either deny the Trinity, or admitt
Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it was anſwered, we will rather admitt this,
than deny that. And with good reaſon. For, if we reſpect humane
diſcourſe, there are, as I ſayd, more difficult objections, againſt
that Myſtery, than againſt this. And if we regard Revelation, Scripture is
more cleare for the reall Preſence, and Tranſubſtantiation, than for the
Myſtery of the B. Trinity. And if regard were to be had of Heretikes, more
haue hertofore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned the Doctrine of the Trinity, than of the Reall
Preſence, and Tranſubſtantiation. But no wonder, if they who reduce all
certainty of Chriſtian Faith, to the weight of naturall Reaſon, taking hold
of the preſent tyme, are glad vnder the name of Tranſubſtantiation, to
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the Doctrine of the B. Trinity, and all the prime verityes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to Chriſtian Faith. The other part of your Affirmation; That, jam factum
facere, and factum infectum facere, are equally impoſſible, is extreme
bold; ſeing ſo many great learned men hold the firſt, and no man the
latter, being betweene them as great difference, as betweene, Eſt, Eſt;
and, Fuit, non fuit. But I feare, you do not vnderſtand, what learned men
meane by a Reproduction of the ſame exiſtent thing, or jam factum facere,
which ſignifyes only that the ſame thing is, and is; wheras every body
knowes, that factum infectum facere is to ſay, That which was, was not; A
manifeſt Contradiction. Yet withall I muſt add, that no Doctrine of the
Catholique Church, doth neceſſarily depend on that Queſtion, Whether it
be impoſſible, jam factum facere. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <pb n="658" facs="tcp:59214:340"/>of

               <p n="16">16. Out of what hath beene ſayd very often, it is
eaſy to anſwer, and retort all that you haue in all your ſections till
the (N. 62.) For, to vs who belieue, the Church of God to be infallible,
diverſity of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or corruptions, can bring no harme; ſeeing we
are ſure, that the Church can neverapproue any falſe Translation, or
corruption, nor ground vpon them any Point of Faith. But for you, who deny the
infallibility of the Church, and rely vpon Scripture alone, falſe
Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations <pb n="660" facs="tcp:59214:341"/>or corruptions, may import no less, than
the loſſe of your ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, by being led into ſome damnable errour, or
left in ignorance of ſome Point neceſſary to ſalvation. For, to rely
vpon Scripture alone, and yet not to know with certainty, what Scripture in
particular is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, and incorrupted, is to take away all certainty from
it, and from the Faith of Proteſtants, grounded on it alone. The Church did
exiſt before any Scripture was written, and muſt laſt, although we
ſhould imagine that all Scripture were loſt, as ſome ſay it happened to
the Old Teſtament; at leaſt it lay hid. Only I muſt note for anſwer to
your (N. 58. and 59.) that, Catholikes object to Proteſtants not only
difference of Tranſlations, of which you ſpeake (N. 59.) but that one of
them moſt deeply condemnes the Tranſlation of the other, as <hi>Ch:
Ma:</hi> (Pag: 52. N. 16.) ſets downe at large. As for the vulgate
Tranſlation, approved by the ſacred Councell of Trent, we are ſure, that
it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine no errour againſt Faith; and for diverſe Readings; we are
certaine, that the Church can never approue any one that is falſe, or
ſettle any doctrine vppon it, as I ſayd even now. But to treate at large of
this Tranſlation, would require a Uolume, and is not for this tyme for my,
(or even your) purpoſe. In your (N. 61,) you pretend to make good, or
excuſe Luther, who in the Text where it is ſaid (Rom: 3.28.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">We account a man to be juſtifyed by
Faith, tranſlates (juſtifyed by Faith Alone:) and in ſtead of proving,
you only ask; What ſuch great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is there between Faith without the

not, without, Alone, ſignifie all one with. Alone, Without?</q> Anſwer:
there is as great difference between thoſe two Propoſitions, as betwene
Truth, and Falſhood. That a man is juſtifyed by Faith without the works of
the Law, is a truth believed both by Catholiques and Proteſtants: for both of
vs belieue, that Faith concurres to juſtification. But that other
Propoſition: A man is juſtifyed by Faith alone without the works of the
Law, ſignifyes that we are not juſtifyed by the works of the Law, but by
Faith alone, that is by nothing but by Faith, which is falſe, and excludes
juſtification by Hope, Charity, and works of Chriſtian piety: and
accordingly Luther being admoniſhed of this ſhamefull falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
anſwered, poenitet me quod non addiderim &amp; illas duas voces, omnibus

ſaith, that there remaineth for <pb n="962" facs="tcp:59214:342"/>men deſirous of

embrace the Communion of Scripture (which had beene a ſtrang kind of

ſee what Baronius anno Chriſti 60. (N. 42. &amp; ſeqq.) writes
excellently of this matter, and demonſtrates that the Latine Church never
rejected that Epiſtle, as he proves out of Authors, who wrote both before,
and after S. Hierome, and that S. Hierome relyed vpon Euſebius, and therfore
your abſolute Aſſertion, that this Epiſtle was rejected in tyme of S.
Hierome, is no leſſe vntrue, than bold. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought you to haue
concealed the anſwer of <hi>Char: Maintayn:</hi> (Part: 2. Chap: 7. Pag:
197.) where he ſaith thus: Wonder not if S. Hierome ſpeake not always in
the ſame manner of the Canon of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince vpon
experience, examination, and knowledge of the ſenſe of the Church, he might
alter his opinion; as once he ſayd (ad Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num of the Epiſtle to the
Hebrews, that it was put out of the number by the greateſt part of men; and
yet elſwere he receives it as the Epiſtle of S. Paul. And if you will haue
a generall explication of S. Herome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his rejecting of Bookes, not
admitted by the Hebrewes, heare it in his owne words (advers: Ruff: Apolog: 2.)
wheras I haue reported what the Hebrewes vſed to object againſt the
Hiſtory of Suſanna, and the Hymne of the Three Children, and the Story of
the Dragon Bel, which are not in the Hebrew: I haue not declared, what I
thought, but what the Jewes were wont to ſay againſt vs, and he calls
Ruſſinus a fooliſh Sycophant, for charging him with the opinion of the
Hebrewes, <pb n="665" facs="tcp:59214:343"/>about theſe parts of Daniel. And S. Hierome
explaining himſelſe in this manner, is acknowledged by Covell (Anſw: to
Bourges Pag: 87.) and Bankcroft (Confer: before his Majeſty:) How then will
you excuſe your Church, which in her ſixt Article, ſaith in generall, of
all the Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes which you eſteeme Apocryphall, among which are the Hiſtory
of Suſanna, the Hymne of the three Children, and that of the Dragon: (The
other Bookes, as S. Hierome ſaith, the Church doth reade for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of
life, and inſtruction of manners: but yet it doth not apply them to
eſtabliſh any Doctrine) How can ſhe (I ſay) be excuſed, ſince S.
Hierome, even according to the Confeſſion of your owne Brethren, doth
explaine himſelfe, that he vttered only what the Jewes were wont to ſay
againſt vs, and cals Ruffinus a fooliſh Sycophant for ſaying the
contrary? So as inſteed of S. Hierome, and the Church of God, you put on the
perſon of Ruffinus againſt S. Hierome, and of the Synagogue, againſt the
Church of Chriſt our Lord; And ſo your whole Canon of the Old Teſtament,
relyes vpon the Authority of the Jewes. Thus far <hi>Charit: Maint:</hi> Which
you did not well to conceale: And while you will not receaue the Canon from the
vniverſall Church before Luther, you ſend men to the Jewes. Now, that S.
Hierome received the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes for Canonicall, appeares out of
his Epiſtle ad Dardanum, where he ſaith of this Epiſtle of S. Paul, and
the Apocalyps of S. John; Nos vtraque ſuſcipimus; we receaue them both,
though we haue heard him ſay before (ad Paulinum) that the Epiſtle to the
Hebrewes was put out of the number by the greateſt part of men. But
howſoever this were, particular Opinyons do nothing concerne the Definitions

interpreted by Her. But in this you ſhew yourſelfe to haue drunke, the very
quinteſſence of Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme.</p>
               <p n="33">33. <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> had Reaſon to ſay (N.
29.) <hi>What good ſtates men would they be, who ſhould ideate, or fancy
ſuch a Commonwealth as theſe men haue framed to themſelves a Church?</hi>
And (N. 22.) <hi>What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to the Church, what danger to the
Commonwealth, this denyall of the Authority of the Church may bring, I leaue to
the conſideration of any judicious, indifferent man.</hi> For if it be free
for every one, to thinke as he pleaſes, who will hinder him, from vttering
his thoughts, in matters which he conceives belong to Faith, and to conforme
his practiſe to his thoughts, and words? And by that meanes ſowe diſcord
in the Church, and ſedition in the Commonwealth. And therfore what you ſay
(N. 122.) that men <hi>only interpret for themſelves,</hi> is not alwaies
true, but their ſelfe interpretation may indeed redound to the hurt of other,
both Private a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Publicke Perſons, and Communityes, if their thoughts, chance
to pitch vpon ſome object, which may be cauſe of miſchiefe.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Howſoever, (N. 118.) You ſeeke to ſhift off the
place of S. Auſtine, which <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> cited (N. 21.) <hi>You
ſee that you goe about to overtrow all Authority of Scripture, and that every
mans mynd may be to himſelfe a rule, what he is to allow, or diſallow in
every Scripture.</hi> (Lib: 32. cont: Fauſt:) Yet it is certaine by Reaſon,
and Experience of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and other, old, and moderne Sectaryes, that
to take away a Living Judge, is to make every mans mynd a Rule, what he is to
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or diſallow in every Scripture. For the Circle, of which you ſpeake
here, and in many other places, I haue ſhewed hertofore at large, that no
ſuch thing can with any probability be objected againſt 
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:59214:347"/>vs, but moſt clearly, and vnanſwerably, againſt
your Brethren.</p>
               <p n="35">35. It ſeemes you were well furniſhed with idle tyme,
when (N. 122. it ſhould be 121.) you could at large examine, and
ſeriouſly exagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, theſe words of <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (Part:
1. Pag: 66. N. 22.) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what goodly ſafe Propounders of Faith ariſe
in place of Gods vniverſall viſible Church, which muſt yield to a
ſingle Preacher; a neighbour; a man himſelfe, if he can read, or at leaſt
haue eares to heare Scripture read.</hi> Which words (good ſafe Propounders
of Faith) who ſees not to be ſpoken ironicè, out of juſt
indignation, that men ſhould reject the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Pope, or Church (as
Potter expreſſly does in that Page 247.) and then ſend vs to the
Declaration, of a particular Preac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, of a Neighbour &amp;c: Surely the
Doctor having rejected the Pope and Church, ſhould haue propoſed, ſome
better and ſafer meanes, and did ill to propound ſuch, as every one ſees
are fallible, and in no wiſe ſafe. But I ſhall be guilty of your fault,
if I ſtay longer vpon ſuch trifles.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Your (N. 123.) hath beene anſwered already, and in
your (N. 124.) you do not ſo much impugne <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> as Dr:
Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cited by Him (Part: 1. Pag: 67. N. 23.) in theſe words: <hi>Dr:
Potter acknowledgeth, that beſides the Law, there was a Living Iudge in the
Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh Church, indued with an abſolutly infallible direction in caſes of
moment; as all Points belonging to Divine Faith are.</hi> The queſtion then
muſt be, not whether Dr: Potter ſpoke true, but whether <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him truly, as I am ſure He did. For, the Doctor,
(Edit: 2. Pag: 25. Lin: 2. a fine.) writes thus: <hi>The High Prieſt in
caſes of moment had a certaine Priviledge from errour, if he conſulted the
divine Oracle by the judgement of Vrim (or by the breaſt-plate of judgement,
wherin were Vrim and Thummim) wherby he had an abſolutly infallible
direction.</hi> Thus He. And that you may ſee he ſpeakes of ſuch an
infallibility, as He denyes to the Pope, and Church; Marke his words immediatly
following: <hi>If any ſuch promiſe from God to aſſiſt the Pope, could
be produced, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions might then juſtly paſſe for Oracles,
without examination; Till then, his words with vs weigh ſo much as his
reaſons, no more</hi> Where you ſee, He grants to the high Prieſt, ſo
great and ſo large, a Priviledge, that <hi>if any ſuch promiſe from God
to aſſiſt the Pope could be produced, his deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions might then
juſtly paſſe for Oracles, without examination.</hi> Which is a large
grant, and from which, every good Chriſtian may well inferr, that, if ſuch
an infallibility were granted to the high Prieſt, and Synagogue 
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:59214:348"/>to the Jewes, much more ought we to yield an abſolute
infallibility, to the Vicar, and Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="37">37, But (N. 124.) You anſwer, or Object, Firſt;
<hi>Where was that infallible direction in the Iewiſh Church, when they
ſhould haue received Chriſt for their Meſſias, and refuſed him? Or
perhaps this was not a caſe of moment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="38">38. Anſwer. Poſſibili poſito in eſſe, nullum
ſequitur abſurdum. Nor is it any wonder, that what was prophecyed, ſhould
be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Perpetuity was not promiſed to the Old Law, (of which it is
ſayd Ezech: 7.26. The Law ſhall periſh from the Prieſt) but to the
Church of Chriſt; of which it is ſayd, the gates of hell ſhall not
prevaile againſt her. The Church is free, and ſignifyed by Sara, wife to
Abraham; the Synagogue was ſignifyed by Agar the bond woman (Gal: 4.24.) Agar
was ſent away, and repudiated, not Sara. The Church is vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, in
reſpect of all that ſhall be ſaved, becauſe none can be ſaved out of
it, as even Calvin expreſſly grants, (Inſtit: Lib: 4. Cap: 1. N. 4.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra ejus gremium nulla eſt
ſperanda peccatorum remiſſio, nec vlla ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</q> But diverſe were
ſaved out of the Synagogue. The Synagogue was not perfect, (Heb: 7.19.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">The Law brought nothing to
perfection.</q> And in this ſenſe, the ceremonyes and Sacraments of the
Synagogue, are called weake and poore elements (Gal. 4.9.) But the Church of
Chriſt is perfect, and the Sacraments of the New Law, not only ſignify, but
giue Grace. For which cauſe S. Auſtine (in Pſalm: 73.) ſaith: 
<q rend="margQuotes">The Sacraments of the new Teſtament
giue ſalvation; the Sacraments of the Old promiſed a Saviour.</q> The
Synagogue contayned a ſhadow of good things to come, (Heb: 10.1.) The Church
hath the light itſelfe, that is Chriſt, (John: 1.9:) No wonder then, if the
ſhaddow faile, when the fullness of light appeares; and no wonder, if our
Saviour being preſent at the Councell of the Jewes, and having ſo preached
the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that after ſome houres he ſayd, Conſummatum eſt, It is
conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate: No wonder, I ſay, if the Jewes might be permitted, at that
tyme to erre. S. Leo (Serm: 6. de Paſſion: ſaith) Tu verò, (he
ſpeakes to Caiphas) 
<q rend="margQuotes">a quo jam alienabatur haec dignitas,
ipſe tibi es executor opprobrij, &amp; ad manifeſtandum finem veteris
inſtituti, pertinet eadem diruptio Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotij.</q> He ſpeakes of Caiphas,
tearing his garments. Contrarily you may remember, that the Prieſts, being
conſulted by Herod, about the Meſſias, did giue a true anſwer
concerning him. Yet good Sir, you may reflect, that the Point for which the
high Prieſt, directly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly <pb n="675" facs="tcp:59214:348"/>ſayd, He hath
blaſphemed, was not becauſe he then expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly pretended to be the
Meſſias, but becauſe he made himſelfe the Son of God; vpon which,
Caiphas did rend his garments, and afterward, they accuſed him before Pilate,
becauſe he made himſelfe the Son of God: and do not you, with other
Socinians, hold it to be indeed a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to ſay, that our Saviour
Chriſt is the Son of God, and conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall to the Eternall Father;
and do they not in their Catechiſme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly ſay, that it is
againſt Scripture, and rectam rationem, right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Which wicked
hereſy of yours being once ſuppoſed to be true, the high Prieſt may
eaſily be excuſed from errour, and blaſphemy, and ſo by this example,
you in particular, ought not to proue that he erred in a caſe of moment, but
that he ſpoke truth. Neither can you blame him, for taking the words of our
Saviour, (that, he was the Son of God) in a litterall ſenſe, ſeing all
orthodoxe Believers vnderſtand it ſo, as indeed it is ſo to be
vnderſtood. And in the meane tyme, are not you true blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, by
whoſe Doctrine, Caiphas may be excuſed from blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? And (ò
impiety!) our Saviour had blaſphemed in making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the Son of God, if
your horrible Doctrine were true.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Secondly, you anſwer, that Dr. Potter <hi>mght
ſay very well, not that the high Prieſt was infallible, (for certainly he
was not) but that his determination was to be of necesſity obeyed, though for
the juſtice of it there was no necesſity that it ſhould be believed.</hi>
But then, how could the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſay, that the <hi>high Prieſt had a
certaine priviledge from errour, wherby he had an abſolutly infallible
direction?</hi> Is not that to be not only obeyed, but of neceſſity
believed, which proceeds from an abſolutly infallible derection? Or how could
the high Prieſts determination be of neceſſity obeyed, if his
determination had beene repugnant to any Point of Faith, as it might haue
happened, if he had no infallible direction? Or will you now grant that one
may, and muſt, diſſemble in matters of Religion? If you grant this
laſt, the ground for which you excuſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants from ſchiſme,
falls to the ground.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Thirdly, you anſwer; <hi>It is one thing to ſay,
that the living judge in the Iewish Church, had an infallible direction:
another, that he was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to follow this direction. This is the
Priviledge which you chalenge. But it is that, not this, which the Doctor
attributes to the Iewes. As a man may truly ſay, the wiſe men had an
infallible direction to Chriſt, without ſaying or thinking that they were
conſtrained to follow it, and could not doe otherwiſe.</hi> This Anſwer
is no more ſolid, and no leſſe repugnant to <pb n="676" facs="tcp:59214:349"/>Dr.
Potter, than the former. For he ſaith: <hi>If any ſuch promiſe from God
to asſiſte the Pope could be produced, his deciſions might then juſtly
paſſe for oracles, without examination.</hi> Now how could any mans
deciſions paſſe for oracles, if the promiſe from God to aſſiſt
him, be not effectuall, but that he may actually reſiſt or reject ſuch an
aſſiſtance, and ſo teach the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of that, towards which he is
aſſiſted by God? Therfore the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor muſt be vnderſtood, of ſuch
an aſſiſtance, as it is certaine, the party aſſiſted will follow,
which is the very Priviledg, which, you ſay, we chalenge, though we ſay
not, that we are neceſſitated, as you miſreport vs; for we know very
well, that there is a great difference, betwixt an abſolute neceſſity,
and infallibility of an effect, as I haue declared her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. And indeed, to
ſay; that the high Prieſt had an infallible aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which in
fact might be reſiſted, is to attribute no more to him, than to every man,
for performing his Duty, if he concurre with Gods inſpirations, and
directions, or ſufficient Grace. Your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſay (N. 148.) That <hi>the
whole depoſitum of truth was commtted to every particular Church, nay to
every particular man, which the Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. And yet no man, I thinke
will ſay, that there was any certainty, that it ſhould be kept whole
inviolate by every man and euery Church.</hi> Which words confirme my ſaying,
that by your interpretation, the Doctor attributes no more to the high
Prieſt, than to every man; which yet we haue ſeene to be directly againſt
his words, and meaning, and that he aſcribes that to the high Prieſt, which
he denyes to the Pope, to whom he profeſſes, that if he granted as much as
God promiſed to the high Prieſt, his (the Popes) <hi>deciſions might
juſtly paſſe for oracles, without examination:</hi> Which ſurely is
more, than is granted to every man; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would either he, or you, deny to
the Pope that ſufficient Grace, and aſſiſtance, to performe his Duty,
which Aſſiſtance you grant to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man. To your example of the wiſe
men: I anſwer; if God did ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſly decree, that the birth of our B.
Saviour, ſhould be publiſhed to the world, by their eye-witneſſing, he
gaue them ſuch direction, as in his infinite wiſdome, he ſaw they would
follow de facto; though without either conſtraint, or neceſſity, as you
would not deny to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible, if you had beene verſed in ſolide
Divinity, or read and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, our Catholike Authors vpon the matter of
Grace.</p>
               <p n="41">41. All that you haue from the (N. 125. till 136.)
incluſiuè, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered already. Only I will ſay, that we do not
proue the Church to be infallible, becauſe ſo it ſeemes to vs moſt
fitt, as you doe, who rely <pb n="677" facs="tcp:59214:349"/>meerly vpon humane
diſcourſe; but ſeing the Queſtion between vs, is, whether the Church,
or Scripture alone, be the infallible Rule, or Judge of Faith, if we proue that
the Church is vſefull for ſuch a purpoſe, and that the Scripture alone
cannot poſſibly be ſuch a Rule, it followes, that not the Scripture can
be ſuch a Rule, but that the Church muſt be a Judge, of Controverſyes.
Thus all your roving arguments through diverſe numbers vaniſh into
nothing.</p>
               <p n="42">42. In the end of your (N. 126.) you ſay that
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vainly that with <hi>monthes and yeares,
as new Canonicall Scriptures grew to be publiſhed, the Church altered Her
Rule of Faith, and Iudge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſyes;</hi> which yet is a true
conſequence, if, as <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> expressly ſayes <hi>as the
Church by little and litle received holy Scripture she was by the like degrees
deveſted of her poſſeſſed Infallibility.</hi> Proteſtants grant
that after the canon was perfited, infallibility ceaſed to be in the Church;
and why muſt they not ſay, that as Bookes of Scripture were written, ſo
ſhe by degrees loſt her infallibility, as being needeless for thoſe
points which grewe to be evidently declared by thoſe Bookes? For which
cauſe they teach that when the whole Scripture was written, the Church wholy
loſt infallibility; and heere enters your conceypt that to him to whom the
way is cleare, a guide is not neceſſary; Therfore the evidence of
Scripture, made infallibility in the Church vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p n="43">43. In your (N. 137. 138.) you diſſemble the force of
<hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> his Argument, which is: the Church was once indued with
infallibility; therfore you cannot affirme, that ſhe loſt it, without
alledging ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Text of Scripture for your aſſertion; which, with
you who rely vpon Scripture alone, ought to be a convincing Argument. Your fond
inſtance about the King of Sweden, with the reſt of that (N. 138.) hath
beene anſwered already.</p>
               <p n="44">44. I need ſay little to your (N. 139.140.) having
confuted at large your diſtinction between being infallible in Fundamentalls,
and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Guide in Fundamentalls. And to your words (N. 140.) directed
to <hi>Charity Maintayned; For the Churches being deprived by the Scripture of
infallibility, in ſome Points, and not in others, that is a wild notion of
your owne, which we haue nothing to doe with.</hi> I Anſwer: if you meane to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the cauſe of Potter, or other Proteſtants, and not of Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
only, you muſt of neceſſity haue to doe with that wild notion. For,
ſeing it muſt be granted, that before Scripture was written, the Church 
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:59214:350"/>was infallible in all matters belonging to Faith both
Fundamentall, and not Fundamentall (becauſe otherwiſe we could not haue
believed Her in any one, and ſo there had beene no meanes to attaine a Divine
infallible Faith) and that after the Canon of Scripture was perſited, the
Church remaines infallible in Fundamentall Articles, but may erre in Points not
Fundamentall, (both which things are granted by Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants:) I hope you
will not deny, but that the concluſion deduced from theſe Premiſes,
muſt be; That ſhe loſt part, and kept part of that infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, with
which ſhe was endued, before Scripture was written: and that you haue an
obligation to ſhew by ſome evident Text of Scripture, that the Church, by
the writing therof, was deprived of infallibility in Points not Fundamentall,
and conſerved with infallibility in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Articles; beſide what I
ſayd even now, that according to your inſtance of a way, the Church
ſhould haue bene deprived of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, when by writing of ſome
Scriptures, ſome points were made cleare in writing, which before were
believed only for the Authority of a Guide, that is, the Church. And now,
conſider whether <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> may not ſay to you, as you
with your wanted humility ſpeake to him, jam dic Poſthume de tribus
capellis.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Your (N, 141.) hath beene anſwered in my
confutation of your (N. 124.) concerning the infallibility of the high Prieſt
and Jewiſh Church. in your (N. 142.) you ſay to <hi>Charity Maintayned; For
particular rites, and ceremonyes, and orders for government, our Saviour only
hath left a generall injunction by S. Paul, let all things be done decently and
in order. But what order is fitteſt, i. e. what tyme, what Place, what Manner
&amp;c: is fitteſt, that he hathleft to the diſcretion of the Governours of
the Church. But if you meane, that he hath only concerning matters of Faith,
preſcribed in Generall, that we are to heare the Church, and left it to the
Church to determine what particulars we are to beliue: The Church being nothing
els but an aggregation of Believers, this in effect is to ſay, He hath left
it to all believers to determine what particulars they are to belieue.
Beſides, it is ſo apparently falſe, that I wonder you could content
yourſelfe, or thinke we ſhould be contented with a bare ſaying without
any ſhew or pretence of proofe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="46">46. Anſwer. My hope was at the firſt general view of
this ſection, to haue anſwered it in very few words. But vpon particular
examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I find it to involve ſo many points of moment, that to vnfold
them, will require ſome little more tyme, and paynes. Firſt, you cite
<hi>Ch: Ma.</hi> 
                  <pb n="679" facs="tcp:59214:350"/>imperfectly. His words (Part: 1. P. 69.
N. 23.) are; 
<q rend="margQuotes">He (Dr. Potter) affirmes, that the
Jewiſh Sinagogue retained infallibility in herſelfe, notwithſtanding the
writing of the old Teſtament; and will he ſo vnworthily and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>juſtly depriue the
Church of Chriſt of infallibility by reaſon of the New Teſtament?
Expecially if we conſider, that in the Old Teſtament, Lawes, Ceremonyes,
Rites, Puniſhments, Judgments, Sacraments, Sacrifices &amp;c: were more
particularly and minutely delivered to the Jewes, than in the New Teſtament
is done, our Saviour leaving the determination, or Declaration of particulars
to his Spouſe the Church, which therfore ſtands in need of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
more than the Jewiſh Synagogue.</q> To theſe words you ſay: <hi>I pray
walke not thus in generality, but tell vs, what particulars?</hi> And then you
diſtinguiſh Rites, and Ceremonyes, and Orders for Governement, from matters
of Faith; which indeed is no diſtinction, if the matter be duly conſidered.
For, although diverſe Rites and Ceremonyes, may chance to be of themſelves
indifferent, and neither forbidden, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to be practiſed, or
omitted; yet to be aſſured, that indeed they are indifferent, and not
ſinfull, or ſuperſtitious, and ſo infectiue of the whole Church, we
need ſome infallible authority. And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly this is true for the
Hierarchy, or Governement of the Church (as I ſayd hertofore) which is a
Fundamentall point, if any can be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, to the conſtituting a
Church. For this cauſe <hi>Charity Maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> expressly ſaid, that
our aviour left to his Church the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or declaration of
particulars; but you thought fit to leaue out the word declaration, wheras we
cannot certainly rely vpon the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of any perſon, or community,
without a power and infallibility to make a Declaration, that the thing
determined or ordained is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and ſo a Determination, or Ordination,
muſt ſuppoſe, or imply in fact, a declaration. Do not you pretend to
leaue vs for our ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Rites, and Ceremonyes, becauſe you could
not in conſcience conforme yourſelves to them? And heere I may put the
Reader in minde of the words which I cited aboue out of Moulin (Epiſt 3 to

particular truth, contained in Scripture, or defined by the Church, which are
millions: And therfore not the Doctrine of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> but

it is <hi>left to all Believers, to determine, what particulars they are to
belieue.</hi> The like may be ſayd of the Councell of Apoſtles, which
conſiſted of the Apoſtles, who determined not only, what others, but what
themſelves were to belieue, if they had not believed it already, (as de facto
they did belieue it before the Councell) and ſo the Apoſtles had
determined, what the Apoſtles were to belieue. The ſame may be applyed to
Generall Councells, who determine even what they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are to belieue;
and vniverſally, if we do conceiue any congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be infallibly
aſſiſted by God, they may declare, what themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and others are to
belieue, though that congregation be nothing but an aggregation of ſuch
Believers. Yourſelfe confess, that, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verners of the Church may
determine Rites, Ceremonies, &amp;c: for the <pb n="681" facs="tcp:59214:351"/>whole
Congregation and ſo for themſelves according to your inference; yea, if you
vnderſtand the matter as you ſhould, in determining Rites &amp;c: they
determine, what every one is not only to practiſe, but to belieue alſo, as
I ſayd aboue; and ſo all believers may determine in this ſenſe, what
they are to belieue. But the truth is, you erre, even in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, not
conſidering, that when a thing is determined by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, endued with
ſufficient Authority, to command, and define, the obligation falls not, vpon
the whole collectiuè, compared with the whole, that is adaequate with it
ſelfe, but as the whole reſpects a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular member, or part, from which
it is truly diſtinguiſhed, as inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens ab incluſo, and the whole a
ſingulis partibns, in the manner, that a mans ſoule is diſtinguiſhed,
from a man. Beſides, the precept of Faith, or Believing, is not a pure
Eccleſiaſticall precept, but a Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, obliging All, and Every
one, to belieue whatſoever the Church propounds as revealed by God, which
therby becomes an Object of Faith. And I hope you will not deny, but that
although it were granted, that a man cannot oblige himſelf, nor a community
it ſelf, by their owne Authority, or command; yet God may, and doth, oblige,
all, and every one, to belieue, whatſoever is propounded as a Divine truth,
by ſuch an infallible Propounder, as the Church is, which, in that ſenſe,
may truly be ſayed to determine what all are to belieue. We may alſo add,
that by the Church are vnderſtood the Paſtours and Prelates ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who
are not the whole Church collectiuè, but may command, and define, for
the whole Church. Laſtly; what doth this your anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Point,
of which <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſpoke? That, there is a greater
neceſſity of ſome infallible authority, in the Church of Chriſt, than
in the Synagogue of the Jewes, becauſe the Lawes, Rites &amp;c were more
particularly, and, as I may ſay, minutely determined in the Old, then in the
New, Law, which therfore ſtands in need of ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Judge to determine,
for all the many varietyes, and different oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, that may preſent
themſelves.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Your (N. 143.) is anſwered in three words, that
when S. Paul, (1. Cor. 16.11.) ſayd, 
<q rend="margQuotes">All theſe thinges chanced to them in
figure;</q> Every body ſees, that he meant not of the temporall, but of the
Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall or ſpirituall ſtate of the Jewes, and ſo if they had
one high Prieſt, who was endued with infallibility, much more ought we to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that there is ſuch an infallibility in Gods Church: And the
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by comparing the words of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> with your
Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <pb n="682" facs="tcp:59214:352"/>will of himſelfe ſee, that you labour to
ſeeke, but can find no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide matter againſt him. Neither did he ever
ſay, that the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Government of the Jewes was a Patterne for
the Eccleſiaſticall Government to Chriſtians (as you would make him
ſpeake) but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly, that the Synagogue was a type and figure of the
Church of Chriſt, (for, thoſe are his words.) Now to be only a type and
figure argues imperfection: To be a Patterne, expreſſes perfection, as
being a Rule, modell, and an idea of that, in reſpect wherof, it is a
Patterne.</p>
               <p n="49">49. You needed not in your (N. 144.) pretend to doubt
what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> meant, when in the beginning of his (N.
24.) he ſayd; 
<q rend="margQuotes">This diſcourſe is excellently
proved by ancient S. Irenaeus.</q> For, it was eaſy to ſee, that he ſpoke
of that diſcourſe which he held in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly precedent (N. 23.) His
diſcourſe was, that the Church of the Old and New Law did exiſt
(reſpectiuè) before any Scripture was written, as there he ſhewes at
large, and conſequently, that Tradition, and not ſcripturedid then beget
faith; which is alſo clearly confirmed, by the place which <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi>
cited (N. 24.) out of S. Irenaeus, whoſe meaning you do pervert againſt
himſelfe, and even againſt yourſelfe. The words of the Saint (Lib: 3.
Cap: 4.) are; 
<q rend="margQuotes">What if the Apoſtles had not left
Scriptures, ought we not to haue followed the order of Tradition, which they
delivered to thoſe, to whom they committed the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? To which order many
Nations yield aſſent, who belieue in Chriſt, having ſalvation written
in their harts by the ſpirit of God, without letters or inke, and diligently
keeping ancient Tradition. It is eaſy to receaue the truth from Gods Church,
ſeing the Apoſtles haue moſt fully depoſited in her, as in a rich
ſtorehouſe, all things belonging to truth. For what? If there ſhould
ariſe any contention of ſome ſmall queſtion, ought we not to haue
recourſe to the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Churches, and from them to receiue what is
certaine and cleare concerning the preſent queſtion?</q> Theſe be the
words of S. Irenaeus cited by <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> which declare, that
Tradition is ſufficient, and powerfull, to produce Faith, even with facility,
(as S. Irenaeus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelfe) though no Scripture had beene
written: And this he affirmes, not by way of conjecture, or diſcourſe, what
God would haue done, if there had beene no Scriptures, but that, de facto,
there was exiſtent ſuch a powerfull Tradition, as to it not one, nor
ſome, nor few, but many nations did yield aſſent without letters or inke,
that is, without Scripture: And in this Chapter, (N. 159.) you ſay; Irenaeus 
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:59214:352"/>
                  <hi>tells vs of ſome barbarous Nations that believed
the doctrine of Chriſt, and yet believed not the Scripture to be the word of
God; for they never heard of it and Faith comes by hearing.</hi> From whence
you inferr, That a man <hi>may be ſaved, though he ſhould not know, or not
belieue Scripture to be the word of God, if he belieue Chriſtian Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
wholly and entirely, and liue according to it.</hi> If this be true, doth it
not follow, that Scripture alone is not the only, nor a neceſſary Rule of
Faith, ſeing by tradition alone, men may be ſaved, though they <hi>ſhould
not know, or not belieue Scripture to be the word of God?</hi> And that by this
conceſſion, you directly blott out, the very title of this Chapter, which
is, <hi>Scripture the only Rule wherby to judge of controverſyes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="50">50. Now let vs heare, what you can Object againſt
<hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned,</hi> in this matter. You ſay: (N. 144.) <hi>In
ſaying, what if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had not left Scripture, ought we not to haue
fellowed the order of Tradition? And in ſaying, that to this order many
Nations yield aſſent, who belieue in Chriſt, having ſalvation written
in their harts, by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, without letters or inke, and
diligently keeping ancient Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; doth he</hi> (S. Irenaeus) <hi>not
plainly ſhew, that the Tradition he ſpeakes of, is nothing els, but the
very ſame that is written: Nothing but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e in Chriſt? To which, whether Scripture alone,
to them that belieue it, be not a ſufficient Guide, I leaue to you to
Iudge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="51">51. Anſwer: Firſt, this your Anſwer, though it were
never ſo true, leaves <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in poſſeſſion, of
what he endeavoured to proue out of S. Irenaeus, againſt the Title of your
Chapter <hi>(Scripture the only Rule wherby to Iudge of Controverſyes)</hi>
to witt, that Tradition, and therfore not only Scripture, is ſuch a Rule.
For, dato non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſo, that Scripture containes all Points neceſſary
to be believed, it followes not that the Church alſo may not be infallible,
and guide vs by Tradition, as by Gods vnwritten Word. You teach here, (N. 126.)
That, all the <hi>neceſſary Parts of the Goſpell are contained in every
one of the foure Goſpells;</hi> And yet you ſay, That <hi>they which had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll the Bookes of the New
Teſtament, had nothing ſuperfluous: For, it was not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous but
profitable, that the ſame thing ſhould be ſayd diverſe tymes, and be
teſtifyed by diverſe witneſſes.</hi> So, ſay I, it had not beene
ſuperfluous, but very profitable, that the ſame truth ſhould be revealed
by God in Scripture, and by the infallible Tradition of the Church, which you
muſt grant to haue happened in the tyme of the Apoſtles; when the firſt
Bookes of Scripture were Written. For, as Scripture was not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
though it found another infallible Rule before it, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo 
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:59214:353"/>even according to Proteſtants, remained for ſome tyme
with it (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely till the Canon of Scripture was perfited) ſo Tradition
neither was, nor is, ſuperfluous, though there be another infallible Rule
(Scripture) with it.</p>
               <p n="52">52. Secondly: When you ſay, That the <hi>Tradition S.
Irenaeus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of, is nothing els, but the very ſame what is written;
nothing but to belieue in Chriſt; to which, whether Scripture alone, to them
that belieue it</hi> (you ſhould add, and vnderſtand it) <hi>be not a
ſufficient Guide, I leaue to you to Iudge:</hi> I muſt anſwer, as you (N.
142.) ſpeake to <hi>Charity Maintayned; I pray walke not thus in generality,
but tell vs,</hi> what you meane by believing? Only in generall, that he is the
Meſſias, and that without believing him, none can be ſaved? Or elſe do
you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, by believing in Chriſt, all that hath beene taught by him?
If you meane the firſt only; you ſay nothing to the purpoſe; becauſe
other Articles, are neceſſarily to be believed, beſide that of Chriſts
being the Meſſias. If you meane the ſecond; that is, all Points taught by
our Saviour, and neceſſary to be believed, as you (N. 159.) ſay; <hi>S.
Irenaeus tells vs of ſome babarus Nations, that believed the Doctrine of
Chriſt;</hi> (which certainly containes more than that one generall Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of his being Meſſias, as even there you declare, that it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the
Believing of Chriſtian Religion, wholly and entirely; that is, <hi>(the
matter of the Gospell)</hi> you know we deny, that for all ſuch truths,
Scripture alone can be a ſufficient Guide, and to take the contrary without
proofe, is to begg the queſtion. Nay, even for that of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in
Chriſt, I wonder you would ſay, that you <hi>leaue it to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
Charity Maintayned,</hi> that Scripture alone is a ſufficient Guide, (in the
Principles, and proceedings of Proteſtants) ſeing you know that He knowes,
and the whole world knowes, how vaſtly they diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree about believing in
Chriſt, ſome believing him to be the Son of God, and Conſubſtantiall to
his Father: Others denying it: Some ſaying, he ſatiſfyed for our ſins,
others denying it, as you know the Socinians doe. So that, take away the
Authority and infallibility of Gods Church, the agreement of Chriſtians in
believing in Chriſt, will terminate in the meere Name of Chriſt, and the
Title of Saviour, with endless contentions, about the Thing ſignifyed by that
Name, and Title. Put then all your Aſſertions togeather, the ſtrength of
them will end in this contradiction, that the only Rule of Faith is
Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet that a man may be ſaved without believing it to be
the Word <pb n="685" facs="tcp:59214:353"/>of God, yea though he doubt or reject it, being
propoſed by other Parts of the Church, as you expreſſly ſay in the
ſame (N. 159.)</p>
               <p n="53">53. But, you ſay, S. Irenaeus his words <hi>are juſt
as if a man ſhould ſay, if God had not given vs the light of the Sun, we
muſt haue made vſe of candles and torches: If we had had no eyes, we muſt
haue felt out our way: If we had no leggs, we muſt haue vſed crutches. And
doth not this in effect import, that while we haue the Sun, we need no candles?
While we haue our eyes, we need not feele out our way? While we enjoy our
leggs, we need not crutches? And by like reaſon, Irenaeus in ſaying, if we
had had no Scripture, we muſt haue followed Tradition, and they that haue
none, do well to doe ſo, doth he not plainly import, that to them that haue
Scripture, and belicue it, Tradition is vnneceſſary? Which could not be, if
the Scripture did not containe evidently the whole Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="54">54. Anſwer: You may vnderſtand the words of S.
Irenaeus, and moue others to vndeſtand them as you pleaſe; if you will
firſt ſuppoſe, your owne doctrine to be true, that is, if to begg the
queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may paſſe for a good Rule, to interpret Authors. If I ſay,
you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or take as granted, that Scripture is the only Rule of Faith;
and, that it containes evidently all things neceſſary to ſalvation; you
may compare it to the Sun, to Eyes, to leggs; and the Church to Candles; to
feeling out our way; to crutches; yea (if ſhe might erre,) to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue
of Satan, and laſtly to Nothing, becauſe indeed every er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in Faith,
deſtroyes Faith, and Church. But if you conceaue as you ought, that the
Church gives Being to the Scripture in order to vs; that by Her Eyes, or
Teſtimony, we belieue Scripture to be the word of God, as yourſelfe grant;
that by Her ſubſiſtence, as I may ſay, it hath beene conſerved and
ſubſiſts; you will be forced, to invert your ſimilitudes, and
interpretation of S. Irenaeus, and ſay; do not his words import, that if
candles ſhould faile, the Sun will laſt, and (as the Prophet David ſaith
Pſalm: 18.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Nec eſt qui ſe abſcondat a calore
ejus:</q> And that in Sole poſuit tabernaculum ſuum, that is, in
mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtatione Eccleſiam, ſaith S. Auſtine. If through the difficulty
and obſcurity of Scripture we cannot feele out our way, (as the
diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Proteſtants ſhew, they cannot) we may ſee by the eyes
of the Church, by which we did firſt ſee Scripture itſelfe, and then, do
not the words of S. Irenaeus plainly import, the direct contrary of that which
you inferr? That to them who haue Tradition (as all they muſt haue, who
belieue Scripture, which we receiue by Tradition) Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture 
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:59214:354"/>is vnneceſſary, (as you ſpeak of Tradition) and
ſo is not to be the only Rule of Faith; nor is there any neceſſity at
all, that it containe evidently the whole Tradition, as you inferr, which is
moſt evidently falſe, ſeing S. John writes, that the world, could not
containe all, that might haue been written, of our B. Saviour. To ſay
nothing, that one Tradition, and that the chiefeſt of all other, in the
account of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, is, that Scripture is the Word of God, which you
profess cannot be proved by Scripture itſelfe.</p>
               <p n="55">55. And, now we haue a cleare Anſwer to your Objection
out of S. Irenaeus, (as if he had taught that Scripture containes evidently the
whole Tradition.) You cite not the place: But it is (Lib: 3. Cap: 1.) where he
ſaith: <hi>We haue received the diſpoſition of our ſalvation from no
others, but from them, by whom the Goſpell came vnto vs. VVhich Goſpell
truly the Apoſtles firſt preached, and afterwards by the will of God,
delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in writing, to vs, to be the Pillar and Foundation of our
Faith.</hi> Theſe words you alledge, and in your margent cite Bellarmine (de
Verbo Dei Lib: 4. Cap: 11.) anſwering them much to your advantage, as you
pretend. But you diſſemble his firſt Anſwer, which demonſtrates that
S. Irenaeus doth in no wiſe favour your pretence. Bellarmine in Anſwer to
Kemnitius who made this ſame Objection out of S. Irenaeus, ſaith; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Reſpondeo, Irenaeum non dicere, nihil
aliud Apoſtolos predicaviſſe, quàm quod ſcripſerunt, ſed
ſolùm ſcripſiſſe Evangelium quod antea praedicaverant, quod
eſt verum, &amp; non contra nos. I anſwer, that S. Irenaeus doth not
aſſirme, the Apoſtles to haue preached nothing els beſide that which
they wrote: but only that they wrote the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell which they had preached
before, which is true, and not againſt vs.</q> Now how can you impugne this
Anſwer of Bellarmine, otherwiſe than by begging the queſtion, and
ſuppoſing, that the Evangeliſts, cannot be ſayd to haue Written the
Goſpell, vnless they wrote all that the Apoſtlès preached? Which you
know we deny, and the contrary is evident out of S. John, as I ſayd even now,
and hertofore proved at large: Though it be alſo moſt true, that they wrote
all that was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be written; but then you muſt proue, that all
that was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed, or was preached, was neceſſary to
be written, (and not delivered by Gods vnwritten Word, or Tradition, as it was
before any Scripture was extant) which you will never be able to proue out of
S. Irenaeus, or Holy Scripture. This Anſwer to the words of S. Irenaeus is
confirmed out of the ſame Chapter, where he ſaith, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus <pb n="687" facs="tcp:59214:354"/>Diſcipulus &amp;c: Marke the Diſciple and interpreter of Peter
did alſo deliver to vs in writing thoſe things which were preached by
Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Luke the follower of Paul ſet downe in a Booke the Goſpell
which was preached by him. (S. Paul.) And afterward John the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our
Lord, and who leaned vpon his breſt, did alſo write the Goſpell while he
remained at Epheſus in Aſia.</q> Now it cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that S.
Marke had many things from the mouth of S. Peter, and S. Luke from S. Paul,
which they did not ſet downe in writing; and yet you ſee, it is ſayd, he
(S. Luke) wrote Evangelium, the Goſpell; and for S. John, he profeſſes,
that our Saviour did innumerable things, which are not written, and yet it is
ſayd, edidi Evangelium, he ſet forth the Goſpell, and the Apoſtles
delivered interpretations of Scripture to the firſt Chriſtians, which are
not ſet downe in writing, as yourſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. If any ſay, S.
Irenaeus calls Scripture the Pillar and Foundation of our Faith. I anſwer:
Thoſe words cannot be referred, Scripturis, to the Scriptures, (which is S.
Irenaeus his word) but to the Goſpell, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res by the Word, futurum,
(fundamentum &amp; columnam Fidei noſtrae futurum) ſeing we cannot ſay,
with congruity of Grammar, Scripturis futurum, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfore it muſt be
referred to Evangelium, Goſpell, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium columnam Fidei noſtrae
futurum, which (Goſpell) is of a larger extent, than Scripture; though no man
denyes, Scripture to be, in a good ſenſe, the Pillar and Fundation of
truth. Of the ſecond anſwer which Bellar gives, I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> largely
(Chap: 2.) and ſhewed how egregiouſly you abuſe him againſt his direct
intention, meaning, and words.</p>
               <p n="56">56 Thus you haue an anſwer to your (N. 145.) Where you
ſay, that <hi>at the moſt we can inferr from S. Irenaeus but only a
ſuppoſitiue neceſſity of having an infallble Guide, and that grounded
vpon a falſe ſuppoſition, in caſe, we had no Scripture, but an
abſolute neceſſity herof, and to them who haue and belieue the Scripture,
which is your aſſumption, cannot with any colour from hence be concluded,
but rather the contrary.</hi> The Anſwer, I ſay, to this, is given already;
for, as I ſayd, S. Irenaeus ſpeakes not by way of diſcourſe, or
conjecture, or as it were of prophecy, what God would haue done, in caſe the
Apoſtles had left no Scriptures, but he ſpeakes of Tradition really
exiſting, wherby the want of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might haue beene ſupplyed, and
which he expreſſly ſaith, the Apoſtles <hi>delivered to thoſe, to
whom they committed the Churches;</hi> Yea, he affirmes, that, de facto, many
Nations were converted, by yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding aſſent to it; and ſo, de facto,
there was, in that, and will be, in the like, caſe, a neceſſity of an
infallible Tradition, and a Living <pb n="688" facs="tcp:59214:355"/>Guide: And although
that, or the like occaſion, had not happened, yet the thing being contingent
(Yea and in your particular Doctrine, the Scripture being not a materiall
Object of Faith, which all are bound to belieue, which in effect is, as if it
were not at all) the Church could not be to ſeeke, whenſoever the
occaſion might happen, but muſt be indued with a permanent Authority, and
infallibility, for all events; as it is contingent, that, for example, theft be
committed in a Commonwealth; yet there is not only a ſuppoſitiue, but an
abſolute neceſſity, that the Commonwealth be indued with an abſolute
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant power, to puniſh theeves &amp;c: Neither ought you to ſay
abſolutly, (for as much as belongs to our queſtion) that it is a falſe
ſuppoſition, to ſuppoſe that Scripture had not beene written. For,
(beſides that the Church of Chriſt was in being, ſome yeares before any
part of the New Teſtament was written) it is all one, that there be no
Scripture, and that we haue it not, or haue no reaſon to belieue it, yea or
may reject it, as you ſaie; ſeing therfore, many Nations were ſaved,
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge of Scripture, or any obligation to know it, as S. Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vs
ſuppoſes, it alone is, in order to vſe, and vs, as if it had never beene
written; and ſo, as I ſayd, inferrs an abſolute, and not only a
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitiue neceſſity of ſome Living Guide. And this, it ſeemes,
you did perceiue, when you ſayd, that <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> did not
well, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr an abſolute neceſſity of a Living Guide, to them who
haue, and belieue the Scripture: Wherby you muſt ſignify, that to thoſe,
who either haue not Scripture, or haue not ſufficient reaſon to belieue it,
it is all one, as if Scripture had never beene written, and conſequently,
that de facto there is an abſolute neceſſity of an infallible Guide. Nay,
men could not haue had ſufficient reaſon to belieue infallibly the
Scripture, except for the Authority of the Church of God, which therfore muſt
be believed to be abſolutely infallible before any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be believed;
which is directly contradictory to your ſaying, that the neceſſity of an
infallible Guide is grounded vpon a falſe ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in caſe we had
no Scripture. For, contrarily, if we haue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue Scripture, we muſt
firſt belieue an infallible Church, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of that ſuppoſition,
and vpon which that ſuppoſition of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Scripture muſt
depend.</p>
               <p n="57">57. But it ſeemes, this Authority of S. Irenaeus doth
yet vex you. And therfore (N. 146. 147. 148.) you ſay: That in <hi>S.
Irenaeus his tyme all the Churches were at an agreement about the Fundamentalls
of Faith, <pb n="689" facs="tcp:59214:355"/>which vnity was a good aſſurance, that what
they ſo agreed in, came from ſome one common fountaine, and they had no
other then of Apoſtolique Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="58">58. This I haue anſwered hertofore, and told you, that
when the Fathers alledge the Authority of the Church, or Tradition, they
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Church to be abſolutly infallible, and not only, that
acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, ſhe teaches at that tyme the truth, which had beene no proofe,
but a meere petitio principij. For, if the Church might erre, as you ſay
ſhe hath done, the Heretikes againſt whom the Fathers wrote, would eaſily
haue anſwered, that all Churches might erre, and had erred, in ſuch, or
ſuch particular Points; and how could you, or any Proteſtant, impugne
ſuch an Anſwer, ſuppoſing once the Church could erre? When Luther
appeared, he forſooke the Faith, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, of all Churches, vpon
pretence, that they all agreed in errours againſt Scripture; and how do you
now tell vs, that the agreement of Churches <hi>was a good aſſurance that
what they ſo agreed in, came from ſome one common fountaine, and they had
no other but Apoſtolicall Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</hi> In this manner hertofore I
retorted againſt you the ſaying, which you alledge out of Tertullian,
(<hi>Variaſſe debuerat</hi> &amp;c: <hi>If the Churches had erred, they
could not but haue varied, but that which is one amongſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, cannot
be errour, but Tradition:</hi>) That, ſeing all Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in a beliefe
contrary to the Faith of Proteſtants, we muſt affirme, that <hi>the thing
which is one among ſo many, can not by errour but Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And your
words here, add a particular ſtrength to my retortions, while you ſay, that
the agreement and vnity of Churches about the Fundamentalls of Faith, is a good
aſſurance, that what they ſo agree in, comes from the common fountaine of
Apoſtolique Preaching. For, thoſe Heretikes might haue anſwered, that the
errours of the Church which they impugned, were not Fundamentall (as we haue
proved, that you ſay the errours of the Roman Church, and ſuch as agreed
with Her when Luther appeared, were not Fundamentall) and ſo the
aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, taken from vnity in Fundamentalls, could be no Argument
againſt them. Beſides, I pray you, reflect on your ſaying, that,
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants departed not from the whole Church, becauſe they were a part
therof, and they departed not from themſelves, and then you cannot but ſee,
that thoſe Heretikes in S. Irenaeus his tyme, might haue ſayd, all Churches
are not at an agreement about matters of Faith, ſeing we who are a part of
the Church, do not agree with the <pb n="690" facs="tcp:59214:356"/>reſt; and therfore
the agreement which you ſpeake of, is of no force againſt vs, but you
muſt proue by ſome other kind of Argument, that our doctrines are falſe;
juſt as Proteſtants anſwer vs, when we object againſt them the
agreement of all Churches againſt the doctrine of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he firſt
appeared. Wherfore I muſt ſtill inferr, that it is not the actuall, or
accidentall agreement, but the conſtant ground therof (that is, the
infallibility of the Church) that muſt aſſure vs, what is Orthodoxe, and
what is Hereticall doctrine. Moreover, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas you ſay, <hi>In S. Irenaeus
his tyme all the Churches were at an agreement about the Fundamentalls of
Faith:</hi> I beſeech you, informe vs, how it could be otherwiſe then; how
can it be otherwiſe now; how ſhall it be otherwiſe for the tyme to come;
or for any imaginable tyme, than that all Churches are at an agreement in
Fundamentalls of Faith? Seing you profeſſe through your whole Booke, that
if they faile in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, they ceaſe to be Churches; and ſo it is as
neceſſary for all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to agree in Fundamentalls, as for all men to
agree in the eſſence of man: And you might as well haue ſayd, that at S.
Irenaeus his tyme, the Definition did agree, or was all one with the Definitum,
as that all Churches agreed in Fundamentalls. If therfore it was eaſy to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the truth from Gods Church in S. Irenaeus his tyme, as he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
and you grant, it will be no leſſe eaſy to doe it in theſe our ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
ſeing the Church can never faile in Fundamentall Points of Faith, and ſo it
was eaſy for Luther, and his companions, to haue received the truth, or
rather to haue retained the truths, they found in the Church, ſeing ſhe was
a true Church, and conſequently did not erre in Fundamentall Points. From
whence it followes, that when S. Irenaeus ſaith, <hi>the Apoſtles haue
moſt fully depoſited in the Church, as in a rich ſtore-houſe, all
things belonging to truth,</hi> it muſt be vnderſtood, that ſhe cannot
but keepe that depoſitum ſincere for Fundamentall Points, even according to
Proteſtants; and you ſay here (N. 164.) <hi>The viſible Church ſhall
always without faile propoſe ſo much of Gods Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as is
ſufficient to bring men to Heaven, for otherwiſe it will not be the
viſible Church,</hi> in which ſenſe, that depoſitum is not committed to
private perſons, though otherwiſe never ſo qualifyed, and therfore all
that you haue (N. 148.) is of no force, even in the Principles of
Proteſtants. And then further, ſeing indeed any errour againſt divine
Revelation, is damnable, and without Repentance deſtroyes ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as
you grant; it is impoſſible, that the Church (which muſt needs 
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:59214:356"/>enjoy all things neceſſary to ſalvation, as we haue
heard you even now ſaying, <hi>the viſible Church ſhall always without
faile, propoſe ſo much of Gods Revelation, as is ſufficient to bring men
to Heaven</hi>) It is, I ſay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſiblle, that the Church can fall into
any damnable Errour, but muſt be vniverſally infallible. Which is
vnanſwerably confirmed, by your doctrine, that it is impoſſible to know
what Points in particular be Fundamentall, and ſo we cannot know, that ſhe
failes not to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo much of Gods Revelation, as is ſufficient
to bring men to Heaven,</hi> vnless we belieue Her, to be infallible in all
Points of Faith, as well not Fundamentall, as Fundamentall. And here againe,
how could you ſay, that in <hi>S. Irenaeus his tyme all the Churches were at
an agreement about the Fundamentalls of Faith, which vnity was a good
aſſurance that what they ſo agreed in, came from ſome one common
fountaine, and they had no other than Apoſtolique Preaching:</hi> How, I
ſay, could you ſpeake thus, your doctrine conſidered, that we cannot know
what Points are Fundamentall, and ſo we cannot know, whether Churches be at
an agreement in them, and conſequently, cannot, from ſuch an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in
Fundamentalls, haue a good <hi>aſſurance, that what they ſo agreed in,
came from the fountaine of Apoſtolique Preaching?</hi> Every where you are
found clearly to contradict yourſelfe.</p>
               <p n="59">59. In anſwer to your (N. 149.150.151.152.153.) I will
firſt ſet downe the words of <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> and then anſwer
what you object. Thus ſaith <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> (Part: 1. Pag: 71.
N. 25.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">The doctrine of Proteſtants is
deſtructiue of itſelfe. For, either they haue certaine and infallible
meanes not to erre in interpreting Scripture, or they haue not. If not; then
the Scripture (to them) cannot be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ground for infallible Faith,
nor a meete Judge of Controverſyes. If they haue certaine infallible meanes,
and ſo cannot erre in their interterpretations of Scripture; then they are
able with infallibility to heare, examine, and determine all Controverſyes of
Faith, and ſo they may be, and are, Judges of Controverſyes, although they
vſe the Scripture as a Rule. And thus, againſt their owne doctrine, they
conſtitute another Judge of Controverſyes, beſide Scripture
alone.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="60">60. Againſt this diſcourſe, you object with great
pompe of words: If we (Catholiks) haue certaine, and infallible meanes, for the
choyſe of the Church, then we are able with infallibility to determine all
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſyes of Faith, although we pretend to make the Church our Guide.
And then ſay you (N. 149.) We <hi>conſtitute another Iudge of
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſyes, <pb n="692" facs="tcp:59214:357"/>beſides the Church alone; nay every
one of vs makes himſelfe a chooſer of his owne Religion, and of his owne
ſenſe of the Churches decrees, which very thing we ſo highly condemne in
Proteſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="61">61. Anſwer. we haue certaine meanes to belieue with an
infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Faith, that the Catholique Church is an infallible Judge of
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſyes, as we haue proved hertofore at large, in diverſe
Occaſions. But then to ſay, that by this meanes, i.e. by believing the
Church to be the Judge of controverſyes, we are able of our ſelves, with
<hi>infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to determine all controverſyes, and do conſtitute
another Iudge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſyes, beſides the Church alone.</hi> I am ſo
farr from vnderſtanding it that to me it ſeemes no better than
non-ſenſe; as a man, who in ſome cauſe, makes choyſe of a Iudge, whom
he believes to be juſt, wiſe, and in every reſpect fit for ſuch an
office, cannot be ſayd to conſtitute another judge, beſide him, of whom
he makes choiſe, nor to make himſelfe Iudge. Do you not teach, that the
Church propoſes to vs Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scripture, and that Scripture is the ſole
Rule of Faith, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all controverſyes are determined? and yet you will not
inferr from thence, that the Church is a Rule of Faith, wherby all
controverſyes are determined, and not Scripture alone. It is you, who here
(N. 153) ſay; <hi>for the latter part of this inference,</hi> that every one
makes himſelfe <hi>judg of</hi> controverſyes <hi>we acknowledge and
embrace it. We do make ourſelves Iudges of controuerſyes.</hi> And this you
muſt grant, not only for the choyſe of your Religion, but for the ſenſe
of Scripture, and conſequently for deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining all controverſyes of Faith,
and ſo you are Iudges of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſyes, as <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> inferred;
wheras Catholikes in all controverſyes, hold themſelves obliged to follow
the determination of the Church, and not of their owne vnderſtanding, as you
doe. How farr we may, and do make vſe of Reaſon in matters of Religion, we
haue declared aboue. And even yourſelfe (Pag: 376. N. 56.) ſpeaking of
Scripture, ſay; <hi>Propoſe me any thing out of this Booke, and require
whether I belieue it, or not, and ſeeme it never ſo incomprehenſible to
humane reaſon, I will ſubſcribe with hand and hart, as knowing no
demonſtration can be ſtronger than this: God hath ſayd ſo; therfore it
is true.</hi> Which words, though they cannot be ſpoken ſincerely, and with
conſequence, by you who reſolue Faith into humane probable Arguments of
reaſon; yet they ſhew, that even in reaſon, Reaſon ought to ſubmitt
to Authority. We haue alſo ſhewed, the difference between the Scripture,
which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, and the Decrees of the Church, which, in all
occaſions, <pb n="693" facs="tcp:59214:357"/>can clearly declare Her meaning, if any
difficulty occurre, about her former Decrees, or Definitions.</p>
               <p n="62">62. But I pray, where did <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi>
frame this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which you (N. 150.) terme <hi>a tranſparent fallacy?
Proteſtants haue no meanes to interpret, without errour, obſcure and
ambiguons places of Scripture; therfore plaine places of Scripture cannot be to
them a ſufficient ground of Faith.</hi> You know, there neither is, nor can
be any Queſtion at all, whether plaine places, be not plaine, to thoſe, to
whom they are plaine; nor whether ſuch plaine places, may not be a
ſufficient ground of Faith, in reſpect of perſons, to whom, and Matters,
wherin, they are plaine. The Point is, and you know it to be ſo, whether
ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be plaine, in all Points neceſſary to be believed, which we
deny, and you often affirme, but can never be able to proue; and I haue
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that even thoſe Texts, which you pretend to be moſt
plaine, and expreſly alledge for inſtances of ſuch plaineſſe, are not
ſuch, but containe difficulty, if we reſpect the ſenſe, and not the
bare words, which may be plaine to Pagans, Jewes, Turkes, and to all who
vnderſtand the language in which Scripture was written. And therfore you do
not ſatisfy your owne Demand, wherin you ſpeake thus to <hi>Charity
maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If you aske me, how I can be ſure that I know the true meaning
of theſe (plaine) places? I aske you againe, can you be ſure, that you
vnderſtand what I or any man elſe, ſayes? They that heard our Saviour and
the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les preach, could they haue ſufficient aſſurance, that they
vnderſtood at any tyme, what they would haue them doe? If not, to what end
did they heare them? If they could, why may not we be as well aſſured, that
we vnderſtand ſufficiently, what we conceiue plaine in their
writings?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="63">63. Anſwer. If he who ſpeakes, be not ſufficiently
vnderſtood, he may be asked, and he who askes, may be ſatisfyed, by a
further decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſpeaker, which holds not in Scripture, as I am
forced of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to repeate, Beſides, when things are ſpoken, the preſent
Tyme, Place, Argument, and other circumſtances, may giue much more light,
than when they are barely written, deveſted of ſuch helpes. In which
caſe, if a word can be found, but once, in the whole Bible, to ſignify
ſuch, or ſuch a thing, perhaps it may breede a doubt, whether in other
places it be not ſo taken; of which, no doubt would haue beene made, in
caſe that in all places it had the ſame ſignification, Yea, we ſee,
that the Apoſtles did not always vnderſtand our B. Saviours words, till he
vouchſafed to declare them. And I obſerue your owne words; 
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:59214:358"/>
                  <hi>May we not be as well aſſured, that we
vnderſtand ſufficiently, what we conceiue plaine, in their</hi> (the
Apoſtles) writings? Where inſine, your certainty and evidence is reſolved
into (what we conceiue) which are your owne words; and is a poore ground, for
an Act of infallible Faith; and, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants diſagreeing among
themſelves, doth not every one, conceiue Scripture to be plaine, in his
favour? And yet it is plaine, that two contradictoryes cannot be true.</p>
               <p n="64">64. In your (N. 152.) you ſpeake to <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> in this manner: <hi>In ſaying, If they haue certaine meanes,
and ſo cannot erre, me thinkes you forgett yourſelfe very much, and ſeeme
to make no difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween having certaine meanes to doe a thing, and the
actuall doing of it. As if you ſhould conclude, becauſe all men haue
certaine meanes of ſalvation, therfore all men certainly muſt be ſaved,
and cannot doe otherwiſe; as if whoſoever had a horſe, muſt preſently
get vp and ride, whoſoever had meanes to fynd out a way, could not neglect
thoſe meanes, and ſo miſtake it. If you aske, ſeing we may posſibly
erre, bow can we be aſſured we do not? I aske you againe, ſeing your
eye-ſight may deceiue you, how can you be ſure you ſee the ſun, when
you ſee it? perhaps you may be in a dreame, and perhaps you, and all the men
in the world haue beene ſo, when they thought they were a wake, and then only
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, when they thought they dreamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="65">65. Anſwer: I aske, whether all points neceſſary to
be be believed, are ſo very evident in Scripture, that one cannot erre in the
meaning of them, but is no leſſe aſſured therof, then he is ſure he
ſees the Sun, when he ſees it; Or, they are not ſo evident? If they be
ſo evident, it followes clearly, that the meanes wherby they are immediatly
knowne (namely the very evidence of them) is ſuch, as no man can poſſibly
erre concerning them. For, it is impoſſible, that our vnderſtanding can
diſſent, from a truth, repreſented with evidence. And ſo you haue no
reaſon to blame <hi>Ch. Ma.,</hi> ſeing by the meanes wherby you
vnderſtand neceſſary Points of Faith in Scripture, it is impoſſible
for you to erre. If neceſſary Points be not ſo evident, but that one may
erre concerning them; Then you muſt vſe ſome meanes, for vnderſtanding
them, beſide the pretended evidence, which they haue of themſelves, which
indeed comes to be, not evidence, but obſcurity, if it leaue the
vnderſtanding, with a freedome to diſſent. Let therfore theſe meanes be
ſuch, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are wont to aſſigne; prayer, knowledge in
languages, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one place with another &amp;c. Which depending vpon
humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, cannot exceed probability, (as we haue heard Whitaker de
Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: <pb n="695" facs="tcp:59214:358"/>contr. 2. Queſt: 4. confeſſing) and cannot
aſſure vs of the true ſenſe of Scripture; which is againſt your
ſayings (N. 150.) That you <hi>haue certayne meanes of not erring in and
about the ſenſe of thoſe places, which are ſo plaine and cleare, that
they need no interpretation, and in ſuch we ſay our Faith is
contained.</hi> For, if to vnderſtand ſuch places you need the meanes and
helpe of Prayer, Language &amp;c: it is cleare, they are not ſo cleare, that
they need no interpretation. And ſo you muſt be content to acknowledge, in
theſe two numbers, a contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>diction to yourſelfe, and a cauſelesse blaming <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> in the former of them, if yourſelfe ſpeake Truth in the
latter; that is, you muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grant that one ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre in neceſſary
Points of Faith, or els that the Scripture is not evident, but needs an
interpreter of Scripture for ſuch Points; which if it need, ſeing the
meanes aſſigned by Proteſtants, can affoard no more than probability
only, which is not ſufficient to erect an act of divine Faith, it followes
that we muſt haue recourſe to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Living Guide. Thus I haue
confuted your objection againſt <hi>Charity Maintayned;</hi> That He
<hi>ſeemes to make no difference, between having certaine meanes to doe a
thing, and the Actuall doing of it.</hi> For, I haue told you, that when the
meanes to doe a thing, is ſeated in ſome cauſe, which hath not freedome
to the contrary Action, there is good reaſon, not to diſtinguiſh between
the enjoyning ſuch meanes, and the doing of the thing, or at leaſt not
doing the contrary, that is, in our caſe, not erring, againſt that which is
evident in Scripture: as whenſoever fire hath all requiſites, to burne a
combuſtible matter, it cannot but doe ſo. Now our vnderſtanding is of
that nature, that it cannot diſſent, from a truth evidently propoſed for
ſuch; and therfore if all texts of Scripture, containing neceſſary Points
of Faith, be evident (as you ſay they muſt be, and that otherwiſe they
could not be neceſſary) our vnderſtanding, cannot poſſibly
diſſent from them, and ſo not to erre, and not to be able to erre, proue
to be inſeparable: which holds particularly, in your doctrine that certainty
cannot conſiſt without evidence, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
cannot diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from any thing which is preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to it as certaine,
becauſe it cannot diſſent, or deny, that which to it is evident.</p>
               <p n="66">66. Your inſtances to the contrary, proue only, that
either you did not conſider, what you object; or argue an exceſſiue
confidence, that the world would, without examination, take for true,
whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you wrote. As if, ſay you, to <hi>Ch: Ma: you should
conclude,</hi> becauſe <hi>all men haue certaine meanes of ſalvation,</hi>
therfore all men muſt <hi>certainly <pb n="696" facs="tcp:59214:359"/>be ſaved and
cannot doe otherwiſe, as if whoſoever had ahorſe muſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly get
vp and ride: whoſoever had meanes to find out a way could not neglect thoſe
meanes and ſo miſtake it.</hi> But all theſe toyes are anſwered
already. For, the meanes to heaven, is, as our B. Saviour ſayes, to keepe the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, by our freewill, aſſiſted with Gods Grace, and therfore
it doth not follow, that, although we may, we muſt needs be ſaved,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our will may reſiſt Gods Grace; as alſo it is in your will not
to get vp and ride, though you haue a horſe: but it is not in the power of
our vnderſtanding, to diſſent from evident truth. Your ſimilitude of
fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a way, may be turned againſt you, if it be ſuppoſed, that one
hath the way before his eyes, and is certaine that it is the way. In which
caſe, he cannot miſtake his way, though by his freewill he may goe out of
it; as one may, with his will not obſerue what God commands, but cannot
poſſibly perſwade himſelfe that it is not commanded, if it be
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently repreſented to his vnderſtanding, that it is commanded: as one
cannot but be ſure, that he ſees the ſun, when he ſees it; which is
your owne example, to proue, that we may be aſſured that we do not erre:
But then you do not well to ſay, that our eye ſight may deceiue vs, or that
we may poſſibly erre; it being impoſſible, that our eye, and
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, being well diſpoſed, towards an object evident, can faile
to ſee, and vnderſtand actually, if ſuch an object, be placed within the
ſpheare, or compaſſe, of their actuity: And therfore, if Scripture be
evident whoſoever can aſſent to it, cannot poſſibly diſſent from
it. Before I end this number, you muſt be intreated to remember what you
teach (Pag; 329. N. 7.) that it is <hi>neceſſary to Faith, that the object
of it ſhould not be ſo evidently certaine, as to necesſitate our
vnderſtanding to an Aſſent, that ſo there might be ſome obedience in
it, which can hardly haue place where there is no posſibility of
diſobedience, as there is not where the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding does all, and the
will nothing.</hi> Now, if the vnderſtanding be not neceſſitated, by the
evidence of Faith, or contents of Scripture; you muſt find ſome other
meanes, to moue the vnderſtanding, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as Proteſtants vſually
preſcribe, which cannot exceede proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, nor is ſufficient for an Act
of Faith. And ſo your Arguments, and Similitudes, grounded vpon the plaine
evidence of Scripture, cannot be rightly applyed by you, ſeing it is not an
evidence, ſufficient to aſſure the vnderſtanding, without ſome other
meanes, which being but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, if you will arriue to certainty, you muſt
ſtill haue recourſe to the Church.</p>
               <pb n="697" facs="tcp:59214:359"/>
               <p n="67">67. Your (N. 151.) going vpon a falſe ſuppoſition,
that our firſt Proofes, and Arguments, for the infallibility of the Church,
are taken from Scripture, need no Anſwer, ſeing we haue proved the
contrary, at large. It is true, that having once found the true Church, and by
Her authority, Canonicall Scriptures, we do with good reaſon, proue out of
them the authority, and infallibility of the ſame Church; with other
particulars concerning her, which were not knowne by the firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
notion of her being the true Church; but this is done without any pretence, of
ſuch evidence as muſt force every mans vnderſtanding to aſſent, in
that manner as the Principles of naturall Sciences, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate vs; and
therfore, there alwayes remaines a neceſſity of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Judge.</p>
               <p n="68">68. In your (N. 154.) I find nothing, but an Aggregatum

And whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you take vpon you, yet <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> had reaſon to
ſay, that ſeing it is, to Proteſtants, a moſt neceſſary Point of
Faith, to know what Bookes be <pb n="698" facs="tcp:59214:360"/>Scripture, and that this
Point cannot be proved by Scripture; it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, that all matters of Faith,
are not contained in Scripture: wherby it appeares, that God hath not tyed his
teſtimony or Revelation, to his written word alone, but that you muſt of
neceſſity admitt Tradition, or His vnwritten Word, and ſo not learne all
neceſſary Points from Scripture. And if one Tradition muſt be believed by
Faith, you can bring no poſitiue Rule, or reaſon, why there may not be
ſome other Traditions, without any prejudice to the perfection of
Scripture.</p>

<q rend="margQuotes">If Dr. Potter anſwer, that their
Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, about the Scriptures being the only judge of Controverſyes is not a
Fundamentall Point of Faith; then as he teacheth, that the vniverſall Church
may erre in Points not Fundamentall, ſo I hope he will not deny, but
particular Churches and private men, are much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to errour in
ſuch Points; and in particular in this, that the Scripture alone is judge of
Controverſyes: And ſo the very Principle vpon which their whole Faith is
grounded, remaines to them vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; and on the other ſide, for the

Controverſyes.</q> Againſt which diſcourſe you object; <hi>A pretty
Sophiſme depending vpon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that whoſoever poſsibly may

particular Churches, nor private men are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble even in Fundamentalls,
that even the Fundamentalls of Chriſtianity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to you vncertaine? A
judge may poſsibly erre in judgment, can he therfore never haue aſſurance
that he hath judged right? A traveller may poſsibly miſtake his way, muſt
I therfore be doubtfull whether I am in the right way from my Hall to my
Chamber? Or can our London Carryer haue no certainty, in the middle of the day,
when he is ſober and in his wits, that he is in the way to London? Theſe,

in no caſe follow from hence, that abſolutly 
<q rend="margQuotes">whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may poſſibly erre, he
cannot be certaine, that he doth not erre: vnless you add this neceſſary
reſtriction; he cannot be certaine that he doth not erre,</q> as long as he
grounds himſelfe, only vpon that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which he believes to be
fallible, and ſubject to errour, though for other things, or vpon other
certaine and infallible Grounds, he may be, and is, ſure, that he neither
doth, nor can erre, while he relyes vpon thoſe infallible Grounds.</p>
               <p n="72">72. For better vnderſtanding of this matter: We may
diſtinguiſh a double infallibility. The one may be termed Perſonall, or
belonging to, or accompanying the Perſon: The other we may call Reall, or
taken from the thing itſelfe. If God promiſe his aſſiſtance to ſome
perſon, that he ſhall never erre, even in things of themſelves obſcure;
this man ſhall be ſure never to erre; not in vertue of any intrinſecall
evident Principle, but by reaſon of that Divine aſſiſtance. But if one
haue no ſuch promiſe, or Priviledge, yet is directed by ſome Principle,
evident to humane Reaſon, he is certaine, that he neither doth, nor can,
erre, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, derived from evidence of the Thing it ſelfe, as long
as he relyes vpon that certaine ground. Now to our purpoſe. You cannot be
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of this propoſition (Scripture alone is the totall Rule of Faith)
by evidence of ſenſe, or ſome Principle knowne to naturall Reaſon, but
only by certainty, proceeding from infallible ſupernaturall Aſſiſtance:
And therfore, ſeing you deny any ſuch Aſſiſtance to the vniverſall
Church, and much more to particular Churches, or private perſons, for Points
not Fundamentall (as you acknowledge this to be) it followes, that you can haue
no certainty of it; which is the thing that <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi>
affirmed: and ſo it proves to be very true, that whoſoever may erre, cannot
be certaine that he doth not erre, if he depend, vpon Grounds, ſubject to
falſhood, and errour; as contrarily, whoſoever doth not erre, becauſe he
relyes vpon evident Principles, or vpon ſome extrinſecall Authority, being
in it ſelfe, and being believed to be, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, he is ſure he cannot
erre in ſuch matters, though he may erre in other, knowne by ſome probable
reaſon, or fallible Authority. If you <pb n="700" facs="tcp:59214:361"/>ſay; A thing
may be certainly knowne, or believed, becauſe it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contained in
Scripture, which we belieue to be infallible. This evaſion anſwers not my
argument. For, if you imagine a thing to be ſo evident in Scripture, that
there is required no more than evidence of ſenſe, or Reaſon, to ſee,
and read, and know the Grammaticall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word; then
whoſoever does ſo, he is certaine, not only that he doth not, but that he
cannot erre, ſeing he is evidently certaine, that he ſees, reades, and
vnderſtands the Grammaticall ſignification of the word. If beſide the
ſayd knowledge, or ability to ſee, read &amp;c. there be other meanes
required (as certainly there are) to know what is (not the Grammaticall
ſignification, but) the meaning of the word, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Holy Ghoſt,
in that place; then if thoſe meanes be falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and only probable, no man
can, by the aſſiſtance of them alone, be certaine, that he doth not erre.
But if the meanes be, and be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be infallible, he is ſure, that he
neither doth, nor can erre, by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe meanes; and ſo to erre in a
way (in which one is certaine, that he doth not erre, and yet may erre, as long
as he retaines the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that Certainty, and followes them) is an
impoſſible thing. Thus your owne Objection turnes vpon yourſelfe, and
makes good the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Charity Maintayned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="73">73. But you vrge vs, and ſay: <hi>Vpon this Ground,
what will hinder me from concluding, that ſeing you alſo hold, that neither
particular Churches, nor private men are in fallible, even in Fundamentalls,
that even the Fundamentalls of Chriſtianity, remaine to you
vncertaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="74">74. Anſwer. Your inference were very good, if in the
beliefe of the Fundamentalls of Chriſtianity, we did rely vpon the Authority
of particular Churches, or private men. But we rely vpon the Authority of the
vniverſall Church, which is abſolutly infallible. Contrarily, for you, who
rely vpon no infallible Authority, of any Church, but vpon your owne fallible
diſcourſe, or the Scripture interpreted by fallible meanes, nothing, I am
ſure, can hinder vs from concluding, that even the Fundamentalls of
Chriſtianity remaine to you vncertaine. Still you are wounded with your owne
weapons. And to turne alſo againſt you your owne ſimilitudes: A Judge may
poſſibly erre in judgment, if he proceed only vpon probable reaſons, that
he Judges according to Law; neither can he haue aſſurance that he hath
judged right, if his ſentence be grounded vpon ſuch reaſons only. If in
ſome other caſe he haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that he hath judged right, it
muſt be grounded vpon certaine, <pb n="701" facs="tcp:59214:361"/>and evident reaſons,
which can never faile, nor he ever can fall into errour, by following ſuch
reaſons, or rules. Neither can your London Carryer, or any other, in the
middle of the day, when he is ſober and in his witts, miſtake the waie,
which he knowes with abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and evidence; as you aboue all
others muſt grant, who ſay, that we need no Guide for Controverſyes of
Faith, becauſe, as you pretend, you haue a cleare way, namely Scripture,
which therefore if you can miſtake, and know the meaning therof only
probably, you muſt confess the neceſſity of ſome Guide, to direct, and
keepe you in that way. Your owne caution (in the middle of the day) might haue
put you in mynd, that Faith is obſcure, and like a light in a darke place, as
S. Peter ſpeakes; which therfore is a way, which may not only be miſtaken,
but cannot be aſſuredly found, without the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome infallible
Guide. How many wayes, do your Arguments ſtrongly recoyle againſt
yourſelfe, without the leaſt hurt to your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary! Even your vaine
concluſion <hi>(theſe you ſee are right worthy conſequences, and yet
they are as like your owne as an egg to an egge, or milke to milke)</hi> muſt

               <p n="75">75. By what I haue ſayd, your (N. 161.) is fully

Scripture is the totall Rule of Faith, the truth, or falſhood wherof, muſt
be tryed by ſome other meanes, and you can haue none certaine, if you take
away the infallibility of Gods Church. And I wonder you can ſay, concerning
theſe words of <hi>Charity Maintayn.</hi> (for the ſelfe ſame reaſon
Proteſtants are not certaine that the Church is not Judge of

truth, or falſhood, but of a Propoſition, the truth or falſhood wherof,
cannot be knowne, by ſenſe, or naturall Reaſon, but only by Revelation,
in which if the vniverſall Church may erre, for Points <pb n="702" facs="tcp:59214:362"/>not Fundamentall, we cannot poſſibly haue certainty of the truth
of them, as I haue proved; and it is intolerable in you to make this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
we may be certaine that ſnow is not blacke, nor fire cold; therfore we may be
certaine of truths, which can be knowne only by Revelation, for Points in which
you ſay the whole Church of Chriſt, and much more private men, may
erre.</p>
               <p n="76">76. To your (N. 162.) I need only ſay, that a publike
and vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Authority to decide Controverſyes of Faith, and interpret
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures muſt be infallible; otherwiſe it might either be diſobeyed,
or els men would be forced to obey exteriourly, that which they judge in
Conſcience to be a damnable Errour, as hertofore I haue declared, and
ſhewed a large difference betweene a Judge in Civill cauſes, and
Controverſyes in matters of Faith, alledging to that purpoſe, your owne
words (Pag: 59. N. 17.) That <hi>in Matters of Religion, ſuch a Iudge is
required, whom we ſhould be obliged to belieue, to haue judged right. So that
in Civill Controverſyes, every honeſt vnderſtanding man is fitt to be a
Iudge; but in Religion, none but he that is infallible.</hi> And yet ſo farre
you forget yourſelf as to object to vs in this (N. 162.) <hi>I hope you will
not deny, but that the Iudges haue Authority to determine criminall and Civill
Controverſyes; and yet I hope you will not ſay, that they are abſolutely
infallible in their determinations. Infallble while they proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to
Law.</hi> How then can you diſtinguiſh betwene a Judge in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and a
Judge, in Controverſyes of Religion, vnless you grant not only a
conditionall, but an abſolute infallibility to this latter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby he is
ſure never to erre, whereas a Judg in Civill matters may erre, by not
proceeding according to Law? If therfore the Propoſitions, which were
publikly defended in Oxford, (that the Church hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to determine
Controverſyes in Faith, and to interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) be patient of your
Explication, I can only ſay, that they either ſay nothing, or teach men to
diſſemble in matters of Faith, by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commandements of the Church,
againſt their Conſcience. I haue read your friend Irenaeus Philalethes
(Diſſertatione de Pace Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae) who teaches, that no man ought now,
after the tyme of the Apoſtles, who were infallible, to be puniſhed by
Excommunication, as long as he followes the dictamen of his Conſcience; and
how do you tell vs, that now one may be excommunicated for an errour in Faith?
Though you admit no infallible Judge, to declare the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and that thoſe Texts which ſeeme evident to ſome, appeare ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure 
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:59214:362"/>to others, as is manifeſt, in the examples which you
alledge as evident, of our Saviours Paſſion, and Reſurection, which
diverſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes haue either denyed, or vnderſtood in a different way
from the doctrine of Gods Church; and yourſelfe in particular, belieue that
his ſuffering, and Death, was not the Death and Paſſion of God; and that
his Sufferings did not merit, and ſatiſfy for mankind; and that he remaines
in Heaven, with a Body of a different nature, and Eſſence, from that which
he had vpon Earth; which is to deny his Reſurrection, for ſubſtance, and
Death, for the fruite therof. You ſay; <hi>The Doctor</hi> (who defended the
ſaied Concluſions <hi>together with the Article of the Church of England,
attributeth to the Church, nay to particular Churches, and I ſubſcribe to
his opinion, an Authority of determining Controverſyes of Faith, according to
plain and evident Scripture and vniverſall Tradition, and infallibility while
they proceed according to this Rule.</hi> But how doth this agree, with the
whole Scope of your Booke, <hi>that the Bible, the Bible, the Bible, is the
only Rule;</hi> and with your express words heere, (N. 155.) that <hi>no
vnwritten Doctrine hath atteſtatten from Tradition tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vniverſall?</hi>
Seing, beſide Scripture, you grant a Tradition, which you ſay gives an
infallibility, to him who proceeds according to it: Which ſhewes that there
is ſome infallible vnwritten word, or Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You ſay: <hi>But what now
if I ſhould tell you, that in the yeare</hi> 1632. <hi>among publike
Concluſions defended in Doway, one was, that, God prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminates men to All
their Actions.</hi> I anſwer: That, if you will inferr any thing from hence,
it muſt only be this; that, as the Queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Predetermination is not
defined by the Church, but left to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in Schooles, with an express
command of our Supreme Paſtour, that one part do not cenſure another; ſo
if you grant, that, out of the ſayd Propoſitions defended in Oxford, I may
inferr, that the <hi>Scripture alone is not the Rule of Faith,</hi> or at
leaſt, that you are not certaine it is ſo, nor can condemne vs Catholikes
for holding the contrary; if, I ſay, you grant this, you overthrow that
Ground, in which alone, all Proteſtants pretend to agree, and of which if
they be not abſolutly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the whole ſtructure of their Faith muſt
be ruinous. You over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſh in ſuppoſing, we ſay, that the Church cannot
erre, <hi>whether ſhe vſe meanes or no.</hi> But we are ſure, that as the
Holy Ghoſt promiſed Her the End, of not erring, ſo alſo he will not
faile, to moue Her eſſectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to vſe ſuch meanes, as ſhall be
needfull for that End. Your (N. 163.) about a place of S. Auſtine, I haue

               <pb n="704" facs="tcp:59214:363"/>
               <p n="77">77. In your (N. 164.) you ſay: <hi>Why may not the
Roman Church be content to be a Part of that viſible Church which was extant
when Luther began, and the Grecian another? And if one muſt be the whole, why
not the Greeke Church as well as Roman? There being not one Note of your
Church, which agrees not to Her as well as to your owne,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="78">78. Anſwer. If you ſpeake of the true Church of
Chriſt in Greece, ſhe is ſo farr from being divided from the Roman, that
ſhe doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree with, but ſubmitts to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Her, and receives from
her, Prieſts or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in Rome it ſelfe, and brought vp in Catholique
Countries. The Sciſmaticall Grecians, to their diviſion from the Roman
Church, haue added Hereſy, as even Proteſtants confeſſe, and ſo are
neither the whole Church, nor any Church, at all; it being indeed, no leſſe
than a kind of blaſphemy, to affirme, that, Conventicles of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, can
be the true Church of Chriſt Dr: Lawde (Pag: 24.) ſaith of the Errour of
the Grecians; <hi>I know and acknowledge, that Errour of denying the
Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Son, to be a grievous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in
Divinity.</hi> And, (Pag: 154.) <hi>I would faine know, what Article of the
Faith doth more concerne all Chriſtians in generall, than that of
Filioque?</hi> Which Errour of the Grecians, hath beene condemned by three
Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councells, in which the Grecians were preſent, and to which they
gaue conſent; namely, the Councell of Lateran vnder Innoc: 3. Anno 1215. The
Councell of Lyons vnder Gregory the 10. Anno 1273. The Councell of Florence
Anno 1438. And you muſt conſider, that the Grecians hold Generall
Councells, to be Rules of Faith. Of this matter, Brierly (Tract: 1. Sect: 7.
Subdiv: 2. Marg: 11. Pag: 202.) ſpeakes very well, and ſhewes, even out of
Proteſtant Writers, the beginning of the Errours of the Grecians, and their
defections from the Roman Church, and in particular ſaith, that, <hi>twelue
tymes, or therabout, hath the Greeke Church reconciled itſelfe to Rome, and
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fallen from thence, being the rupon now at laſt wholly

the beliefe of all things revealed by God: Therfore they agree in all matters

ſhould inculpably deny a thing revealed by God, and ſo diſagree from
other Catholikes, that therfore our Faith were changed, becauſe all do not
agree in thoſe Objects, in which they may chance inculpably to diſagree.
You define the Religion of Proteſtants to be the Bible, and that all who
belieue all plaine Texts therof, are true Proteſtants, and do agree in
matters of Faith, and therfore muſt agree among themſelves in ſuch
Points. Now I aske, whether you will <hi>define matters of Faith to be thoſe
wherin Proteſtants agree?</hi> If you ſay, yes; then I take your owne
words, and ſay; this is ridiculous, and as if we ſhould ſay,
<hi>Proteſtants agree in thoſe things wherin they agree.</hi> If you
anſwer, No; but that matters of Faith, are thoſe which are clearly
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, whether or no, Proteſtants, or any other belieue
them; then you both anſwer, and confute your owne Objection, and turne it
againſt yourſelfe. You ſay, it is ridiculous to ſay, we agree in
matters of Faith, and are <hi>all agreed that only thoſe things wherin we
agree are matters of Faith;</hi> And yet you ſay, <hi>Proteſtants if they
were wiſe, would do ſo too:</hi> which is to ſay, Proteſtants if they
were wiſe, would do that which you ſay is ridiculous. Nay according to this
your wholſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, if they will be wiſe, they muſt not regard, what
indeed is matter of Faith (as being revealed by God) but only, that they
procure to agree among themſelves, and then ſay, that they agree in matters
of Faith; which <hi>is to ſay, they agree in thoſe things wherin they do
agree:</hi> which is the thing you object againſt vs. Nevertheleſſe, I
know not well by what Logike you will inferr, that we ſpeake, as if one would
ſay, we agree in thoſe things wherin we agree; vnless perhaps, by ſome
ſuch wild Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme as this: All matters of Faith are thoſe wherin we
agree; but we agree in all matters of Faith; Therfore we agree in all thoſe
things wherin we agree: as if you ſay; every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a reaſonable creature
but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſonable creature is a man; Therfore every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If you
would to the purpoſe, you might ſay; whatſoever we agree in, is a matter
of Faith; but we agree in the belief of the Trinity &amp;c. Therfore the
beliefe of the Trinity &amp;c. is a matter of Faith. But howſoever this be;
we vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny that definition of Faith, and leaue it to Proteſtants, that
they may be wiſe according to the wiſdom of your adviſe, and
definition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the reſt of this (N. 5.) as alſo to your (N. 6.)
I anſwer, that <pb n="709" facs="tcp:59214:369"/>you would gladly divert vs to particular
diſputes: But it is ſufficient to ſay in generall, That whatſoever is
knowne to be propoſed by the Church, as revealed by God, is a Point of Faith
in reſpect of him, to whom it is ſo propoſed. Neither it is pertinent to
this preſent Worke; to diſpute in what ſubject infallibility reſides.
Let me now tell you, that which may ſuffice for the preſent, that, thoſe
three meanes of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which you mention, (the Pope; A Councell with him;
The vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church) haue never yet, nor ever ſhall, nor ever can be
found, to diſagree. And it is no fayre dealing in you, to omitt, what <hi>Ch:
ma:</hi> hath concerning this matter (Part: 2. Chapt: 5. N. 15. and 16.) where
he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers the objection, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d diſcovers the falſifications of Potter, in
citing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Authors, about this point. But to proue that the
vniverſall Church cannot be infallible, or a meanes of agreement, you ſay
(N. 6.) <hi>And indeed what way of ending Controverſyes can this be, when
either part, may pretend, that they are part of the Church, and they receiue
not the decree, therfore the whole Church hath not received it.</hi> Anſwer.
I know no man hath greater obligation, to anſwer your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, than
yourſelfe; who teach, that by vniverſall Tradition, we know Scripture to be
the word of God. For, if one ſhould ſay, what way of determining, what
Scripture is the Word of God, can this be, when if any deny it, they may
pretend, that they are part of the Church, and they receiue not ſuch, or
ſuch Scriptures, therfore the whole Church (or vniverſall Tradition) hath
not received them. If you anſwer, that the number, or Authority, of a few is
not conſiderable in compariſon, or oppoſition to all the reſt, nor
ought to prevaile againſt the contrary ſuffrages, as you ſpeake (Pag: 68.
N. 43.) I anſwer; Firſt, that if the Church be fallible, it is not the
number, but the waight of reaſon, which ought to prevaile. And ſecondly;
you cannot but ſee, how eaſy it is for vs, to ſay the ſame; That, it
imports not, if ſome, who are not of conſideration, in reſpect of all the
reſt, diſagree from them. But the truth is, your Objection is of no force,
vnless you helpe it out with your wonted refuge of begging the Queſtion, and
ſuppoſing, the Church not to be infallible. For, if ſhe be infallible,
whoſoever oppoſe Her decrees, and Definitions, by doing ſo, become
Heretikes, and ceaſe to be members of the Church, nor can prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that they
are part of the Church and they receiue not the decree: Therfore the whole
Church hath not received it: As I ſayd aboue, that Schiſmatiques cannot
pretend to be members of the Church, after their ſeparation. And this your
ſubtility <pb n="710" facs="tcp:59214:370"/>is directly againſt Dr. Potter (Pag: 57.)
ſaying. <hi>Whoſoever either wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſes any Catholique Verity
maintayned by this Church (or the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que viſible Church) as doe
Heretikes, or perverſly drvides himſelfe from the Catholique Communion, is
doe Schiſmatikes: the condition of both is damnable. The Scriptures and
Fathers cited here by the Miſtaker, proue this, and no more: and therfore
prone nothing againſt Proteſtants, who never denyed it.</hi> Now why do you
not aske your client, Potter? How any man can oppoſe the whole Church, or
depart from Her Communion, ſeing they who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and depart, may pretend,
that they are part of the Church, and do not oppoſe, or depart from
themſelves: and therfore Proteſtants, who the Doctour ſaith, never denyed
it, muſt deny it, if they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue you; or you muſt deny yourſelfe,
if you will belieue them. Your (N. 7.8.) are meere words without any proofe,
and deſerue no other Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your whole (N. 9.) is plainly impertinent, <hi>Charity
Maintayned,</hi> (Part: 1. Chap: 3. N. 1.) declared, how Proteſtants are wont
to abuſe the diſtinction of Points Fundamentall, and not Fundamentall, to
many purpoſes of theirs; and among the reſt, to this: 
<q rend="margQuotes">That, if you object their bitter and
cotinued diſcords in matters of Faith, without any meanes of agreement, they
inſtantly tell you, they differ in points not Fundamentall.</q> In which
words, it is cleare, that <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> intends only to ſhew, what vſe
Proteſtants make of the ſayd diſtinction; and that he ſpeakes truth,
you neither do, nor can deny, the thing being notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But you decline the
matter, and ſay; <hi>I deſire you to tell me, whether they do ſo, or doe
not ſo,</hi> (that is whether they differ in points only not Fundamentall, or
do nor differ in them) <hi>If they doe ſo, I hope you will not find fault
with the Anſwer.</hi> But your hope in this, is perſumption. For, although
it were granted, (which yet is very falſe) that they differ only in Points
not Fundamentall; yet I haue reaſon to find fault with the anſwer,
becauſe they giue it, to ſhew that notwitſtanding their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement in
Points not Fundamentall, yet they are Brethren, and may all be in ſtate of
ſalvation; which to affirme, is both very falſe, and very pernicious:
ſeing that errour in any Point revealed by God, and ſufficiently propoſed
for ſuch, is damnable, and excludes ſalvation, even according to your owne
doctrine; and therfore this Anſwer doth not free them, from what <hi>Charity
maintayned</hi> objected, that they abuſe this diſtinction: and to this you
ſhould haue anſwered, without decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, by impertinent diverſions,
and demands. The other part of your <pb n="711" facs="tcp:59214:370"/>Dilemma is this:
<hi>If you ſay they do not ſo,</hi> (that is, differ, not only in not
Fundamentalls) <hi>but in Points Fundamentall alſo; then they are not members
of the ſame Church one with another, no more than with you: And therfore why
ſhould you object to any of them, their differences from each other, any more
then to yourſelves, their more and greater differences from you?</hi> Thus
you; ſtill flying a direct anſwerto <hi>Ch. Ma.,</hi> and yet granting
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force all that he deſires. If, ſay you, Proteſtants differ in Points
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, <hi>then they are not members of the ſame Church one with
another:</hi> And then, ſay I, they perniciouſly abuſe people, with this
diſtinction, to perſwade them the direct contrary of that, which even
yourſelfe here inferr: to perſwade men, I ſay, that they are members of
the ſame Church, and capable of ſalvation, and Brethren, though according
to your ſuppoſition in this part of your Dilemma, they differ in Points
Fundamentall. And this is that to which you ſhould haue anſwered, whether
they do not abuſe this diſtinction, and either haue acquitted, them, or
done <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> Right by an open confeſſion of his ſaying truly,
They abuſe this diſtinction. You ſay, <hi>If Proteſtants differ in
Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, they are not members of the ſame Church one with another, no
more than with</hi> vs Catholikes. If this beſo; the more vnreaſonable,
incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, and vnjuſt are they, in pretending to be Brethren one to
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet enemyes to vs: wherby you do ſtill more and more make good,
that they abuſe this diſtinction, in pretending to be Brethren one to
another, and not to vs; eſpecially if we call to mynd, that many of their
chiefeſt learned men, in diverſe moſt important matters, agree with
vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt other Proteſtants, and yet they muſt be Brethren, and we
enemyes, even in thoſe very Points in which they agree with vs againſt
other Proteſtants; which is very prodigious.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Your laſt words, either paſſe my vnderſtanding,
or elſe are no better than ridiculous. You ſay to vs: <hi>Why ſhould you
object to any of them, their differences from each other, any more than to
yourſelves, their more and greater differences from you?</hi> For my part, I
can draw no better Argument from theſe words than this: we object to
Proteſtants, who pretend to be Brethren of the ſame Church, ſubſtance
of Faith, and hope of ſalvation, that they differ in Fundamentall Points of
Faith (for, as I ſayd, you ſpeake expreſſly of ſuch Points, in this
ſecond Part of your Dilemma) therfore we may as well object to ourſelves,
their more and greater diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, I ſay, who daily
proclaime to the world, that neither they, nor any other Heretikes are our
Brethren, or of the ſame Faith, <pb n="712" facs="tcp:59214:371"/>Church, and hope of
ſalvation. How can we object to ourſelves a thing wherin we proceede with
moſt evident conſequence, and Truth? If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we did pretend to be their
Brethren, then we might, and ought to object againſt ourſelves, the great
differences between them, and vs; as now with reaſon we make ſuch an
objection againſt them. But our caſe being directly contrary to theirs, we
are obliged to proceed in a contrary way, and to profeſſe, that there can
be no communication, of light with darkeness, of falſhood with truth, of
Hereſy with Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique doctrine.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You ſay in your (N. 10.) <hi>What els do we
vnderſtand by an vnfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall errour, but ſuch a one with which a man
may posſibly be ſaved?</hi> I aske, whether he may be ſaved with
Repentance, or without it? If only with Repentance, you make no difference
between Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and vnfundamentall Points; becauſe with repentance any
errour may be forgiven, be it never ſo Fundamentall. If you meane, a man may
be ſaved with ſuch an errour, even without repentance, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
yourſelfe, who perpetually affirme, that, errours not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall are
damnable in themſelves, and cannot be pardoned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance. And I
haue proved it to be impoſſible, that any culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errour can be forgiven
without relinquiſhing it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To yuur (N. 11.12, 13.14.) I haue anſwered in
ſeverall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Only for your (N. 11.) it muſt be remembred, that I
haue proved Communion in Liturgie, Sacraments &amp;c: to be eſſentiall to
the Viſible Church; which makes your ſimilitude of renouncing the vices of
a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, and yet not renouncing a friend, to be impertinent; becauſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are not eſſentiall to a friend, as externall Communion is eſſentiall to
the Church; which therfore muſt needs be forſaken, when one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from
that which is eſſentiall to her.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Your (N. 15.16.17.) containe no other difficulty,
except that which yourſelfe create out of nothing, while you faine, this
roving ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and then impute it to <hi>Cha: Ma: Whoſoever disbelieues
any thing knowen by himſelfe to be revealed by God, imputes falſhood to God
and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore errs Fundamentally. But ſome Proteſtants disbelieue things;
which other belieue to be teſtifyed by God; therfore they impute falſhood
to God, and erre Fundamentally.</hi> But why do you ſeeke to deceiue the
ignorant, with ſuch Sophiſmes, as theſe? Doth not <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> ſpeake expreſſly of the caſe wherin, there is
Queſtion between two contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning ſome Point,
which God hath revealed? And therfore one of the litigants, muſt really erre
againſt Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <pb n="713" facs="tcp:59214:371"/>on, and be a formall
Heretike, if ignorance chance not to excuſe him; which though perhaps ſome
will conceiue, may happen in one or two or a few, yet to belieue, that whole
congregations, and Churches, ſhould be excuſed by invincible ignorance-,
notwithſtanding all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of knowledg, that God failes not to affoard, can
be neither diſcree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Charity, nor charitable diſcretion, but a dangerous,
and pernicious occaſion, and incitement, to ſloath, and neglect of
ſeeking the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, vpon confidence of finding a lawfull excuſe, by
ignorance. You ſay (Pag: 21.) <hi>If any Proteſtant or Papiſt be betrayed
into, or kept in any Errour, by any ſin of his will (as it is to be feared
many millions are) ſuch Errour is as the cauſe of it, ſinfull and
damnable.</hi> And (Pag: 19. and 20.) you deny not, but that the far greater
part of Proteſtants, faile in vſing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient diligence to find the
truth, and that their errours are damnable; therfore <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> might
well ſay, not only that, per ſe loquendo, of two diſſenting in matters
revealed by God, one muſt oppoſe his divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and Veracity
(which is evidently true) but alſo, that de fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is ſo in many
millions, yea in the far greater part of Proteſtants, who therfore erre
culpably againſt the divine Teſtimony, and committ a deadly ſin, not
becauſe others, as you ſpeak, belieue a thing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God (which
<hi>Ch. ma.</hi> never ſayd, nor dreamed) but becauſe they themſelves
ought to haue believed, that ſame thing to be revealed, which others did
belieue to be ſuch, and indeed was ſuch. Thus then you ought to reforme
your diſtracted Syllogiſme: Whoſoever disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves any thing knowne, and
which ought to be knowne, by himſelfe, to be revealed by God, imputes
falſhood to God, and therfore errs fundamentally: But ſome Proteſtants
(you ſay millions, yea the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part) disbelieue thoſe things, which
others belieue to be teſtifyed by God, and which are, and ought to be knowne
by themſelves to be ſo teſtifyed; Therfere ſome Proteſtants (yea
millions, and the greater part of them) impute falſhood to God, and erre
Fundamentally.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But yet, that it may further appeare, how much you
wrong <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> I muſt ſet downe his words, which, (Chap:
3. N. 3.) are theſe: 
<q rend="margQuotes">The difference among Proteſtants
conſiſts not in this, that ſome belieue ſome Points of which others are
ignorant, or not bound expreſſly to know (as the diſtinction ought to be
applyed) but that ſome of them disbelieue, and directly, wittingly, and
willingly oppoſe what others belieue to be teſtifyed by the word of God,
wherin there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Points Fundamentall and not
Fundamentall: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <pb n="714" facs="tcp:59214:372"/>till Points Fundamentall be
ſufficiently propoſed, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God, it is not againſt Faith to
reject them, or rather without ſufficient propoſition it is not
poſſible prudently to belieue them: And the like is of Points not
fundamentall, which as ſoone as they come to be ſufficiently propounded as
divine Truths, they can no more be denyed, than Points Fundamentall propounded
after the ſame manner.</q> What could be ſayd more clearly, to ſhew, that
<hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> ſpoke not of whatſoever kind of Objects, but expreſſly
of ſuch, as are really teſtifyed by God, and not only believed to be ſuch
by others, but alſo ſufficiently propoſed to a mans ſelfe as Divine
Truths, and which therfore bring with them, a moſt ſtrict obligation to be
believed? Your little reſpect to truth, hath forced me to be longer in this
point, than I expected, or deſired to be. And I hope it appeares, that you
had no other cauſe, except want of Charity to <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> to
<hi>feare that his hart condemned him of a great calumny, and egregious
ſophiſtry, in imputing Fundamentall and damnable errour to diſagreeing
Proteſtants; becauſe forſooth, ſome of them disbelieue, and wittingly
oppoſe, what others do belieue to be teſtifyed by the word of God:</hi>
Seing <hi>Cha: Ma: expresſly required, that what others</hi> believed to be
teſtifyed by God, ſhould alſo be ſufficiently propoſed to ones
ſelfe, before he could be obliged to belieue; which ſufficient
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition being ſuppoſed, yourſelfe do not deny, but it is a
damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to disbelieue any ſuch truth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Your (N. 18.) hath two good propertyes, Falſhood;
and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, or Obſcurity. You cite <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> ſpeaking thus:
<hi>The difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Proteſtants conſiſts not in this, that ſome
belieue ſome Points of which others are ignorant, or not bound expressly to
know,</hi> and there you ſtop; but <hi>Charity maintayned</hi> added theſe
words: <hi>but that ſome of them disbelieue, and directly, and wittingly, and
willingly oppoſe, what others do belieue to be teſtifyed by the word of
God, wherin there is no difference between Points Fundamentall, and not
Fundamentall &amp;c:</hi> Now I pray, is there not a maine difference, between
ignorance, or a not knowing, or Neſcience of a thing which another believes,
and a poſitiue oppoſition, or actuall beliefe of the contrary to that which
another believes? How many truths are there which men do not know, and yet erre
not againſt them, be cauſe their very ignorance keepes them from any
judgement concerning them, by way of Affirmation or negation; but they carry
themſelves privatively, or in a certaine manner paſſively, or
abſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely, as if there were no ſuch objects?</p>
               <pb n="715" facs="tcp:59214:372"/>
               <p n="11">11. But let vs heare what you object againſt ſo
manifeſt a truth. You ſay, <hi>I would gladly know, whether you ſpeake of
Proteſtants differing in profesſion only, or in opinion alſo.</hi>
Anſwer. I vnderſtand not well what you meane, by differing in
profeſſion only, or in opinion alſo. Do you meane, that they make
profeſſion of differing in opinion, when indeed they do not differ? This
were to diſſemble, and ly in matters of Religion. But whatſoever your
meaning be; I anſwer, that <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> ſpoke expressly of
Proteſtants, differing in opinion, one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing what another believes,
as you confeſſe out of His words: But you are willing to raiſe
difficultyes, where otherwiſe none could appeare.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But then, you ſay, <hi>If they differ in opinion,
then ſure they are ignorant of the truth of each others opinions: It being
imposſible and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious, that a man ſhould know one thing to be
true, and belieue the contrary, or know it and not belieue it. And if they do
not know the Truth of each others opinions, then, I hope, you will grant they
are ignorant of it. If your meaning were, they were not ignorant, that each
other held; theſe opinions, or of the ſenſe of the opinions which they
held; I anſwer, this is nothing to the convincing of their vnderſtandings
of the truth of them, and theſe remaining vnconvinced of the truth of them,
they are excuſable if they do not belieue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Anſwer. Though it be much againſt my inclination,
yet truth commands me to ſay, that here you ſhew, either great ignorance,
or elſe write directly againſt your owne knowledge, where you will needs
confound, pure ignorance, with poſitiue Errour; the difference of which I
ſhewed even now: and what Logician is ignorant, of the diviſion of
ignorance into Ignorantiam purae privation is, and Ignorantiam pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vae
diſpoſition is: that is, a meere want of knowledge of ſome truth, or a
poſitiue errour contrary to it? And by your leaue, your ſaying [<hi>If they
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in opinion, they are ignorant of the truth of each others
opinions</hi>] is ſo far from being true (ſpeaking of pure ignorance) that
it implyes contradiction to ſay, He who errs, is ignorant; ſeing to be
purely ignorant, in the ſayd diviſion of ignorance, is one member into
which, ignorance is divided; and one membrum dividens cannot in good Logicke
include the other, and therfore errour cannot include pure ignorance: For it
were to ſay, one hath no knowledge at all, and yet hath a falſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
or, a privation is a poſitiue entity, and a Nothing a Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Your
objection, He who errs, knowes not the contrary Truth, <pb n="716" facs="tcp:59214:373"/>and if he knowe not the truth, he is ignorant of it, is a meere
miſtake, or equivocation. For, that he who errs knowes not, or is ignorant of
the contrary, by a pure ignorance or Neſcience, I deny: That he is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
by a poſitiue errour, or ignorance prauae diſpoſitionis, I grant: and
ſo, when you aſſume, He who knowes not the truth, is ignorant of it, you
muſt diſtinguiſh according to the double ſenſe of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which
hath beene declared, and not ſpeake with ſuch confuſion. This ſame
diſtinction I find in Dr. Potter (Pag: 243.) where ſpeaking of ſome
Fundamentall Articles of Faith, he hath theſe words: <hi>Theſe are ſo
abſolutly neceſſary to all Chriſtians, for attaining the end of our
Faith, that is, the ſalvation of our ſoules; that a Chriſtian may looſe
himſelfe, not only by a poſitiue erring in them, or denying of them; but by
a pure ignorance, or neſcience, or not knowing of them.</hi> Where you ſee,
he diſtinguiſhes between error, and not knowing: and therfore one may be
ignorant of what another believes, and yet not erre againſt it, or disbelieue
it: As it is one thing, not to be hot, and another to be hold. Now Charity
Maintayned expressly diſtinguiſhes between pure ignorance, and errour; and
therfore you do very ill, firſt to confound them, and then vpon that affected
miſtake frame your Objections. The ſame equivocation you haue (Pag: 25.)
where you make a ſhewe of great ſubtility, but indeed the Reader will finde
nothing but vanity, as I ſhewed in that place.</p>
               <p n="14">14. You ſay to <hi>Charity Maintayned (If your meaning
were, they were not ignorant, that each other held theſe opinions, or of the
ſenſe of the opinions which they held</hi> &amp;c:) I anſwer, that this
ſaying of yours is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. For, though de facto
Proteſtants are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, what opinion other Proteſtants hold, and
therfore their diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement is more patent, and not only againſt the
opinions by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they might chance to be held, but alſo againſt
opinions knowne to be defended by them whom they will needs call Brethren: Yet
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is meerly accidentall, and in no wiſe neceſſary to our
preſent purpoſe, that one Proteſtant ſhould be conſcious, or know
that he differs in opinion from another. For, if it were revealed to ſome in
the Indyes, that Chriſt is God, and Saviour of the world, and he did
aſſent to that truth, while another in Europe, did diſſent from the
like Revelation ſufficiently propoſed, this ſecond doth truly disbelieue,
what the former believes, no leſſe than if he had knowne, that the other
believes it; And therfore <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſaid; Proteſtants 
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:59214:373"/>
                  <hi>disbelieue, and wittixgly and willingly oppoſe what
others do belieué to be teſtifyed by the word of God,</hi> without
ſaying vnneceſſarily, that they disbelieue, what they know others
belieue, becauſe, as I ſayd, this knowledge is not neceſſary for our
preſent purpoſe, concerning the diſagreement of Proteſtants, in matters
of Faith. Much leſſe to the purpoſe, yea directly againſt ſyncerity,
is your ſaying; That if <hi>their vnderſtandings be not convinced, they are
excuſable if they do not belieue.</hi> Seing <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> did
ſpeake of objects ſufficiently propoſed as revealed by God; which are his
expreſſe words, in this very number, which you impugne.</p>
               <p n="15">15. In your (N. 19.20.21.23.) nothing occurrs of
difficulty, which hath not beene anſwered elſwhere: And you falſify
<hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> when (N. 20.) you ſay <hi>he concludes that there is
nodifference betweene errours in</hi> Points Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, and not
Fundamentall; wheras he expreſſly ſaith in his (N. 3.) (which here you
anſwer) and (N. 4.) that they do not differ in this, that both of them are
<hi>againſt Gods Revelation, and damnable,</hi> (which yourſelfe often
grant) yet you know, that in other reſpects, he puts a maine difference
betweene them, even in the number next precedent, and declares the matter at
large. Surely this is no good dealing!</p>
               <p n="16">16. In your (N. 22.) you ſtill voluntarily miſtake
the ſtate of the Queſtion; though <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> had ſtated
it very clearly (N. 3.) as we haue ſeene; i. e. that when we treate, whether
errour excludes ſalvation, we ſpeake of Points ſufficiently propoſed as
revealed by God, and not in caſe of invincible ignorance, want of
inſtruction, or the like. This being preſuppoſed, <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> (N. 4.) ſaith thus; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Dr: Potter forgetting to what purpoſe
Proteſtants make vſe of their diſtinction, doth ſinally overthrow it,
and yields as much as we can deſire. Speakinge (Pag: 211.) of that meaſure
and quantity of Faith, without which, none can be ſaved, he ſaith: It is
enough to belieue ſome things by a virtuall Faith, or by a generall, and as
it were a negatiue Faith, wherby they are not denyed, or contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now,
our queſtion is, in caſe that divine truth, although not Fundamentall, be
denyed and contradicted; and therfore, even according to Him, all ſuch
denyall excludes ſalvation.</q> Thus <hi>Charity Maintayned;</hi> whoſe
words you cite very imperfectly in this manner: <hi>It is enough (by Dr:
Potters confesſion) to belieue ſome things negatively: i.e. not to deny
them; therfore all denyall of any divine Truth excludes <pb n="718" facs="tcp:59214:374"/>ſalvation.</hi> Thus ſay you; omitting theſe very next words of
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> 
                  <q rend="margQuotes">[now our queſtion is, in caſe that
divine Truths, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not Fundamentall, be denyed and contradicted: And
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore even according to Him, all ſuch denyall excludes ſalvation.]</q>
And that Dr: Potter alwayes ſuppoſes a ſufficient Propoſition, before
one can be obliged, not to deny, or contradict thoſe Points of which he
ſpeakes, is evident; becauſe one could not be obliged vnder ſin, not to
contradict them, if they be not ſufficiently propoſed: Which Propoſition
he requires Univerſally, in matters of Faith. And in this very place he
ſaith; <hi>There is a certaine meaſure and quantity of Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which
none can be ſaved; but every thing revealed belongs not to this
meaſure.</hi> And then he adds the a foreſayd words; <hi>It is enough to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue ſome things by a virtuall Faith, or by a negatiue Faith, wherby they
are not denyed.</hi> Where it appeares, that, as no man is obliged to belieue
thoſe Fundamentall Points, without the beliefe wherof, <hi>none can be
ſaved,</hi> vnless they be ſufficiently propoſed; ſo none can be
obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not to contradict Points not Fundamentall, if they want ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Propoſall. And this is yet further demonſtrated by <hi>Charity
Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned,</hi> who immediatly after the words of which you take notice, and
cite as His (though imperfectly) ſaith thus; <hi>After He</hi> (Dr: Potter)
<hi>ſpeakes more plainly,</hi> (in the very next Pag: 212.) <hi>It is true
whatſoever is revealed in Scripture, or propounded by the Church out of
Scripture, is in ſome ſenſe, Fundamentall, in regard of the divine
Authority of God, and his word, by which it is recommended; that is, ſuch as
may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed or contradicted without infidelity; ſuch as every
Chriſtian is bound with humility, and reverence, to belieue whenſoever the
knowledge therof is offered to him:</hi> (marke, <hi>whenſoever the knowledg
therof is offered to him.</hi>) And further, Pag: 250. he ſaith; <hi>where
the revealed will or word of God is ſufficiently propounded,</hi> (obſerue,
<hi>ſufficiently propounded) there he that oppoſeth, is convinced of
errour, and he who is thus conuinced, is an Heretike, and Hereſy is a worke
of the fleſh, which excludeth from heauen</hi> (Galat: 5.20.21.) <hi>And
hence it followeth, that it is Fundamentall to a Chriſtians Faith, and
neceſſary for his ſalvation, that he belieue all truths of God, wherof he
may be convinced that they are from God.</hi> Marke, <hi>convinced that they
are from God,</hi> which implyes a ſufficient propoſall. Now with what
conſcience could you conceale all theſe cleare words of Potter, which by
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> are ſet downe immediatly after thoſe which you
cite out of Him <hi>(Charity Maintaryned)</hi> and impugne them? 
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:59214:374"/>Yea the Doctor (Pag: 213.) in the very ſame threed of
diſcourſe which <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> alledged out of his (Pag: 211.)
of which you take notice, and endeavour to defend, ſaith; <hi>Fundamentall
properly is that which Chriſtians are obliged to belieue by an expreſſe
and actuall Faith. In other Points, that Faith which the Cardinall Perron calls
the Faith of adherency, or non-repugnance, may ſuffice; to witt, an humble
preparation of mynd to belieue all, or any thing revealed in Scripture when it
is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cleared.</hi> You ſee theſe words are in effect the very
ſame, which you anſwer [<hi>it is enough by Dr: Potters confeſſing to
belieue ſome things negatively</hi> &amp;c:] and that He expreſſly
requires, that a thing be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently cleared, before one can be obliged to
a non-repugnance, or a non-denyall of it. Which doctrine of Potter being once
ſuppoſed, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is a good Argument. It is enough for ſalvation,
not to deny ſome things, when they ſhall be ſufficiently propounded as
revealed by God: Therfore the denyall of them, when they are ſo propoſed,
is not enough for ſalvation, but excludes it. Can you poſſibly haue any
thing to object againſt ſo manifeſt a deduction, and truth, as this
is?</p>
               <p n="17">17. You ſay, (N. 22.) it is <hi>As if you ſhould
ſay: One horſe is enough for a man to goe a journey: Therfore without a
Horſe no man can goe a journey: As if ſome divine truths, viz: Thoſe
which are plainly revealed, might not be ſuch, as of neceſſity were not
to be denyed: And others for want of ſufficient declaration, denyable without
danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. Anſwer. You could not, even for a fee, haue pleaded
more effectually, in fauour of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> than now you doe,
while your intention is to impugne Him. You grant that truths ſufficiently
declared, are ſuch as of neceſſity are not to be denyed. But both Dr:
Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in the words of which we treat,
expreſſly ſpeake of truths ſufficienty declared, as I haue proved;
therfore, even by your owne confeſſion, they cannot be denyed; which is the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of <hi>Charity Maintayned.</hi> I confeſſe my ſelfe to find
great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how to frame any anſwer to your example of a Horſe;
becauſe I cannot penetrate, what vſe, or application you intended, or could
make of it. Only I wiſh you to conſider, that when Dr: Potter ſaith, it
is enough to belieue ſome things, by, as it were, a negatiue Faith, wherby
they are not denyed, ſo that one haue an humble preparation of mynd to
belieue them, when they are ſufficiently cleared, that they are revealed, (as
we haue heard him ſpeake) he ſuppoſes, that it is neceſſary to
ſalvation to haue ſuch a preparation of mynd: And then 
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:59214:375"/>your ſimilitude muſt goe thus: A horſe is
neceſſary for a man to goe a journey; therfore without a horſe no man can
goe a journey; and ſo we may ſay; it is neceſſary (and not only
ſufficient) for ſalvation, in preparation of mynd not to reject, any Point
ſufficiently propounded, as teſtifyed by God: Therfore, whoſoever is not
ſo prepared, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des himſelfe from ſalvation; which is that we would
haue. Or els thus: <hi>A horſe is enough for a man to goe a journey,</hi> not
abſolutly, but vpon condition, that he be not lame, or extremely weake, or
otherwiſe vnable, to travell. Therfore, if a horſe be lame, or otherwiſe
vnable, he is not enough for a man to goe a journey; which conſequence will
teach vs to make this inference; it is enough for ſalvation, that one belieue
ſome things with an implicite Faith, not abſolutly, but vpon condition,
that he be ready to imbrace, and belieue them actually, and explicitly, when
they ſhall be ſufficiently propounded in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: Therfore an implicite
Faith, is not ſufficient for ſalvation, if he want ſuch a readiness of
mynd; which is our Concluſion. Never the leſſe, if your Faith be ſo
ſtrong, that you will needs haue one horſe (though lame, and loaden with as
many diſeaſes as a horſe) to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or ſufficient, though not
neceſſary, for a man to goe a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and for that cauſe, that this is
no good conſequence, <hi>One horſe is enough for a man to goe a journey,
therfore without a horſe no man can goe a journey;</hi> you know, that not
only Catholikes, but Potter; your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and all Proteſtants, (as we haue
heard you affirme hertofore) and all Chriſtians, muſt deny the parity; it
being moſt certaine, and evident, that the beliefe of all Points
Fundamentall, is not enough for ſalvation, but is of itſelfe, (taken alone)
as it were lame, and too weake without a mynd ready not to contradict,
whatſoever is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently propounded as witneſſed by God, which is
abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation; and therefore we muſt ſtill
conclude, that all denyall of any Divine Truth, ſufficiently propounded,
excludes ſalvation, though one be ſuppoſed to belieue all Points which
are Fundamentall of their owne nature. Theſe are the beſt conſiderations,
that I can draw from your example of a horſe, which yet you ſee, make
ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for vs, againſt yourſelfe.</p>
               <p n="14">14. You are pleaſed (N. 24.) to ſumme vp, or, as you
ſpeake, <hi>bring out of the cloudes,</hi> the diſcourſe of <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> in his (Chap: 3. N. 5.) and then you cenſure it thus:
<hi>Which is truly a very proper and convenient Argument
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Anſwer. You are ſo far from bringing <hi>out of
the cloudes,</hi> the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> that you
haue caſt over it a cloude, and darkneſſe, which neither you, nor any
body els, will be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue from it, and place it in its owne former
light, except by hearing his owne words, which are theſe. 
<q rend="margQuotes">I will therfore conclude with this
Argument. According to all Philoſophy and Divinity, the Unity and
diſtinction of every thing followeth the nature and eſſence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and
therfore if the nature, and being of Faith be not taken from the matter which a
man believes, but from the motiue for which he believes (which is Gods Word or
Revelation) we muſt likewiſe affirme, that the Unity and Diverſity of
Faith, muſt be meaſured by Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation (which is a like for all
Objects) and not by the ſmalness, or greatness of the matter which we
belieue. Now that the nature of Faith is not taken chiefly from the greatness,
or ſmalness of the things believed, is manifeſt, becauſe otherwiſe one
who believes only Fundamentall Points, and an other who together with them,
doth alſo belieue Points not Fundamentall, ſhould haue Faith of (formall)
different natures; yea there ſhould be as many (formall) differences of
Faith, as there are different Points which men belieue, according to different
capacities, or inſtruction &amp;c: And therfore we muſt ſay, that vnity
in Faith doth not depend vpon Points Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, but vpon Gods Revelation,
equally, or vnequally, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: And Proteſtants pretending an vnity only
by reaſon of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in Fundamentall Points, do indeed induce as
great a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Faith, as there is multitude of different objects,
which are believed by them; and ſince they diſagree in things equally
revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God, it is evident, that they forſake the very formall motiue of
Faith, which is Gods Revelation, and conſequently looſe all Faith, and
vnity therein.</q> In which words we ſee <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi>
ſpeakes of that vnity of Faith, which is taken from the Formall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and
which to oppoſe, is the proper cauſe of damnation, for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perſons,
in all Objects, whether they be great, or ſmall, like, or vnlike, of
themſelves.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Now in this diſcourſe, what falſe
Propoſitions, what confuſion can you finde? You ſay: <hi>Who knowes not
that the Eſſence of all Habits (and therfore of Faith among the reſt) is
taken from their Act, and their <pb n="722" facs="tcp:59214:376"/>Object? If the Habit be
generall, from the Act and Object in generall; if the Habit beſpecall, from
the Act and Object inſpeciall. Then for the motiue to a thing, that it cannot
be of the eſſence of the thing to which is moves, who can doubt, that
knowes that a motiue is an efficient cauſe; and the efficient is alwaies
extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall to the effect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. Anſwer: To what purpoſe talk you of the
Eſſence of Habits, ſeing the Diſcourſe of <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> concerned
only the Act of Faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby we belieue ſome Truths, becauſe they are
revealed by God, and vpon this ground he proved, that every contrary Act is
damnable, and a grievous ſinne, which cannot be verifyed of Habits, which of
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not ſinnes? Now, who can deny, that an Act of Faith takes
its nature, Eſſence, and ſpecification (as Philoſophers ſpeak) from
the Divine Revelation? And I hope you will not tell vs that the Eſſence of
all Acts, is taken from their Act, and their Object, as if the Eſſence of
the Act were derived from the Act. Dr: Potter (Pag: 139.) ſaith
expreſſly; <hi>The formall Object or reaſon of Faith, the chiefe
Motiue,</hi> (mark, motiue) <hi>the firſt and fartheſt Principle into which
it reſolves, is only divine Revelation.</hi> Obſerue, that Divine
Revelation only, is the firſt and laſt, into which Faith reſolves,
without mentioning that it is taken from the Act, yea excluding it by the word
only <hi>(only Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)</hi> And (Pag: 143.) he ſaieth: <hi>The
chiefe Principle and ground on which Faith reſts, and for which it firmely
aſſents vnto thoſe truths, which the Church propounds is divine
Revelation made in Scripture. Nothing less then this, nothing but this can
erect or qualify an Act of ſupernaturall Faith, which muſt be abſotutely
vndoubted and certaine, and without this, Faith is but opinion or
perſwaſion, or at the moſt, acquired humane beleef.</hi> Which words not
only declare, the Eſſence of Divine Faith, but alſo express, how by that
Eſſence, it is diſtinguiſhed from other things, and in particular from
humane Faith, perſwaſion, and opinion, as <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> ſaied, the
vnity and diſtinction of every thing followeth, the Nature and Eſſence
therof. Thus you ſee, that <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> ſpoke truth, in affirming,
that the Nature and Being of Faith, is taken from the Motiue for which a man
believes; and that Potter vſeth the word Motiue directly in this ſenſe,
and to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="23">23. What doe you meane in ſaying; <hi>If the habit be
generall, the eſsence is taken from the Act and Object in generall; If the
Habit be ſpeciall, from the Act and Obiect in ſpeciall?</hi> I am very
ſure, that every Habit, and Act, exiſts in particular, though their Obiects

               <p n="24">24. <hi>Cha. Ma.</hi> and Dr. Potter ſaied, that our
motiue to belieue, is the Divine Revelation, and, which is more, you affirme
the ſame heere, That <hi>Gods Revelation is an equall Motiue to induce vs to
belieue all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects revealed by him:</hi> And yet you ſtrangely object:
<hi>That the Motiue to a thing cannot be of the eſſence of the thing to
which it moves, who can doubt, that knowes that a motiue is an efficient
cauſe, and the efficient is alwaies extrinſecall to the effect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. Anſwer; Firſt, The motiue, or Formall Object, of
which we ſpeak, is not an efficient cauſe, in reſpect of the Habit, or
Act of Faith; but, if you will reduce it, to one of the foure kinds of
Cauſes, which are commonly aſſigned, ſome will ſaie it is Cauſa
formalis extrinſeca: and perhaps others will ſay, that you belieue <hi>the
motiue to a thing to be</hi> an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe, becauſe Ariſtotle
defines the efficient cauſe, to be Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium motus, and you confound motum
and motivum; or motion, and motiue. Secondly; Though a motiue were an efficient
Cauſe, your Argument <hi>(That it cannot be of the eſsence of the thing to
which it moves, becauſe the efficient cauſe is is alwayes extrinſecall to
the effect)</hi> is of no moment. For no man ever dreamed, that the motiue, or
formall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, is of the intrinſecall eſſence of the act
therof, as Genus and Differentia are intrinſecall to the Species, or Materia
and Forma are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall Compoſito phyſico, but that the act, takes
its eſſence from the formall Motiue or object, and eſſentially is, or
includes, a Refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to it, as every creature eſſentially hath a Relation
to God, who is the Prime and ſupreme efficient cauſe of all things, and
conſequently, as you ſay, extrinſecall to them. For this cauſe <hi>C:
Ma:</hi> ſaied not, that the Motiue to belieue is the eſſence of Faith;
but that the eſſence or nature of Faith is taken from the Motiue for which
a man believes; Which words ſignify a difference, not an identity, ſeing a
thing is not ſaied to take from itſelf, (but to be) its owne Eſſence.
Do not yourſelfe ſay, that the Eſſence of all Habits is taken from
their Act and from their Object? And yet I ſuppoſe, you will not grant,
that the Act and Object are of the Eſſence of Habits, as intrinſecall to
them: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeing naturall Habits, are eſſiciently produced by
Acts, and Acts by Habits (even ſupernaturall Acts) as by their efficient
cauſes: And therfore according to your words, are always extrinſecall to
the effect. And ſo you anſwer, and confute your owne ſelfe.</p>
               <pb n="724" facs="tcp:59214:377"/>
               <p n="26">26. You doubt what <hi>Cha: ma:</hi> did meane by theſe
words (Gods Revelation is alike for all Objects.) But his meaning is cleare;
that Gods Revelation is the ſame, whether it be applyed, to Points
Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, or not Fundamentall, and can no more be disbelieved, in one kind
of theſe Objects, than in another, it being no leſſe impoſſible, that
the Supreme Verity, and Veracity, can teſtify a falſhood, in a ſmall,
than in a great matter; as your ſelfe here affirme expreſſly, that Gods
Revelation is an equall Motiue, to induce vs to belieue all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects revealed
by him. But you ſay; this ſenſe is impertinent; which you muſt giue me
leaue to deny. For, if it be alike damnable, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Gods teſtimony,
whether the matter be in itſelfe, great or ſmall; it followes, that
whoſoever diſſents, from the leaſt Point, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propounded to
be revealed by God, ſins damnably, and is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſalvation,
without repentance; ſo that of two diſſenting in an Object knowne to be a
divine truth, one of them cannot be ſaved, without repentance. And it is
ſtrang, that ſtill you will be altering the ſtate of the Queſtion,
notwithſtanding, that <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> expreſſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that we
ſpeake of perſons, to whom the Divine Revelation, is ſufficiently
propounded for ſuch. Where now are the falſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the
diſorder of forme, the inconſequence of the Concluſion, which you ſo
contemptuouſly objected to <hi>Cha: ma:?</hi> But chiefly, where ſhall we
find in all theſe your diverſions, and tergiverſations, a direct
Anſwer, to the diſcourſe of <hi>Cha: ma:,</hi> that the Eſſence, and
vnity, or diuerſity of Faith is chiefly to be attended, in order to the
Formall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is Divine Revelation, and not in reſpect of the
matter, of Fundamentall, or not Fundamentall Points; and conſequently, that
it is impoſſible, that when two diſagree in matters ſufficiently
decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them to be divine truths, both can be ſaved. Your (N. 25.) hath
beene anſwered at large hertofore.</p>
               <p n="27">27. For the anſwer which in your (N. 26,) you giue to
the (N. 9.10.11.) of <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> if the Reader will take the paines, to
peruſe thoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> he will find, that there is a
great difference, to take things from the Originall itſelfe, and to receaue
them from a Coppy, drawne by a partiall hand, of an vnſincere Adverſary.
<hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> proves the Church Catholique to be vniverſally infallible,
becauſe otherwiſe, ſhe might either propoſe things contrary to divine
Revelation, or els propoſe for a revealed Truth, that which is not ſuch,
which were a damnable ſin, and Dr. Potter confeſſes that the Church
cannot erre damnably.</p>
               <pb n="725" facs="tcp:59214:377"/>
               <p n="28">28. To this you anſwer, that the Church may do theſe
things by <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or miſtake, and ſo without damnable ſin.</hi>
But this anſwer is confuted by what hath beene ſayd hertofore. For, if it
be evident in Scripture, that the Church may erre in ſome Points, ſhe
cannot but know, that ſhe expoſes Herſelfe to danger, of errour againſt
the divine Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and conſequently ſins damnable, vnless ſhe hath
evident Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for what ſhe propoſes; which cannot happen when ſhe
propoſes a falſhood. If it be not evident in Scripture, that ſhe may erre
in ſome Points, then you, who take Scripture for the ſole Rule of Faith,
cannot be ſure, that ſhe may erre; eſpecially if we reflect, that,
Scripture aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res vs (as Proteſtants grant) that ſhe is Infallible in
ſome (namely in Fundamentall) Points, and doth not tell vs what thoſe
Points in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular be. Beſides, you teach (Pag: 277. N. 61.) that there is
promiſed to the Church, not only an aſſiſtance not to erre in things
abſolutely neceſſary, but <hi>a farther aſsiſtance is conditionally
promiſed, even ſuch an Aſsiſtance as ſhall lead vs, if we be not
wanting to it and ourſelves, into all, not only neceſſary, but very
profitable truth, and guarde vs from all, not only deſtructiue, but alſo
hurtfull errours.</hi> And therfore to <hi>Char: Maint.</hi> ſaying, that a
Church not erring in Fundamentalls, doth as much <hi>as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our exacts at
her hands; as much</hi> as lyes in her power to doe; you anſwer <hi>This is
manifeſtly vntrue. For, Gods aſsiſtance is alwayes ready to promote Her
farther. It is ready, I ſay, but on condition the Church does implore it: on
condit on that when it is offered in the Divine directions of Scripture and
reaſon, the Church be not negligent to follow it.</hi> Which words do not
well agree with your anſwer, that, the Church may erre <hi>by Ignorance or
Miſtake and ſo without damnable ſin;</hi> ſeing on the one ſide,
every errour againſt Divine Revelation, is of itſelfe a damnable ſin, and
on the other, the Church wants not ſufficient aſſiſtance not to erre,
and in fact ſhall be ſure not to erre if <hi>ſhe be not negligent to
follow Gods Asſiſtance when it is offered in the divine directions of
Scriptuae and reaſon;</hi> and therfore her Errours muſt needs be culpable,
as proceeding only from her owne neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. In this very (N. 26.) which I
confute, yourſelfe aſſirme, that ſhe <hi>cannot be excuſed from
headlong and pernicious temerity in propoſing Points not Fundamentall, to be
believed by Chriſtians, as matters of Faith,</hi> if it be <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of ſuch vnfundamentall Points, as ſhe is not warranted to propoſe by
euident Text of Scripture. Indeed if ſhe propoſe ſuch, as matters of
Faith certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, ſhe may well be queſtioned, quo warranto? She builds
without a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſays, Thus ſaith the Lord, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the Lord doth not ſay ſo:
which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <pb n="726" facs="tcp:59214:378"/>be excuſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> raſhneſſe and high
preſumption. But though ſhe may erre in ſome pointe not Fundamentall, yet
may ſhe haue certainty enough in propoſing others, evidently and vndeniably
ſet downe in Scripture, and conſequently, may be without all
raſhneſſe propoſed by the Church, as certaine divine revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi>
Theſe be your words, which clearly overthrow, your owne Anſwer. For, I
argue thus: If the Church proceed vpon evident Scripture, ſhe cannot erre in
thoſe things. If not; ſhe always expoſes herſelfe to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of errour,
for the matter (which may proue falſe) and to certaine actuall errour, for
the manner, by propoſing as a Point of Faith certainly true, which yet is
always vncertaine, if ſhe in ſuch things may be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as you ſay
ſhe may, whenſoever ſhe is not warranted by evident Text of Scripture.
Thus by your owne grounds, the Church is either certaine, that ſhe errs not,
as relying vpon evident Scripture; or if ſhe haue not ſuch evidence, ſhe
is certaine, that ſhe expoſes herſelfe, and others, to errour againſt
Divine Revelation, which cannot be excuſed from a great ſin of
raſhneſſe and high preſumption. And then, when will your excuſe of
ignorance, or miſtake, haue place, which cannot happen when ſhe hath
evidence of Scripture, and will not excuſe, when ſhe wants ſuch evidence?
And ſo there is no meane, betweene certainty, that ſhe errs not; and
committing a ſin, by expoſinge Herſelfe, to a knowne danger of errour
againſt the Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p n="29">29. By the way; I would know, how your Doctrine, 
<q rend="margQuotes">(That God hath promiſed to the Church ſuch an
aſſiſtance as ſhall lead vs into all not only neceſſary, but very
proſitable truth, if we be not wanting to it)</q> agree, with what you ſay,
in your Anſwer to the Direction (N. 32.) <hi>It is not abſolutely
neceſſary, that God ſhould aſsiſt his Church any farther then to
bring her to ſalvation?</hi> Is it not neceſſary that God keepe his
promiſe? And how do you find fault with <hi>Cha. Ma.</hi> for ſaying, that
if the Church be infallible only in Fundamentall Points, if ſhe erre not in
ſuch Points, ſhe performes as much as our Saviour exacts at her hands,
ſeing he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts no more than that, which may bring her to ſalvation, and
it is not neceſſary that God aſſiſt her for more than ſalvation? Or
if he abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely exact more than is neceſſary; men are bound to doe more
than is neceſſary, and ſo more ſhall be neceſſary, than is
neceſſary; becauſe it is neceſſary to doe what we are bound to
doe.</p>
               <p n="30">30. You ſay to <hi>Ch. Ma; The ground of your errour
here, is your not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, betweene Actuall certainty, and
Abſolute infallibility.</hi> But in this, you ſpeake either againſt your
owne conſcience, or againſt manifeſt truth. <pb n="727" facs="tcp:59214:378"/>For if
you ſay, the meaning of <hi>Cha. ma.</hi> to be, that whoſoever is
actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally certaine of one thing, muſt haue an abſolute infallibility in all
other matters, your Conſcience cannot but tell you, that He could haue no
ſuch meaning, as if, becauſe I am actually certaine, what I am doing at
this inſtant, I muſt therfore be infallible, and know certainly, what
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one is doing in the Indyes. But if you meane, that it is an errour in
<hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> to ſay, that if one haue actuall certainty of a thing, he
muſt be infallible both in that, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all other, for which he hath the ſame,
or like grounds, to make him certaine; then you erre againſt manifeſt
truth, it being evident, that if I clearly ſee my ſelfe to haue an
vndoubted Ground, to belieue a thing, it is impoſſible, that I ſhould
erre in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for which I alſo evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſee, that I haue the ſame
certaine ground. This is our caſe. If I be actually certaine, by evidence of
Scripture, of the truth of one thing, I am certaine, that I cannot erre in any
other Point, for which I haue the like evidence of Scripture; as he, who
actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſſents to a demonſtration, knowne to be ſuch, can neither
erre in it, nor in any other, knowne to haue the like certainty. This being
ſuppoſed, your examples proue againſt yourſelfe, as I ſhewed in an
other like occaſion.</p>
               <p n="31">31. I haue already particularly and at large, anſwered
your (N. 27.28.29.) In your (N. 30 33.34.) you impugne <hi>Ch: Ma.</hi> whoſe
words I wiſh you had ſet downe, as you found them in Him, and not as you
collect and offer them to the Reader; whom therfore I muſt intreate, to
peruſe the Author himſelfe. <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> (N. 13.) ſaith, That, to
limite the generall promiſes of our Saviour for his Church, to Points
Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, as namely, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that the gates of Hell ſhall not
prevaile againſt Her, and that the Holy Ghoſt ſhall lead them into all
truth &amp;c.</q> is to deſtroy all Faith. For, by this manner of
interpreting, and limiting words, whatſoever is delivered in Scripture,
concerning the infallibility of the Apoſtles, or of Scripture it ſelfe, may
be reſtrained, to infallibility in Fundamentall Points. And in this, <hi>Ch.
Ma.</hi> hath reaſon. For, ſeing you haue no certaine Rule of Faith, but
Scripture; whatſoever you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proue by evident Scripture, cannot be to
you, certaine, or a Point of Faith. Let vs then take theſe words (Matth.
16.18.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">The gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile
&amp;c.</q> Which our B. Saviour pronounced of the Church, and thoſe other,
(Jo: 16. V. 13.14.16.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">The ſpirit ſhall lead you into all
truth, and ſhall abide with you for ever,</q> which promiſe, Potter ſaith
(Pag: 153.) <hi>was made directly and primarily to the Apoſtles 
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:59214:379"/>(who had the ſpirits guidance in a more high and
abſolute manner, than any ſince them) yet it was made to them for the
behoofe of the Church, and is verifyed in the Church vniverſall.</hi> The
firſt words, The gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt Her, Potter
(Pag. 153.) limites they ſhall <hi>not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile ſo far, as to ſever it
from the foundation;</hi> that is, that She ſhall not erre in Fundamentall
Points. Now, I beſeech you, produce ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Text of Scripture,
declaring, that thoſe words are not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as they ſound,
that the Church ſhall be ſecure from all errours againſt Faith, even in
Points not Fundamentall, (which errours are gates that leade to hell; ſeing
they are, as you often confeſſe, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in themſelves, and ſo lead
to hell and damnation) but with this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, that ſhe ſhall be
ſecured for Points Fundamentall. Produce, I ſay, ſome ſuch evident Text
of Scripture, and not topicall diſcourſes of your owne. In the meane tyme,
while you are buſy about that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible taske, (of producing ſome
ſuch Text)</p>
               <p n="32">32. I will ponder the ſecond place. <hi>The ſpirit
ſhall lead you into all truth, and ſhall abide with you for ever;</hi>
which, Potter ſaith, is vnderſtood of the Apoſtles, and of the
vniverſall Church; but ſo, as being referred to the Apoſtles, it
ſignifyes all truths, Fundamentall, and not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Points; which is a
harder explanation, than that of the former words out of S. Matthew: 
<q rend="margQuotes">The gates of hell &amp;c.</q> becauſe you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, to
alledge ſome evident Text of Scripture, to proue that the very ſelfſame,
as I may ſaie, indiviſible Text, which is acknowledged to ſpeake, both of
the Apoſtles, and of the Church, muſt be forced, and as it were racked, to
ſpeake one thing of the Apoſtles, and another of the Church: All truth, for
the Apoſtles; not all, but only Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, truth, for the Church. Bring,
I ſay, ſome ſuch evident Text of Scripture. But, it ſeemes, you did
eaſily perceiue, that no ſuch place could be pretended: and therfore in
ſtead of Scripture, or the Word of God, you offer only your owne conceits,
diſcourſes, and ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruences, which are far beneath that
certainty, which is required for an act of divine Faith. <hi>There is not,</hi>
ſay you (N. 30.) <hi>the ſame reaſon for the Churches abſolute
Infallibility, as for the Apoſtles and Scriptures. For, if the Church fall
into errour it may be reformed by comparing it with the Rule of the Apoſtles
doctrine, and Scripture. But if the Apoſtles erred in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the
Doctrine of Chriſtianity to whom ſhall we haue recourſe, for the
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering and correcting their errour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="33">33. Anſwer. I haue often ſayd, that in matters,
knowne by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <pb n="729" facs="tcp:59214:379"/>only, and depending on the free
will, or decree of Almighty God, we are not to proue, by humane reaſon, what
he hath decreed. Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants grant, that, both the Apoſtles, and the Church,
are infallible for Fundamentall Points. If then, one ſhould make vſe of
your reaſon, and ſay: (There is not the ſame reaſon for the Churches
infallibility in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Points, as for the Apoſtles. For, if the
Church fall into ſuch errours, it may be reformed by comparing it with the
Rule of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles doctrine, and Scripture. But, if the Apoſtles haue
erred in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the doctrine of Chriſtianity, to whom ſhall we haue
recourſe, for the diſcovering and correcting their errour?) What would you
anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer? Would you grant, that the Church is not infallible in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Articles, becauſe there is not the ſame reaſon for Her infallibility in
Fundamentall Points, as there is for the Apoſtles? That were to deny the
common Doctrine of Proteſtants, and the ſuppoſition. If you anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
that though there were not the ſelfe ſame reaſon, or neceſſity, for
the Churches infallibility, as for the Apoſtles (which is all that that
reaſon proves, and ſo is a Sophiſme a dicto ſecundum quid, ad dictum
ſimpliciter, as if you ſhould ſay; This Truth is not proved by this
particu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar reaſon, therefore there can be no reaſon for it) yet we cannot
doubt, but that there is ſome reaſon and cauſe, whatſoever it be, and
therfore you muſt be content, that Scripture declare God Almightyes Will,
that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt the Church; in which
Promiſe, ſeing there is no reſtraint to Fundamentall Points, it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
not you, to divide the ſame ſentence, into different meanings, as they are
applyed to the Apoſtles, and as they haue reference to the Church. Beſide,
if one would imitate you, in determining concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning divine matters, according
to humane apprehenſion, and diſcourſe, he might, in your owne Grounds,
quickly diſpatch all, and ſay; that ſeing the errours of the vniverſall
Church, can be only not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, there is no neceſſity, of having
recourſe to any, for the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and correcting them; and ſo you
cannot inferr, that the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les for reforming errours in the Church, need
be infallible in Points not Fundamentall, no more than you ſay the Church
herſelfe is. Thus (Pag: 35. N. 7,) You ſay, <hi>Chriſtians haue, and
ſhall haue meanes ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to determine, not all Controverſyes, but
all neceſſary to be determined:</hi> And what Rule, will you, in your
Groundes, giue to determine, what Points are neceſſary to be determined?
except by ſaying, that eo ipſo that they are not Fundamentall, or not
neceſſary to ſalvation to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, <pb n="730" facs="tcp:59214:380"/>they are
not neceſſary to be determined, as you ſay in the ſame place; <hi>If
ſome Controverſyes may for many Ages be vndetermined, and yet in the meane
while men may be ſaved, why ſhould, or how can the Churches being
furniſhed with effectuall meanes to determine all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes in
Religion, be neceſſary to ſalvation, the end itſelfe, to which theſe
meanes are ordained, being, as Experience ſhewes, not neceſſary?</hi> If
then, (may we ſay) the beliefe of vnfundamentall Points, be not neceſſary
to ſalvation (which is the end of our Faith) the meanes to beget ſuch a
Faith in the Church, which you ſay muſt be the vniverſall infallibility
of the Apoſtles, cannot be neceſſary. Which is confirmed by what you
ſay in your Anſwer to the Direction, (N. 32.) <hi>It is not abſolutely
neceſſary, that God ſhould aſſiſt his Church any farther than to
bring her to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> How then can it be neceſſary, in your
ground, that the Church be aſſiſted for Points not Fundamentall? Thus,
while by your humane diſcourſes, you will eſtabliſh the vniverſall
infallibility, of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, you deſtroy it, as not being
neceſſary, for diſcovering, or correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, either Fundamentall errours,
from which the Church is free, or vnfundamentall, which are not neceſſary,
to be corrected, or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Morover, this very reaſon of yours, proves
a neceſſity of the Churches being vniverſally infallible, ſuppoſing
the truth which we proved (Chap: 2.) that, Scripture alone containes not
evidently, and particularly, all Points neceſſary to be believed; and that
even for thoſe which it containes, a Living Judge and Interpreter is
neceſſary. For, this truth ſuppoſed, I apply your Argument, thus: If
any fall into errour by a falſe interpretation of Scripture, it may be
diſcovered, and corrected by the Church. But if the Church may erre, to whom
ſhall we haue recourſe, for correcting her errour? And heere, incidently, I
put you in minde, of the Argument which you prize ſo much, as to glory, that
you never could finde any Catholik, who was able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it; that if a
particular man, or Church, may fall into errour, and yet remaine a member of
the Church vniverſall, why may not the Church vniverſall erre, and yet
remaine a true Church? The Anſwer, I ſay, is eaſy, almoſt out of your
owne words, that there is not the ſame reaſon, for every particular mans or
Churches, infallibility, or ſecurity from error, as for that of the Catholik
Church. For, if private perſons, or Churches, fall into errour, it may be
reformed by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with the Decrees and Definitions of the vniverſall
Church. But if the Church may erre, to whom ſhall we haue recourſe to
correct her <pb n="731" facs="tcp:59214:380"/>error? As S. Hierom: ſaieth (Lib: 1.

               <p n="34">34. You ſay in the ſame: (N. 30.) <hi>There is not

Prophets, and Canonicall Writers, are the Foundation of the Church, according
to that of S. Paul, built vpon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets;
therfore their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, in reaſon ought to be greater than the Churches
which is built v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="35">35. Anſwer. Your concluſion (therfore their
ſtability in reaſon ought &amp;c:) ſhewes that you ground yourſelfe on
reaſon, not on revelation; and on a reaſon, which is not ſo much as
probable. For, you will not deny but that God might haue communicated
abſolute infallibility, both to the Apoſtles, and to the Church; yet to the
Church dependently of the preaching of the Apoſtles; and then, what would you
haue ſayd to your owne ground, In reaſon more ſtrength is required in the
Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, than in the Edifice, ſeing in that caſe, both the Foundation
and Edifice, ſhould haue had an immoveable, and firme ſtrength, and
ſtability? Your reaſon (if you will haue it proue any thing againſt vs)
muſt goe vpon this principle; that nothing which depends, or which is
builded, vpon another for its certainty, can be abſolutely certaine; which is
a ground evidently falſe. The Concluſion in a demonſtratiue Argument, is
abfolutly certaine, and yet depends on Premiſes. The Church is infallible in
Fundamentalls; and yet in that infallibility, is builded vpon the Foundation of
the Apoſtles, and Prophets. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute infallibility of the Apoſtles,
was builded vpon our B. Saviours Words, and even his infallibility, as man, was
builded vpon the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility <pb n="732" facs="tcp:59214:381"/>of his God head; and yet
I hope you will not ſay, that the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and our B. Saviour, were not
abſolutely infallible, becauſe they were built vpon another higher
infallibility. And I returne your owne words againſt you, <hi>if but wiſe
men</hi> (or even men in their wits) <hi>haue the ordering of the building,
they will make</hi> it as ſure <hi>a thing that the building ſhall not fall
from the Foundation, as that the Foundation ſhall not faile the
building,</hi> if it be in their power to doe both theſe things, with as much
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and facility, as to doe one of them. And no wonder; ſeing the
ſtability of the Foundation is but a Meanes to the End, that the Edifice
which is builded vpon it, be ſtable, and every wiſe man hath greater regard
to the End then to the Meanes, in reſpect of which, the End may be called,
the Foundation vpon which depends the Election of the Meanes; and in vaine it
is, that the Foundation cannot faile the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if the building may fall
from the Foundation, And if, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to build high, were a meanes to make
the building not fall from the Foundation, as digging deepe, makes the
Foundation not faile the building, men would be as carefull, to build high, as
now they make ſure to digg low for better ſetling the Foundation, and every
one would ayme at a tower of Babel. Now the Apoſtles received of the Holy
Ghoſt infallibility, not for themſelves alone, but for the good of the
Church, and it is no less eaſy, for God, to beſtowe abſolute
infallibility, vpon the Church, than vpon the Apoſtles; vpon the Edifice,
than vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Foundation; and therfore no wonder if the Church partake of the
ſame ſtability, and infallibility with Her Foundation, for the
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not for the manner, that is, as the Apoſtles were, ſo the
Church is free, from all errour, but ſo, as the Church received Her Doctrine
from the Apoſtles, and not the Apoſtles from the Church. You find fault
with <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> who making right vſe of this metaphore,
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that as a Foundation alone, is not a houſe, ſo to belieue
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, or the Foundation alone, is not ſufficient to conſtitute a
Church, or houſe of God, without the beliefe of all Points ſufficiently
propounded, as revealed by God: and now yourſelfe ground a matter of
greateſt moment, (the infallibility of the Church) vpon the ſame
meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore, very ill applyed, towards any other purpoſe, except to proue, the
contradictory of that, for which you alledge it, and to confute your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
as even now I haue demonſtrated. And beſides all this; ſeing, in your
Doctrine, we belieue the Scriptures, and the Doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, or
that there were any ſuch men as the Apoſtles, for the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty 
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:59214:381"/>of the Church, or vniverſall Tradition; the Church, to
you is the Foundation of your beliefe, that the Apoſtles were infallible, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, if your deduction be good, the infallibility of the Church
muſt be greater, than that of the Apoſtles, becauſe the Foundation muſt
be ſtronger, than the Edifice; and ſo, your owne argument, directly
overthrowes, that which you would proue by it.</p>
               <p n="36">36. By what I haue now ſayd, your other reaſon in the
ſame place is anſwered; <hi>That a dependent infallibility, (eſpecially
if the dependance be voluntary) cannot be ſo certaine, as that on which it
depends: But the infallibility of the Church, depends vpon the infallibility of
Apoſtles, as the ſtreightneſſe of the thing regulated, vpon the
ſtreightneſſe of the Rule: and beſides, this dependance is voluntary,
for it is in the power of the Church to deviate from this Rule; being nothing
els but an agregation of men, of which every one has freewill, and is ſubject
to paſſions and errour. Therfore the Churches infallibility, is not ſo
certaine as that of the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="37">37. Anſwer. How many flawes appeare in theſe not many
words? And to omit, that of Dependance, this Reaſon is not diſtinct from
the former taken from the metaphor of a Foundation, to which muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Reaſon for which we aſſent to a thing, and which therfore is the
foundation on which our aſſent depends, I ſay; Firſt. Your
conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not contrary to the Aſſertion of your adverſary. A foule
fault in Logicke, which teaches that alwayes the concluſion of the
diſputant, ought to be directly contradictory, to that which the Defendant
affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and not conſiſtent with it. Otherwiſe the Opponent, would be
diſcovered, to fight with no-body. You conclude; <hi>Therfore the Churches
infallibility, is not ſo certaine, as that of the Apoſtles.</hi> Which is
nothing againſt <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> who proved only, that the Church
is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and infallible in Her Definitions, that they cannot be
falſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to diſpute, whether one certainty, may be greater, then
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and therfore, ſecondly, you miſtake, or wittingly alter the
que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, paſſng from intenſion, or degrees of certainty in order to
the ſame Points, to extenſion of infallibility to different kinds of
objects: as if, though it were granted, that the Apoſtles were more
infallible than the Church intenſiuè, or in reſpect of the ſame
Points, in which both ſhe and the Apoſtles are infallible (becauſe ſhe
depends on the Apoſtles) it muſt follow, that the Church cannot be
extenſiuè as infallible, as they were, that is, cannot be infallible
in Points both Fundamentall, and not Fundamentall; which is a very
inconſequent conſequence; it being <pb n="734" facs="tcp:59214:382"/>ſufficient, that
the A poſtles be more infallible than the Church quoad modum; ſeing ſhe
depends on them, and they not on her, as the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles were not ſo
infallible intenſiuè as our Saviour; and yet you will not inferr, that
their infallibility alſo muſt be ſo limited extenſivè, as not to
reach to vnfundamentall Points; and as the Church, for Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Points, is
builded, and depends vpon the Apoſtles, and ſo, quoad modum, not ſo
infallible, as they were; yet Proteſtants grant, that ſhe is abſolutly
infallible in fuch Points, though for them, ſhe depend on the Apoſtles; and
your reaſon is againſt this infallibility, as well as againſt her
infallibility in Points not Fundamentall, and therfore proves in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thirdly: according to this your diſcourſe, no naturall truth, can be
inferred, with certainty, from the moſt common, and knowne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of
naturall reaſon; as, Nothing can be, and not be, at the ſame tyme. Every
whole is greater than any one part included therin, and the like; becauſe,
whatſoever is inferred from ſuch knowne Axiomes muſt depend on them, and
therfore not be certaine, nor infallible. If then your meaning be, that the
Church is not abſolutely infallible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe depends on the
infallibility of the Apoſtles; your Reaſon is manifeſtly falſe: If you
meane, that ſhe may be abſolutly infallible, though not ſo infallible as
the Apoſtles, quoad modum, you ſpeake not to the purpoſe, but grant as
much as we deſire.</p>
               <p n="38">38. You ſay: <hi>It is in the power of the Church to
deviate from this Rule</hi> (that is, from the Doctrine, and infallibility of
the Apoſtles) <hi>being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els out an aggregation of men, of which
every one has freewill, and is ſubject to pasſions, and errour.</hi> And
were not the Apoſtles an <hi>aggregation of men, of which every one had
freewill, and was ſubject to pasſions and errour,</hi> if they had beene
left to themſelves? And therfore by your Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it was in their power to
deviate from the infallibility, which the Holy Ghoſt did offer to them. I
wonder you durſt publiſh ſuch Groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Atheiſme. But is the Church
indeed, <hi>nothing elſe but an aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men ſubject to pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſions and errour?</hi> Hath
ſhe not a promiſe of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne aſſiſtance, even according to
Proteſtants, againſt all Fundamentall errours? which ſurely is more than
to be, nothing elſe, than an aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, ſubject to paſſions,
and errours even Fundamentall? And as for freewill: I aske, whether that be
taken away, by the Churches infallibility in Fundamentall Points, or no. If
not, then freewill, may well conſiſt with infallibility. If it be taken
away; then what abſurdity is it to ſay, that it is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by
infallibility in Points not Fudame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall? <pb n="735" facs="tcp:59214:382"/>In aword:
whatſoever you anſwer about infallibility and freewill in the Apoſtles,
for all Points; and in the Church for Fundamentall articles; the ſame will
ſerue to confute your owne Objection, and ſhew, that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict your
owne doctrine, and the Doctrine of Proteſtants, yea of all Chriſtians, who
belieue the Apoſtles to be infallible. But of this I haue ſpoken hertofore,
more than once, and will now paſſe to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of your anſwer to
the argument of <hi>Charity Maintayned;</hi> that by Potters manner of
interpreting, thoſe texts of Scripture, which ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake of the ſtability,
and infallibility of the Church, and limiting it to Points Fundamentall, he may
affirme, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that the Apoſtles, and other Writers
of Canonicall Scripture, were endued with infallibility, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſetting
downe Points Fundamentall. For, if it be vrged, that all Scripture is divinely
inſpired; Potter hath affoarded you a ready an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that Scripture is
inſpired, only in thoſe parts or parcells, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it delivereth
Fundamentall Points.</q> Of theſe words of <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> you
take no notice, but only ſay, that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>All Scripture
is divinely inſpired. Shew but as much for the Church: ſhew where it is
written, that all the decrees of the Church are divinely inſpired; and the
Controverſy will be at an end.</hi> But all this is not to the purpoſe, to
ſhew by what Law, Rule, Priviledge, or evident Text of Scripture, you take
vpon you, to reſtraine generall Promiſes (made for the Church) to Points
Fundamentall, and not limite thoſe words, <hi>All Scripture is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inſpired,</hi> to the ſame Fundamentall Points. For, this you neither doe,
nor are able to anſwer; but diſſemble that <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi>
did expreſſly prevent your alledging this very Text, <hi>All Scripture is
divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely inſpired.</hi> Nay, beſide this, you do not ſhew, by what
authority, you do not only reſtraine the Praedicatum, (divinitus inſpirata)
but alſo the ſubjectum togeather with the ſigne, all, (All Scripture)
which not only may, but in your doctrine, muſt be limited, in a ſtrange
manner; ſeing you teach, that ſome Part of Scripture, is infallible neither
in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, nor vnfundamentall Points. For here, (N. 32.) you endeavour
to proue that S. Paul hath delivered ſome <hi>things as the dictates of
hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon and prudence, and not as Divine Revelation:</hi> And ſo it
will not be vniverſally true, for any kind of Points, that All Scripture, is
divinely inſpired. How then will you proue by theſe words, that Scripture
is infallible in all Points, if yourſelfe limite the Subjectum of that
Propoſition, which is Scripture, to certaine Parts of Scripture, and that
indeed the Praedicatum, (divinely inſpired) may be limited to Fundamentall
Points, vpon as good ground, as you limite the generall <pb n="736" facs="tcp:59214:383"/>promiſes ef God, and words of Scripture, which concerne the
infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church?</p>
               <p n="39">39. But, (N. 33.) you will proue that Dr. Potter limits
not <hi>the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles infallibility to truths abſolutely neceſſary to
ſalvation, becauſe he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to the Apoſtles the Spirits guidance, and
conſequently, infallibility in a more high and abſolute manner, than to any
ſince them:</hi> and to proue this ſequele, you offer vs a needleſſe
Syllogiſme. But I haue ſhewd, that the Apoſtles, may haue infallibility
in a more high, abſolute, and independent manner, than the Church, although
the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, reach to Points not Fundamentall; as Proteſtants
will not deny, that the Apoſtles had infallibility in Fundamentall Points, in
a more high manner, than the Church hath; though yet ſhe be abſolutely
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in all Fundamentall articles. Yea, if you will haue the Doctour
ſpeake properly; to ſay, the Apoſtles had the guidance of the Spirit in a
more high manner than the Church, muſt ſuppoſe, that the Church hath that
guidance, and conſequently (as you inferr) infallibility; though not in ſo
high a manner as the Apoſtles. I intreate the Reader to peruſe <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> (N. 13.) and judge whether he ſpeakes not with all reaſon,
and proves what he ſaith in this behalfe; and if Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter declare himſelfe
otherwiſe, and teach (notwithſtanding his owne confeſſion, that what
was promiſed to the Apoſtles, is verifyed alſo in the vniverſall
Church) that the Church, may erre in Points not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, I can only
favour him, and you, ſo far, as to tell you, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Whatſoever you ſay to the contrary, <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> (N. 13.) ſpoke truth, in affirming, that Potter, <hi>Speakes
very dangerouſly towards this purpoſe</hi> (of limitting the Apoſtles
infallibility to Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Points.) For though the Doctor name the Church,
when he ſaieth (Pag: 152.) (that there <hi>are many millions of truths in
Nature, and Hiſtory, whereof the Church is ignorant; and that many truths lie
vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the infinite treaſurie of Gods wiſdome, where with the
Church is not acquainted</hi>) yet his reaſons, either proue nothing, or els
muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the Apoſtles, no less than the Church, as <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly obſerves (Pag: 93.) though I grant that ſome
of the Doctors words, agree only to the Church, which is nothing againſt
<hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> that other of Potters words and reaſons agree
alſo to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and therefore I aſſure you he had no deſigne
in the (&amp;c) at which you carp. But let the Doctour ſay, and meane, what
he beſt pleaſes; ſure <pb n="737" facs="tcp:59214:383"/>I am, that neither he nor
you, will ever be able to proue, by any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Text of Scripture, that the
foreſayd, or other generall promiſes of infallibility, extend to all
ſorts of Points for the Apoſtles, and to Fundamentall Articles only, for
the Church. And this is the maine buſineſſe in hand. Though in the meane
tyme, I muſt not omit to ſay, that your Syllogiſme is very captious, and
deceitfull, which is: <hi>He that grants the Church infallible in
Fundamentalls, and aſcribes to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles the infallible guidance of the
Spirit, in a more high and abſolute man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than to any ſince them, limits
not the Apoſtles infallibility to Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls: But Dr: Potter grants to
the Church, ſuch a limited infallibility, and aſcribes to the Apoſtles,
the Spirits infallible guidance in a more high, and abſolute manner: Therfore
he limits not the Apoſtles infallibility to Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls.</hi> I ſay, the
Major, of this Syllogiſme, on which all depends, is deceitfull. For though
<hi>he that grants the Church infallible in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, and aſcribes to
the Apoſtles the infallible guidance of the Spirit, in a more high, and
abſolute manner than to any ſince them, limits not the Apoſtles
infallibility to Fundamentalls,</hi> by only, and preciſely, granting the
Church infallible in Fundamentalls, and aſcribing to the Apoſtles, the
guidance of the Spirit in a more high manner, yet he may doe it by ſome other
way, and in particular, by the meanes of which now we ſpeake, that is, by
reſtraining the ſelfe ſame words of Scripture, which without
diſtinction ſpeak of the Apoſtles, and the Church, to Fundamentall Points
in reſpect of the Church, and not in order to the Apoſtles, and this
voluntarily, without proofe from any other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Text of Scripture, which
yet in the Grounds of Proteſtants, were neceſſary in this caſe: As
alſo, by proving the fallibility of the Church by Arguments, which muſt
involue the Apoſtles no leſſe than the Church, as even now I haue proved.
Howſoever; that you are not a faithfull interpreter of Dr: Potter, appeares
by your ſaying, <hi>He out of curteſy grants you, that thoſe words, the
Spirit ſhall lead you into all Truth, and ſhall abide with you for ever,
though in their high and moſt abſolute ſenſe, they agree only to the
Apoſtles, yet in a conditionall, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, moderate, ſecondary ſenſe,
they may be vnderſtood of the Church.</hi> For, where doth Dr: Potter ſay,
that theſe words agree to the Church in a conditionall ſenſe? Which
conditionall ſenſe you interpret (N. 34.) to ſingify, if the Church
adhere to the direction of the Apoſtles, and ſo far as ſhe doth adhere to
it; which overthrowes the doctrine of Potter, and other Proteſtants, that the
Church is abſolutely infallible, and <pb n="738" facs="tcp:59214:384"/>cannot erre in
Fundamentall Points; in which yet ſhe might erre, if the promiſe of our
Saviour, were only conditionall, and it would giue no more to the Church, than
to any private perſon, who is ſure not to erre, not only in Fundamentall,
but even in vnfundamentall Points, as far as he adheres to the direction of the
Apoſtles. And by this reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the difficulty againſt Dr: Potter, and
you, growes to be greater; how the ſame words of Scripture, are vnderſtood
both of the Apoſtles, and of the Church, abſolutely for Points
Fundamentall; and only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, for the Church, in Points not
Fundamentall: And how will you be able to proue, this various acception of the
ſame words, in order to the ſame Church (and not only in reſpect of the
Apoſtles, and the Church) by any other evident Text of Scripture? You ſay
to <hi>Cha: Ma: Do you not bluſh for ſhame at this Sophiſtry? The Doctour
ſayes (which yet, I know, he never intended,) no more was promiſed in this
place; therfore he ſayes, no more was promiſed. Are there not other places
beſides this? And may not that be promiſed in other places, which is not
promiſed in this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="41">41. Anſwer. If the Doctour ſpoke beyond, or contrary
to what he intended, I cannot wonder; ſince, whoſoever defends a bad
cauſe, is ſubject to write contradictions, which yet men intend no to doe.
You ſay, there may be other places beſides this. I anſwer: It is neither
in your, nor in any mans power, to alledg any place, which may not be
interpreted, and reſtrayned, as you limit this of which we ſpeake.
Certainly, the Doctour being to proue the abſolute infallibility of the
Apoſtles, was much to blame, for alledging ineffectuall Texts, if He could
haue found better. Indeed I find in his (Pag: 152.) theſe words: <hi>That
other promiſe of Chriſts being with his</hi> (Matth: 28.20.) <hi>vnto the
end of the world, is properly meant (as ſome Ancients truly giue the
ſenſe) of his comfortable ayde and aſſiſtance, ſupporting the
weakneſſe of his Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and their Succeſſours in their
Miniſtery, or preaching of Chriſt. But it may well be alſo applyed, as it
is by others, 
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">5. Leo Scrm: 10, de Nativ: Cap:
5.</note> to the Church vniverſall: Which is ever in ſuch manner
aſſiſted by the good Spirit, that it never to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally falls from
Chriſt.</hi> But as in the other Texts, ſo in this, the Queſtion returnes
to be asked, by what evident place, of Scripture, can you, or He proue, that
this Text ſpeakes of an vniverſall Aſſiſtance for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and only a limited direction for the Church, ſeeing Potter grants, that
<hi>it may well be alſo applyed, as it is by others, to the Church
vniverſall?</hi> You could ſay (N. 30.) <hi>Shew where it is written, that
all the Decrees of the Church are divinely inſpired, and the Controverſy
will be at <pb n="739" facs="tcp:59214:384"/>an end.</hi> And much more may we ſay to
you; Shew ſome evidenr Text of Scripture, that the Apoſtles are infallible
in all Points Fundamentall, and not Fundamentall, the Church only in
Fundamentalls, or that any Text of Scripture makes any ſuch diſtinction. I
ſay much more may we ſay, Shew &amp;c. Becauſe the truth, Authority, and
infallibility of the Church, is proved independently of Scripture, as the
infallibility of the Apoſtles, was proved before any Scripture of the New
Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was written. But you, who hold, that we can belieue nothing, as a
matter of Faith, vnleſſe it be evidently ſet downe in Scripture, are
obliged, either to proue the difference of infallibility in the Apoſtles and
the Church, by ſome evident Text of Scripture, or els you cannot be
aſſured of it, as a thing revealed by God. You ſee how hard you were
preſſed, and therfore were forced to giue this noble anſwer; That Dr.
Potter out of courteſy grants vs, that thoſe words, <hi>The ſpirit
ſhall lead you into all truth, and ſhall abide with you for ever, in a
conditionall, limited, moderate, ſecondary ſenſe, may be vnderſtood of
the Church.</hi> But I haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, that you miſalledge the Doctour, who
ſayes expreſſly, that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was directly and primarily made to
the Apoſtles, and is verifyed in the Church vniverſall.</hi> Now I aske,
whether, or no, it be true; that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is verifyed in the Church? If
it be true, that is, if God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it to be ſo, one would thinke it
were no point of ceremony, or cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy, but a matter of neceſſity, to
acknowledge ſo much. It ſeemes, you thinke the Doctour was of your
diſpoſition, who (Pag 69. N. 47.) ſay to <hi>Charity Maintayned; You
might haue met with an anſwerer, that would not haue ſuffered you to haue
ſayd ſo much Truth togeather, but to me it is ſufficient, that it is
nothing to the purpoſe.</hi> But I goe on, and ſay, if it be not true, nor
revealed, that thoſe words are verifyed of the Church, how durſt Potter
affirme, that they were verifyed of Her? Is it lawfull to add to the old, and
coyne new Revelations? Doth not Potter ſay (Pag: 222.) <hi>to add to it</hi>
(he ſpeakes of the Creed) <hi>is high preſumption, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as great as to
detract from it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="42">42. You ſay, The Apoſtles muſt be ledd into all
ſuch truths, <hi>as was requiſite to make them the Churches Founda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

freedome from etrour in all thoſe things which they delivered conſtantly,

               <p n="43">43. I reply; Firſt, The Church muſt be led into

vniverſall infallibility. Secondly ſeing Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines not all
points, neceſſary to be believed, the Church muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with
infallibility for ſuch points: Otherwiſe we could haue no certainty
concerning them. And if once you grant her infallible, for Points not evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in Scripture, you cannot deny her an Infallibility, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, not from evidence
of Scripture, but from the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt. And as you
ſay, the Apoſtles were vniverſally infallible, becauſe the Church was
builded on them; ſo every Chriſtian is builded vpon the Church, and for
that cauſe ſhe muſt be vniverſally infallible. Thirdly; We are not
ſaied to be builded vpon the writings of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, or Scripture, but
vpon the Apoſtles, who were the Foundation of the Church, before they wrote
any thing, by their preaching, and verbum traditum, Tradition. So that indeed,
this Text (Epheſ: 2.20.) makes for vs, and proves, that we are builded on the
vnwritten word, and might haue beene ſo, though no Scripture, had bene
written. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; you ſtill miſtake the Queſtion, and ſeeke
diverſions but never goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to proue by ſome evident Text of Scripture
that the infallibility of the Apoſtles, may not be limited to Fundamentall
Points, as your reſtraine to ſuch Points the generall Promiſes of
infallibility, made to the Church in holy Scripture, and limit the word
Foundation, to the writings of the Apoſtles, which I haue ſhewed to be a
manifeſtly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true limitation. S. Paul (1. Tim: 3.) avouches the Church to be
the Pillar and Ground of Truth, and yet you deny Her to be vniverſally
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. How then can you proue by the word Foundation, (which
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignify no more, than the pillar and Ground of Truth) that the
Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les cannot erre in any Point, but the Church may? Yea even to make this
place, (Epheſ: 2.20.) cleare, and convincing in favour of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
the authority of the Church is neceſſary, and the letter alone will not
ſuffice, if you will regard the doctrine, or authority, of ſome learned
prime Proteſtant. And therfore: Fiftly, you haue cauſe to reſlect on what
Cornelius a Lapide (vpon this place) ſaieth: That Beza (and not he alone)
interprets, (vpon the Foundation of the Apoſtles) to ſignify Chriſt, who
is the Foundation of the Apoſtles, Prophets and the whole Church; and he
(Beza) ſaieth, that it is Antichriſtian, to put an other foundation: For
<hi>no man can put an other Foundation beſide that which is put, Ieſus
Christ.</hi> If this expoſition be admitted, the ſaied Text (Epheſ:
2.20.) will not proue that the Apoſtles, but only that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (the
Foundation of the Apoſtles, and of the Church) was infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, 
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:59214:385"/>nor will the ſtability of a Foundation, expreſſed
in this place of Scripture, belong to the Apoſtles. And albeit indeed this
interpretation be not true, yet to you it ought not to ſeeme evidently
falſe, being the Opinion of ſo great a Rabby; as alſo becauſe it is
very agreable, to the manner which Poteſtants hold, in impugning Catholik
Doctrine, when for example, they argue: The Scripture ſaieth, We haue an
Advocate Jeſus Chriſt. Therfore Saynts, cannot be our Advocates, though in
an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly lower degree, than our Saviour is: Eſpecially if we reflect,
that it is ſaied of our Saviour with a Negatiue, or excluſiue, particle, No
man can put an other Foundation, wheras in thoſe words we haue an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
there is only an affirmation, that Chriſt is our Advocate, but no negation,
that any other is. Other examples might be given in this kind, if this were a
place for it. We do therfore grant that the Apoſtles were Foundations of the
Church, and that they received Revelations imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from our Saviour, and
the Church from them; ſo that, as I ſaied, ſhe depends on them, not they
on Her; and you wrong vs, while (N. 30.) in your firſt Sillogiſme, you
ſpeak in ſuch manner, as the Reader will conceiue that we make the
infallibility of the Church equall, in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, to that of the
Apoſtles, the contrary wherof all Catholikes belieue, and proue. I omit to
obſerue, that you take occaſion to deſcant vpon theſe words (as well)
which are not found in <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> though for the thing
itſelfe he might haue vſed them. Your (N. 31. and 32.) haue beene already
confuted at large, and the words of Dr. Stapleton conſidered, and defended
with ſmall credit to Dr. Potter, and you.</p>
               <p n="44">44 You ſay: (N. 34.) he teaches the promiſes of
Infallibility made to the Apoſtles to be verifyed in the Church, <hi>but not
in ſo abſolute a manner. Now what is oppoſed to abſolute but limited or
reſtrained?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="45">45. Anſwer. firſt our Queſtion, is not, what Dr.
Potter ſaied, but what he did, or could proue; and in particular I ſay, it
cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any evident Text of Scripture, that the words which he
confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be verifyed in the Church, are limited to fundamentall
points, in reſpect of her, and not as they are referred to the Apoſtles.
Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; wheras you ſay; <hi>what is oppoſed to abſolute, but limited
or reſtrained?</hi> I reply; abſolute may be taken in diverſe ſenſes,
according to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, argument, or ſubject, to which it is applied; and
therfore though ſome tyme it may be oppoſed to limited, yet not alwayes. Do
not you (N. 33.) oppoſe to abſolute, a conditionall, moderate, ſecondary
ſenſe, which being epithetons much different one from an other giue vs to 
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:59214:386"/>vnderſtand, that you are too reſolute in asking, what
is oppoſed to (but limited) ſeing more things than one may be oppoſed to
it. What Logician will not tell you, that in Logick, not Limited, but Relatiue,
is oppoſed to abſolute? And we may alſo ſay, that the infallibility of
the Apoſtles was abſolute, that is, independent, and the infallibility of
the Church, dependent, as the Effect depends on the Cauſe, and ſo is not
abſolute, in that ſenſe, but hath a Relation of dependance to the
infallibility of the Apoſtles, as to its Cauſe, which particular Relation
the Apoſtles haue not to the Church.</p>
               <p n="46">46. You ſay alſo (N. 34.) that though it were
ſuppoſed, that God had <hi>obliged himſelf by promiſe, to giue his
Apoſtles infallibility, only in things neceſſary to ſalvation,
nevertheless it is vtterly inconſequent, that he gaue them no more; or that
we can haue no aſſurance of any farther aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, that he gaue
them: Eſpecially when he himſelf, both by his word, and by his works hath
aſſured vs, that he did aſſiſt them farther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="47">47. Anſwer; I know not to what purpoſe, or vpon what
occaſion you vtter theſe words. Only I am ſure, that they containe, both
a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt falſhood, and contradiction to yourſelf, who ſay heere (N.
33.) <hi>If we once ſuppoſe they</hi> (the Apoſtles) <hi>may haue erred
in ſome things of this nature</hi> (in things which they delivered
conſtantly, as certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Truths) <hi>it will be vtterly
vndiſcernable what they haue erred in, and what they haue not.</hi> Now if
God hath promiſed to giue his Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility only in things
neceſſary to ſalvation, (which heere you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly ſuppoſe,) it
is cleare we cannot be certaine of the truth of their writings in any one
thing: Which ſuppoſed; (that we cannot be certaine that their writings are
true) how can you ſay, that God <hi>both by his word, and by his works hath
aſſured vs, that he aid aſſiſt them far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> Seing (vpon that
ſuppoſition) the Scripture may be falſe, and recount works never wrought,
and ſo, it is conſequent, that we can haue no aſſurance (by his written
word) of any farther aſſiſtance that God gaue them, (if it be
ſuppoſed that he gaue them infallibility, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in things neceſſary to
ſalvation;) which is the contradictory to your aſſertion, and yet it is
evidently deduced from your owne express words, and doctrine. Nay you could not
be ſure, that the Apoſtles had infallibility, even for Fundamentall Points,
if once it be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they, and conſequently, their writings,
were ſubject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in any thing. So farr from truth is your ſaying (we
could haue aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of farther aſſiſtance!) Your (N. 35.36.)
containe no difficulty, <pb n="743" facs="tcp:59214:386"/>which hath not bene anſwered
heretofore.</p>
               <p n="48">48. I wiſh you had in your (N. 37.) ſet downe at
large the words of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> whereby he proves (N. 15.) that
according to the grounds of Proteſtants, it is ſufficient for ſalvation,
that Scripture be infallible in Fundamentall Points only, as they limit to
ſuch Points, the infallibility of the Church, and accordingly, interpret
Scriptures, ſpeaking thereof. 
<q rend="margQuotes">The ſumme of his Diſcourſe is
this: Put together theſe Doctrines: That Scripture cannot erre in Points
Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; that they cleerely containe all ſuch Points; that
Proteſtants can tell what Points in particular be Fundamentall; it is
manifeſt, that it is ſufficient for ſalvation, that Scripture be
infallible only in Points Fundamentall.</q> For ſeing, all are obliged to
belieue explicitely all Fundamentall Articles, it is neceſſary to know
which in particular be Fundamentall; which Proteſtants cannot know, except by
Scripture, which alone in their grounds, containes all that is neceſſary
for vs to knowe; and therefore knowing by Scripture, what Points in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
be Fundamentall, (as N. 40. you ſay expreſſly, men <hi>may learne from
the Scripture, that ſuch Points are Fundamentall, others are not ſo</hi>)
and that Scripture is infallible in all Fundamentalls, they are ſure that it
is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in ſuch particular neceſſary Articles, though it were
ſuppoſed to be fallible in other Points; by this Argument: All Fundamentall
Points are delivered in Scripture with infallibility; this is a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Point; therefore it is delivered in Scripture with infallibility. And the
Syllogiſme at which you ſay men would laugh, is only your owne; <hi>The
Scripture is true in ſomething; the Scripture ſayes that theſe Points
only are Fundamentall, therefore this is true, that theſe are ſo. For,</hi>
ſay you, <hi>every freſh-man in Logick knowes that from meere particulars
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be certainly concluded.</hi> But you ſhould correct your
Syllogiſme, thus: All that is neceſſary, the Scripture delivers with
infallibility; but to know what Points in particular be Fundamentall, is
neceſſary; therefore the Scripture delivers it with infallibility.
Beſides, you ſay; <hi>If without dependance on Scripture Proteſtants did
know what were Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, and what not, they might poſſibly belieue the
Scripture true in Fundamentalls, and erroneous in other things.</hi> Now both
you and Potter affirme, that there is an vniverſall Tradition, that the Creed
contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes all Fundamentall Points, and conſequently, that in vertue of
ſuch a Tradition, men may belieue all Fundamentall Points, without
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, or knowledg of Scripture, as alſo for vniverſall Tradition 
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:59214:387"/>you belieue Scripture itſelf. Heare your owne words
(Pag: 198. N. 15.) <hi>The certainty I haue of the Creed, that it was from the
Apoſtles, and containes the Principles of Faith, I ground it not vpon
ſcripture;</hi> Therefore according to your owne grounds, Proteſtants may
belieue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be true in Fundamentalls, and erroneous in other
things. And you did not well, to conceale this Argument, taken from the Creed,
which was expreſſly vrged by <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> in that very (N. 15.) which
you anſwer. By what I haue ſaied, it appeares, that, (in the grounds of
Proteſtants) the knowledg of Fundamentalls neede not haue for Foundation, the
vniverſall truth of Scripture, as you ſay, but only the truth thereof for
all Fundamentall Points, and for knowing what Points in particular be
Fundamentall, as I haue declared. So we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Argument of
<hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> ſtands good; that if you limit the infallibility of the
Church, you may vpon the ſame ground, limit the infallibility of the
Apoſtles, and their writings, namely, the Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p n="49">49. Your (N. 39.) goes vpon a meere equivocation, or a
voluntary miſtake, you being not ignorant that <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi>
ſaied (N. 16.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">that no Proteſtant, can with
aſſurance believe the vniverſall Church in Points not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall,
becauſe they belieue that in ſuch points she may erre; which ſequele is
very true, and cleare.</q> For how can I belieue with aſſurance, an
Authority believed to be fallible. If ſhe alledg ſome evident Reaſon,
Scripture, &amp;c: I belieue her, no more than I would belieue any child, Turk,
or Jewe, and ſo I attribute nothing to her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor can be ſaied to
belieue her. Thus you ſay (N. 36.) We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belieue the <hi>preſent
Church in propounding Canonicall Bookes, vpon her owne Authority</hi> though we
may for other reaſons belieue <hi>theſe Bookes to be Canonicall which ſhe
propoſes.</hi> Your inſtances are againſt yourſelf. For if the divell
proue that there is a God, or a Geometritian demonſtrate ſome concluſion,
I neither belieue the divell, who I knowe, was a Lier from the beginning, nor
the Geometritian, whom I knowe to be falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but I aſſent for the
Reaſon which they giue, by whomeſoever it had bene given: and therfore you
ſpeak a contradictory, in ſaying (N. 38.) <hi>Though the Church being not
infallible I cannot belieue Her in every thing ſhe ſayes, yet I can and
muſt belieue her in every thing she proves, either by Scripturs, or
vniverſall Tradition.</hi> This I ſay, implies a contradiction, to belieue,
one becauſe he proves; ſeing the formall object, or Motiue of Beliefe, is
the Authority of the ſpeaker, and not the Reaſon which he 
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:59214:387"/>gives, which may produce aſſents of diverſe kinds,
according to the diverſity of Reaſons, as Demonſtration, Scripture
&amp;c: which may cauſe an infallible aſſent, not poſſible to be
produced by the authority of the Church, if it were fallible.</p>
               <p n="50">50. In your (N. 39.) Firſt you cite the words of
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> thus: <hi>The Churches infallible direction
extending only to Fundamentalls, vnless I know them before I goe to learne of
her, I may be rather delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded than inſtructed by her;</hi> and then you
ſay: <hi>The Reaſon and connexion of this conſequence, I feare neither I
nor you doe well vnderſtand.</hi> But you feare, where there is no cauſe of
feare. For, is it not a cleare conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that if the Church be infallible
only in Fundamentall points, and I haue recourſe to her about any matter, not
knowing it to be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, I cannot be ſure, but that ſhe may erre
therin? We haue hard yourſelfe ſaying; <hi>of meere particulars nothing can
be certainly concluded,</hi> and (to vſe your owne words) who would not laugh
at him, who ſhould argue thus? the Church is infallible in ſome things; the
Church ſaith this is true, Therfore it is true. Or thus: the Church is
infallible only in fundamentall Points, The Church ſaieth, this particular is
true, which I know not whether, or not it be Fundamentall, therfore the Church
is infallible in this. The concluſion ſhould be: Therfore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know
that the Church is infallible in this. You ſay, (N. 37.) that the Scripture
muſt be vniverſally true, and not only in fundamentalls, becauſe
otherwiſe it <hi>could not be a ſufficient warrant to belieue this thing,
that theſe only points are Fundamentall,</hi> which ſhewes, your opinion to
be, that it would litle availe vs, to know that Scripture is infallible in
fundamentalls only, vnless we could know, what Points in particular are
fundamentall, and therfore you impugne yourſelf, while you find fault with
<hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> for ſaying, that if the Church be infallible only in
fundamentalls, we cannot belieue her <hi>with certainty vnless we know, that
ſuch and ſuch things are Fundamentall.</hi> The reſidue of this Number
(39.) you ſpend in diſtinguiſhing between being infallible in
fundamentalls and being an infallible guide in fundamentalls; of which I haue
alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſpoken at larg.</p>
               <p n="51">51. In your (N. 40.) you cite theſe words as out of
<hi>Char. Maintayn. They that knowe what Points are Fundamentall, otherwiſe
then by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Authority, learne not of the Church. Char. Maint.</hi>
ſpeakes more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, and ſayeth: 
<q rend="margQuotes">If before they address themſelves to
the Church, they muſt know what points are Fundamentall, they learne not of
her <pb n="746" facs="tcp:59214:388"/>but wilbe as fit to teach, as to be taught by her.
How then are all Chriſtians ſo often, ſo ſeriouſly, vpon ſo
dreadfull menaces, by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Scriptures, and our bleſſed Saviour
himſelf, counſelled, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſeeke, to heare, to obey the
Church?</q> Which he proves there at large out of S. Auſtine, and S.
Chryioſtome. And is not all this very cleare? For, how can I be ſaied to
learne of the Church, that which I muſt know before ſhe can teach me, that
is, what Points be Fundamentall? <hi>Yes,</hi> ſay you, <hi>they may learne
of the Church, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the word of God, and from the Scripture,
that ſuch Points are Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, others are not ſo, and conſequently
learne, even of the Church, even of your Church, that all is not Fundamentall,
nay all is not true, which she teaches vs to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="52">52. Anſwer: Firſt; can we indeed <hi>learne from the
Scripture, that ſuch Points are Fundamentall, others are not ſo?</hi> How
then do you ſay, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to giue a Catalogue of Fundamentall
Points, ſeing there is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to know <hi>that ſuch Points are
Fundamentall, others are not ſo?</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; You grant what <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> ſaied; That I cannot learne of the Church, that which I
muſt know before ſhe teaches me; while you tell vs, that men learne of the
Church one thing, <hi>that Scripture is the Word of God,</hi> and an other from
Scripture, namely, what Points be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, and ſo we are ſo far from
learning of the Church that fuch points are Fundamentall, that we are as fit to
teach her, as ſhe to teach vs, which Points in particular be Fundamentall,
which we learne from Scripture, not from her; juſt as you teach, that not
from the Church, but from Scripture, we learne all particular Points of Faith
with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, though we receiue the Scripture from the Church. Thirdly; If
it be a Fundamentall truth, that Scripture is the Word of God, I muſt know it
to be ſuch, before I can be aſſured, that the Church cannot erre therin,
and ſo I cannot learne it of the Church; and much less can I learne it of the
Church, with certainty, if it be not a Fundamentall Point, in which you hold
the Church may erre: and (Pag: 116. N. 159.) you ſay, it is not a
Fundamentall point. Fourthly; Whereas you ſay, That one may learne from the
Church, that <hi>Scripture is the Word of God, and from the Scripture, that all
is not true which the Church teacheth to be ſo;</hi> I anſwer: if we
belieue Scripture to be the word of God, vpon the ſole Authority of the
Church, it is impoſſible, that I can proue out of Scripture, <hi>that all
is not true, which the Church teacheth to be ſo.</hi> For, by this meanes
Scripture would be deſtructiue of it ſelf, if we belieue it 
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:59214:388"/>for an Authority, which it ſelf ſaieth may affirme a
falſhood, and ſo we cannot belieue it even in this particular, that
Scripture is the word of God. Yourſelf ſay heere (N. 36.) <hi>An Authority
ſubject to errour can be no firme or ſtable Foundation of my belief in any
thing, and if it were in any thing, then this Authority being one and the
ſame in all propoſalls, I ſhould haue the ſame reaſon to belicue all,
that I haue to belieue one: and therfore muſt either do vnreaſonably, in
believing any one thing, vpon the ſole warrant of this Authority, or
vnreaſonably in not believing all things equally warranted by it.</hi>
Therfore you either do vnreaſonably in believing the Scripture vpon the
ſole warrant of the Church, or vnreaſonably in not believing her in all her
propoſalls; and Luther was, and all Proteſtants, are, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, in
ſaying, <hi>that all is not true, which the Church teacheth to be ſo.</hi>
You ſay (N. 40.) <hi>Neither do I ſee what hinders, but a man may learne of
a Church how to confute the errours of that Church which taught him: As well as
of my Maſter in Phyſick, or Mathematicks, I may learne thoſe rules a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
Principles, by which I may confute my Maſters erroneous Concluſions.</hi>
But if the ground which I haue laied, and corfirmed out of your owne words, be
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, this your inſtance will proue againſt yourſelf. For if I
belieue thoſe Rules or Principles, becauſe I belieue my Maſter cannot
erre, and not for the evidence of them in themſelves, I do vnreaſonably, in
not believing whatſoever he propoſes; Otherwiſe I may feare he erred even
in thoſe Rules, if once I ſinde him to erre in any other thing. Now, we
receiue with certainty, Scripture for the ſole Authority of the Church, and
therfore we do vnreaſonably, if we belieue her not, in all her
propoſalls.</p>
               <p n="53">53. Your (N. 41.42.) haue bene anſwered hertofore. In
your (N. 43.) you ſpeake to <hi>Ch: Ma.</hi> in this manner: <hi>In the next
place you tell vs, out of S. Auſtine, That that which has bene alwayes kept,
is moſt rightly, eſteemed to come from the Apoſtles. Very right, and what
then? Therefore the Church cannot erre indefining Controverſyes. Sir I
beſeech you when you write againe, doe vs the favour, to write nothing but
Syllogiſmes, for I find it ſtill an extreme trouble to find out the
concealed propoſitions, which are to connect the parts of your enthymems. As
now for example I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess vnto you, I am at my wits end, and haue done my
beſt endeavour, to find ſome glue, or ſodder, or cement, or chaine, or
thred, or any thing to tye this antecedent and this conſequent together, and
at length am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to giue it over, and cannot doe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="54">54. Anſwer; If you were in a condition to reply, I
would adviſe <pb n="748" facs="tcp:59214:389"/>you to write, not Syllogiſmes, or
enthymems, but with truth, Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian modeſty, and humility. If there be
any obſcurity in <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned,</hi> you did not find, but make it,
by breaking the thred of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and disjoyning into ſeverall
Numbers of Sections or Yours, that which is delivered in that one continued (N.
16.) which you impugne. For having proved that according to the grounds of
Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, 
<q rend="margQuotes">they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they address themſelves
to the Church, muſt know what Points are Fundamentall, they learne not of
her, but will be as fit to teach, as to be taught by her. And then to confute
this Doctrine, of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, he ſaieth; S. Auſtine was of a very
different mind from Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: If ſaieth he, (Epiſt: 118.) the Church
through the whole world practice any of theſe things, to diſpute whether
that ought to be done, is a moſt inſolent madness. And in an other place he
ſaieth (Lib: 4. de Bapt: Chap: 24.) That which the whole Church holds, and is
not ordained by Councells, but hath alwaies been kept, is moſt rigthly
believed to be delivered by Apoſtolicall authority.</q> Now Sr. I beſeech
you, doe vs the favour to declare whether theſe words of S. Auſtine doe not
proue, that we are to learne of the Church, and her Traditions; and not
preſume to teach her? Which was the very thing which <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi>
affirmed, and proved, not by any Syllogiſme, or enthymem, but by a continued
diſcourſe, as men are wont to doe, which yet might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily drawne into
a Syllogiſme, or ſome other Lawfull Forme of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Argument, if need
were, as any true Diſcourſe may be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p n="55">55. All that you haue (N, 44.45.46.) containes no
difficulty which may not be anſwered, out of the grounds, which I haue Laied
hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Tertullian is rightly alledged for Traditions in generall; but to
the Church belongs the office, of judging in particular, what be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and
Apoſtolicall, or divine Traditions, and not humane inve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions. Neither can it
be prejudiciall to Traditions in generall, that ſome haue bene loſt, as I
hope you will not deny ſome Bookes of Scripture to be Divine, though ſome
haue bene loſt, and ſome conterfaited. In your (N. 46.) you thought it
beſt to diſſemble what <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> alledges out of Withaker (De
Sacra Script: Pag: 678. concerning an Authority of S. Chryſoſtom for
Traditions) <hi>I anſwer, that this is an inconſiderate ſpeach, and
vnworthy ſo great a Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="56">56. In your (N. 47.) you ſpend many words about a
ſentence of S. Auſtine, which, that you may overcome with more eaſe, you
with a <pb n="749" facs="tcp:59214:389"/>pettie policy, divide from the other places, which
<hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> in the ſame (N. 16.) cites out of the ſame Saynt, one
place ſtrengthening an other. Whoſoever reades with due conſideration,
your long diſcourſe will finde, that your ayme was, covertly to vent your
Socinianiſme, againſt the Church, and openly contradict S. Auſtine, while
you pretend to anſwer the ſentences, which <hi>Cha. ma.</hi> cited out of
him, which are theſe (Epiſt: 119.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">the Church being placed betwixt much
chaffe, and cockle, doth tollerate many things;</q> but yet she doth not
approue, nor diſſemble, nor do theſe things which are againſt Faith, or
good life. you ſay; <hi>That becauſe S. Auſtine ſayes, the Church doth
not approue, nor diſſemble; nor doe theſe things which are againſt
Faith or good life, Ch. Ma. concludes, that it never hath done ſo, nor ever
can doe ſo.</hi> And then you add: <hi>But though the Argument hold in Logick
a non poſſe and non eſſe, yet I never heard, that it is would hold back
againe a non eſſe ad non poſſe. The Church cannot doe this, therefore
it does it not, followes with good conſequence: but the Church does not this,
therefore it ſhall neuer doe it, this I belieue will hardly follow: In the
Epiſtle next before to the ſame I anuarius, writing of the ſame matter,
he hath theſe words: It remaines that the thing you enquire of, muſt he of
that third kind of things, which are different in diverſe places. Let euery
one therfore doe, that which he finds done in the Church to which he comes: for
none of them is againſt Faith or good manners. And why do you not infer from
hence, that no particular Church can bring vp any cuſtome that is againſt
Faith or good manners? Certainly this conſequence has as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for
it as the former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="57">57. Anſwer; S. Auſtines meaning to be, that the
Church neither doth, nor can, approue any thing againſt Faith, or good life,
appeares by the very (Epiſt: 1 18.) next before to the ſame Iannarius, as
you ſpeak; where he ſaieth: 
<q rend="margQuotes">If the Church through the whole world
prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe any of theſe things, to diſpute whether that ought to be ſo
done, is a moſt inſolent madnes.</q> Where you ſee the Saynt ſpeakes
not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de facto, but de jure, what ought to be done; and therfore, as I
ſaied, no wonder if you divided the Sentences of S. Auſtine which you found
ſet downe by <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> in the ſame (N. 16.) Beſides,
you ſhould know, that in matters belonging to doctrine of Faith, an
inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Propoſition ordinarily is equivalent to an vniverſall, as for
exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, God approves not ſinne, the Church eres not in fundamentall Points
of Faith; Works of Chriſtian Piety require the aſſiſtance of Gods
Grace; He that believes not, ſhall be damned &amp;c:? And indeed how 
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:59214:390"/>could S. Auſtine ſay vniverſally, of all tymes, and
places, without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, the Church doth not this, but by ſuppoſing,
that it is certaine, ſhe will never doe it, which muſt implie ſome
particular Priviledg of Divine aſſiſtance, ſecuring her from doing it.
For if he ſpoke only of a caſuall, and contingent thing, for a determinate
tyme, he could not be ſure of what he affirmed, ſeing it might be done in
ſome place, without his knowledg: and whoſoever vnpartially conſiders
theſe words, The Church does not this, will confess that they ſignify,
ſhe never does it, and that ſomething is attributed to Her, which agrees
not to private perſons, caſually not doing a thing. Which alſo appeares
by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis he puts betweene the Church, and chaffe and cockle, that
is imperfections, or ſuperſtitions, of which he ſpeaks. Your Argument
taken from a particular Church, is of no force. For you confess S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
ſpeaks of things indifferent, and rhen I grant, that 
<q rend="margQuotes">no particular Church can bring vp any
cuſtome againſt Faith or good manners,</q> as long as ſhe practiſes
only things indifferent, that is, neither comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor prohibited. But as
for the thing it ſelf, S. Auſtine never ſpeaks of particular Churches, as
we haue heard him ſpeak of the vniverſall, both in this place, of which we
treate, and in other ſentences alledged by <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> in the ſaied
(N. 16.) and the Promiſes of our Saviour, were made to the vniverſall
Church. Yea, you confess that S. Auſtine ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king even in this place, of
thoſe things which he diſlikes, <hi>ſaies that they were neither
contained in Scripture, decreed by Councells, nor corroborated by the cuſtome
of the vniverſall Church;</hi> which words declare, that the Scripture,
Generall Councells, the Cuſtome of the vniverſall Church, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Church of God, can never be ſaied to approue any ſuch
preſumptions, as S. Auſtine calls them; which he never ſaieth of
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches. And therfore when you ſay, that ſuperſtitions
<hi>may in tyme take ſuch deepe roote, as to pass for vniverſall cuſtomes
of the Church,</hi> you contradict S. Auſtine; and that the world may ſee
you doe it plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely, and as I may ſay in actu ſignato, and not only
exercito, but to his face, you take his owne words, Conſuetudine vniverſae
Eccleſiae robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum, <hi>corroborated by the cuſtome of the vniverſall
Church,</hi> and ſay, that <hi>ſome ſuch ſuperſtition had not
already, even in S. Auſtines tyme</hi> (which circumſtance of tyme is to be
noted to ſhew how directly you contradict him) <hi>prevailed ſo farre, as
to be corroborated by the cuſtome of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church, who can doubt,
that conſiders, that the practiſe of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Infants, had even then
got the credit, and Authority, not oily of an <pb n="751" facs="tcp:59214:390"/>vniuerſall cuſtome, but alſo of an Apoſtolique
Tradition?</hi> And which is more, in other places of your Booke, you aſcribe
this very thing which you call ſuperſtition, not only to S. Auſtines
tyme, but even to himſelf, though both imputations be moſt falſe; and it
is ſtrang that through your whole Book, you do not ſo much as once offer
any one proofe thereof. And yet to ſhew how cauſeleſly, and intemperately
you declai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me againſt the Church of S. Auſtines tyme, (that you might
diſcredit every Church of every Age, and ſo of all Ages, though
Proteſtants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hold that the Church was pure in S. Auſtines tyme)
you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess he ſaieth, they were not againſt Faith, and only vnprofitable
bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. But of things that are apertiſſimè contra Fidem,
ſanamque doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinam, he expreſly declares that the truth is to be
profeſſed: Yea even when there is queſtion, not whether a vaine thing be
to be permitted, but whether a good thing ought to be omitted, he ſaieth, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Si aliquorum infirmitas ita impediat,

ſo indiſcretely zealous, as to ſay, that no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient things, are in
any caſe to be tolerated, not for feare to offend, or for humane reſpects,
but for avoiding greater evill, you impugne our Saviour (and not his Church
only) who (Matth. 13.29.30.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">forbids the ſervants to gather vp the
cockle, leaſt perhaps gathering vp the coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, you may root vp the wheat

do very wickedly, in comparing the obſerving this adviſe of our Bleſſed
Saviour, to that which He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Scribes, and Phariſes, for
teaching (and not only tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating perforce) vaine things, as the waſhing of
pots &amp;c: Did not the Apoſtles tolerate, for ſome tyme, even after they
had received the holy Ghoſt, ſome Obſervances of the Moſaicall Law,
till they became to be deadly, as if without them the law of Chriſt had not
beene ſufficient to ſalvation for Gentills converted to Chriſtian
Religion? And for that cauſe S. Paule ſaieth, 
<q rend="margQuotes">ſtand, and be not holden in againe
with the joake of ſervitude</q> (Galat. 5. V. 1.) and therefore, you do
abſurdly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, againſt the Church of Chriſt, thoſe words of the
Apoſtle; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeing you confess, that thoſe fooliſh
obſervances, which S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine diſlikes, were not againſt Faith, (as he
ſaieth expreſſly, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found, quomodo contra Fidem ſint)
and (which is the maine point) that they were never decreed by any generall
Councell, or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, or approved by the vniverſall Church, which is
only our Queſtion. <pb n="752" facs="tcp:59214:391"/>Yourſelf ſay (Pag: 301. N. 101.)
that S. Auſtine ſuppoſed, that <hi>the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique ſervice of God,
wherein men are to communicate is vnpolluted, and no vnlawfull thing
practiſed in their Communion, which was ſo true of their Communion that the
Donatiſts who ſeparated did not deny it.</hi> And towards the end of the
ſame number you ſay, <hi>The Donatiſts ſeparated from the whole world
of Chriſtians, vnited in one Communion, profeſsing the ſame Faith,
ſerving God after the ſame manner, which was a very great Argument, that
they could not haue juſt cauſe to leaue them: according to that of Ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

errour, or the Donatiſts from Schiſme. I haue beene longer in anſwering
this Objection, in regard it containes hiddenly more Socinian venome, againſt

               <p n="58">58. And now it will be eaſy to anſwer your (N. 48.)
wherin you ſpeak thus to <hi>Charity Maintayned. But (you will ſay) not
with ſtanding all this, S. Auſtin here warrants vs, that the Church can
never either approue or diſſemble, or practiſe any thing againſt Faith
or good life, and ſo long you may reſt ſecurely vpon it.</hi> What? Do
you now grant that S. Auſtine here warrants vs, that the Church can never
either approue, &amp;c.? Which is the very thing, which even now you objected
againſt <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> as if S. Auſtine had neither ſaied ſo, not
that it could be deduced from what he ſaied. <hi>You goe forward and ſay;
Yea, but S. Auſtine tells vs in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me place, that the Church may
tolerate humane preſumptions and vaine ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, and thoſe vrged
more ſeverely than the commandements of God: and whether ſuperstition be a
ſinne or no, I appeale to our Saviours words before cited and to the concent
of your Schoolmen. Beſides if we conſider it right, we ſhall finde, that
the Church is not truly ſaied only to tolerate theſe things, but rather,
that a part, and a farre greater publiquely avowed and practiſed them, and
vrged them vpon others with great violence, and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill a part
of the Church. Now why the whole Church might not continue the Church, and yet
doe ſo, as well as a part of the Church might continue a part of it, and yet
do ſo, I deſire you to informe me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="59">59. Anſwer; you ſeeke to deceyue the ignorant, by
leading them into a miſvnderſtanding of the word tolerate, as if it did
ſignify a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary permiſſion, of a thing, when it is in our power to
hinder it; where as the Church doth only tolerate abuſes, in that ſenſe,
as our Saviour teaches, that cockle is to be ſuffered, or, as I may ſay,
tolerated <pb n="753" facs="tcp:59214:391"/>to growe with the wheate, leaſt vntymely
weeding the cockle, ſpoile the good corne; that is, of two vnavoidable
evills, it is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but laudable, yea neceſſary, to chuſe
the leſſer, which, taken formally with compariſon to the greater is in
ſome ſorte, good, as in ſome proportion I declared heretofore, ſpeaking
of the caſe of invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and inculpable Perplexity, as heere the Church is
neceſſitated, without any fault of hers, either to ſuffer a less, or doe
a greater evill, by vntymely, and fruiteless rigor. Did not the Apoſtles; and
muſt not all Prelats permit many ſinnes of diverſe kinds, which they
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder without greater damage to the Chriſtian Commonwealth, vnless
they were Omnipotent, to rule the wills of men, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drawe them,
only to good? But you ſpeak very vnworthily of the vniverſall Church of
Chriſt, when you would make the world belieue, that the farre greater part of
Chriſtians in S. Auſtines tyme, was guilty of vaine ſuperſtitions, and
avowed and practiſed them, yea or even diſſembled them in ſilence, when
prudent Charity, and zeale, could dictate the contrary. As for your parity,
betwen the whole Church, and particular members thereof, it hath bene confuted
heretofore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility being promiſed to the Church, not to private
perſons; and you might make the ſame Argument, to proue that the
Apoſtles, might erre in matters, which they delivered as Points of Faith, and
yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine parts of the Church, as well as particular men might erre, and
remaine members of the Church, if their errours were inculpable. If you ſay
the Apoſtles were to teach others, and ſo could not erre, even inculpably;
you know we ſay the ſame of the Church, which is Judge of Controverſyes,
and was before Scripture, and from which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue true Tradition, Scripture,
and the interpretation thereof. But if we ſuppoſe, that thoſe
ſuperſtitious perſons chanced to erre, in any Point againſt Faith, and
remained obſtinate therein, after ſufficient Declaration of the Churches
Doctrine to the contrary, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came formall Heretiques, excluded from
being members of the Church, and ſo cannot be ſaied, to be either the
greater, or leſſer, or any, part thereof.</p>
               <p n="60">60. In your (N. 49.) You ſay: <hi>But now after all
this adoe, what if S. Auſtane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayes not this which is pretended of the
Church, viz, that ſhe neither approves, nor diſſembles, nor practiſes
any thing againſt Faith or good life, but only of good men of the Church?
Certainly though ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies read as you would haue it, yet you ſhould not

this adoe? Which certainly you would never haue made, vnless you had belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the Common Reading goes as <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> cites it, and for
that cauſe you found it neceſſary, to take ſo much paines, ſpend ſo
many words, and make ſo much adoe, to anſwer it. If an Engliſh
Proteſtant, ſhould cite the Engliſh Tranſlation approved in England, as
the Text hath it, were he obliged to take notice of every different Lection,
quoted in the Margin? And were not ſuch Engliſh Proteſtants, obliged to
anſwer, according to the Reading, which, all things conſidered, the
Tranſlators though fitteſt, and ſecureſt to be placed in the Text
itſelf? If the Text condemne, can the margent acquit him? I haue procured to
know what divers Editions haue, and amongſt the reſt one of Baſilea Anno
1556, and not one of them all, hath in the Text, nec bonus; only the Edition of
Lovaine hath it in the margin. But you are much miſtaken, if you conceyue,
that our Argument looſes its force, though we ſhould read, nec bonus

this place, that good men are part of the Church, and therefore it is
impoſſible, that the whole Church, can be ſaied to approue, or

Which ſhewes how innocent ſhe was, from being obnoxious to that imputation,
of approving thoſe preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Which alſo appeares by the whole drift
of S. Auſtines diſcourſe; where ſtill he makes a difference betwene the
Church, and thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perſons. Beſides, when you would haue him
ſay, <hi>A good man will neither approue, nor &amp;c:</hi> by a good man, you
muſt not vnderſtand, every pious, or devout, or even holy perſon, who may
be ſubject to ſuch abuſes, as S. Auſtine ſpeaks of; ſeing you cite
him ſaying; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Multa hujuſmodi propter nonnullarum
vel ſanctarum, vel turbulentarum <pb n="755" facs="tcp:59214:392"/>perſonarum

                  <hi>Many of theſe
things for fear of ſcandalizing many holy perſons, or provoking thoſe
that are turbulent, I dare not freely diſollow:</hi> But by good men, you
muſt of neceſſity vnderſtand, ſuch as haue zeale, with knowledg,
ſuch as are of a right and ſettled true judgment, in matters belonging to
Faith, and Religion, and certainly ſuch they cannot be, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon of S.
Auguſtine, who could think, that the Church can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, any errour, or
ſuperſtition; ſeing we haue heard him ſay (Ep: 118.) <hi>If the Church
through the whole world practiſe any of theſe things, to diſpute whether
that ought to be done, is a moſt inſolent madness.</hi> Will you haue an
vnderſtanding, good man, to be guilty of moſt inſolent mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? If a
good man cannot approue ſuch things, much less, in truth, and in the opinion
of S. Auſtine, the Church could doe it. So that reade S. Auſtine as you
pleaſe, the ſentence, which <hi>Charity Maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> alledged, proves
the infallibility of Gods Church; neither can you finde any meanes to avoide
this inference, except by vnmasking yourſelf, and ſaying as you doe here
(N. 44.) <hi>To deal ingeniouſly with you and the world, I am not ſuch an
idolater of S. Auſtine, as to think a thing proved ſufficiently, becauſe
he ſaies it, or that all his ſentences ore ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> And ſo I may
returne your owne words, and ſay: <hi>But now after all this adoe, what if S.
Auſtine ſaies</hi> what <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> affirmes him to ſay,
ſeing you do not much regard what S. Auſtine ſaies?</p>
               <p n="62">62. For anſwer to your (N. 53.) I ſay that
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> had reaſon to affirme, that ſeing no private
perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ought to preſume, that they are endued with greater infallibility,
than the Church, which Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants teach to be infallible only in
Fundamentall Points, they cannot be ſure, that they attaine the true
ſenſe of Scripture, vnless they firſt know, what points in particular be
Fundamentall; becauſe in other they may erte, as they ſay the Church may.
Beſides it hath bene ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, that, in the Principles of Proteſtants, it
cannot be convinced, that Scripture is infallible, except only in fundamentall
Points, and ſo men cannot rely on Scripture, vnless firſt they be ſure,
what points be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall. Neither is there the ſame reaſon, for
vnderſtanding (not the bare words, but) the ſenſe of Scripture, intended
by the Holy Ghoſt, as there is for vnderſtanding ſom plain place in
Ariſtotle, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyving ſome evident naturall truths, which are
connaturall to humane reaſon, and are not capable of different ſenſes, as
the words of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re are. Which may be proved, even by the Examples which
you bring <pb n="756" facs="tcp:59214:393"/>as evident, as I haue ſhewed hertofore, that
they are not ſo: Neither can any Proteſtants learne them from Scripture
alone with ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, as is neceſſary to an Act of Faith, which
according to all good Chriſtians muſt be infallible, and therfore you ſay
only <hi>Proteſtants may be certain enough of the Truth and certainty</hi> of
one of the places which you alledg as evident; but your enough, is not enough,
for the abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te certainty of Divine Faith. And therfore <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> did you no wrong at all, and much less a palpable injury, as
you ſpeak, in ſaying, you cannot, with certainty, learne of Scripture,
fundamentall Points of Faith; which is manifeſt by the examples which you
ſay are <hi>Truths Fundamentall, becauſe they are neceſſary parts of
the Goſpell,</hi> and yet it is evident, that Proteſtents cannot agree
about their meaning, as I haue demonſtrated about theſe ſentences;
<hi>God is, and is a rewarder of them that ſeek him: that there is no
ſalvation but by Faith in Chriſt: That by Repentance and Faith in Chriſt
Remiſſion of ſinnes may be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: That there ſhall be a
Reſurrection of the Body.</hi> Which are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which here you
giue, as Truths both Fundamentall, and evident.</p>
               <p n="63">63. Your (N. 51.) hath bene anſwered in ſeverall
occaſions. And all that you ſay (N. 52.) is directly nothing to the
purpoſe, but paſſes from objects conſidered in themſelves (wherof
Proteſtants confess ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to be Fundamentall, others not) to accidentall
circumſtances; as if Proteſtants did differ not in Fundamentall points, or
in aſſigning a particular Catalogue of them, but only in accidentall
circumſtances, of ignorance, repentance, and the like. But of this I haue

and you know very well, that Catholik Writers haue fully anſwered all your

anſwered at large.</p>
               <p n="95">95. I deſire the Reader to peruſe the (N. 21.) of
<hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> and he will finde that you make an argument, as
his, which is nothing <pb n="757" facs="tcp:59214:393"/>like his diſcourſe. He ſaieth
not as you (N. 66.) cited him in theſe words: <hi>We may not depart from the
Church abſolutely and in all things; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not depart fram it in
any thing,</hi> which you call an Argument, à dicto ſimpliciter ad
dictum ſecundum quid. The Argument of <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> is Dr. Potter teacheth
(Pag: 75.) <hi>That there neither was nor can be any juſt cauſe to depart
from the Church of Chriſt, no more than from Chriſt himſelf:</hi> But if
the Church could erre in any points of Faith, they may and muſt forſake her
in thoſe, and if ſuch errours ſhould fall out to be concerning the
Churches Lyturgie, Sacraments &amp;c. they muſt leaue her externall
Communion, which being eſſentiall to the Church, they muſt divide
themſelves from her, in that which iseſſentiall to make one a member of
the ſame Church, which I hope is more than to argue ad dictum ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
quid. For what greater ſeparation, can there be from the Church, than in that
which is eſſentiall to make one be vnited to her? Your ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a
man may leaue the vice of his friend, or brother, and yet not leaue his friend,
or brother, is impertinent, ſeing vices are not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to men, as
externall Communion is, to make one a member of the Church.</p>
               <p n="66">66. You object; <hi>what Dr. Potter ſaieth of the
Catholique Church</hi> (P. 75.) <hi>he extends preſently after, to euery
true, though never ſo corrupted part of it. And why do you not conclude from
hence, that no particular Church (according to his judgement) can fall into any
ertour and call this a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="67">67. Anſwer: If the Doctour will not contradict
himſelf; according to his judgment, the Catholique Church cannot fall into
errour againſt any Truth neceſſary to ſalvation, as a particular Church
may, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore this, may, but that, can never be forſaken: or if he will
affirme, that no particular Church can be forſaken; he muſt ſay, that no
ſuch Church can erre in any point neceſſary to ſalvation. For if ſhe
did ſo erre, her Communion muſt be forſaken, and I haue ſhewed
externall Communion, to be eſſentiall to the members of the Church. Whereby
is anſwered your (N. 67.) where you grant that <hi>we may not ceaſe to be
of the Church, nor forſake it abſolutely and totally no more than Chriſt
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi> Since therefore they abſolutely forſake the Church, who
diſagree from Her in profeſſion of Faith, and divide themſelves from
her exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Communion, you muſt grant, that they can no more doe ſo,
than they can divide themſelves from Chriſt. I know not, to what purpoſe,
or vpon what occaſion, you ſay to <hi>Ch: Ma: In other places, you confes 
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:59214:394"/>his doctrine to be, that even the Catholique Church may
erre in Points not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, which you do not pretend that he ever imputed
to Chriſt himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="68">68. Your manner of alledging the words of <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> in your (N. 68.) gives me ſtill, occaſion to wiſh you had
alledged them, as you found them. You make <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſpeak
thus: Dr. Potter <hi>either contradicts himſelf, or els muſt grant the
Church infallible; becauſe he ſaies, if we did not differ from the Roman,
we could not agree with the Catholique, which ſaying ſuppoſes the
Catholique Church cannot erre.</hi> And then you ſay with your vſuall
modeſty: <hi>This Argument to giue it the right name, is an obſcure and
intriate nothing.</hi> I confess that reading the words, which you impute to
<hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> I found difficulty to penetrate the force of his
Argument. But the words of <hi>Charity Main:</hi> are theſe. If, ſaith Dr.
Potter, <hi>we did not diſſent in ſome opinions from the preſent Roman
Church, we could not agree with the Church truly Catholi<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>. Theſe words
cannot be true, vnless he preſuppoſes that the Church truly Catholique,
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre in Points not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall. For if ſhe may erre in ſuch points,
the Roman Church which he affirmes to erre only in points not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall, may
agree with the Church truly Catholi<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>, if ſhe likewiſe may erre in
points not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall.</hi> This is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> and is
it not cleare, that if the Church Catholique can erre, for example, in the
Doctrines of Purgatory, Invocations of Saynts, reall preſence, and the like,
as de facto Luther and his followers pretend ſhe did erre, and that they were
reformers of ſuch errours, ſeing the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church may, and doth hold the
ſame Doctrines, the Church vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall and the Roman Church ſhall agree
in the ſame (pretended) er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and ſo Potter ſaied not truly, that if
we agree with the Roman Church, (for example about Purgatory, Praiers, to
ſaynts &amp;c:) we cannot agree with the Church Catholique? Will you deny the
Axiom; Quae ſunt eadem vni tertio ſunt eadem inter ſe? If then the
vniverſall, and the Roman Church agree in the belief, of errours (as you
falſly terme them) do they not agree one with an other? And ſo, contrary to
Potters affirmation it muſt be ſaied; If we did diſſent from theſe
opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the preſent Roman Church, we could not agree with the Church
Catholique, if once it be ſuppoſed, that the Church holds thoſe, or the
like vnfundamentall errours, as you grant ſhe may; And further it would
follow, that ſeing Proteſtants diſſent from the Roman Church, they
cannot agree with the Catholique Church. But let vs heare how you make good
your cenſure.</p>
               <p n="69">69. You ſay; <hi>let vs ſuppoſe, either that the
Catholique Church may erre <pb n="759" facs="tcp:59214:394"/>but doth not, but that the
Roman actually doth; or that the Catholique Church may erre, in ſome few
things, but that the Roman errs in many more, And is it not apparent in both
theſe caſes (which yet both ſuppoſe the Churches infallibility) a man
may truly ſaie, vnless I diſſent in ſome opinions from the Roman
Church, I cannot agree with the Catholique? Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therfore you muſt retract
your imputation laied vpon Dr. Potter, or doe that which you condemne in him,
and be driven to ſay, that the ſame man may held ſome errours with the
Church of Rome, and at the ſame tyme with the Catholique Church not hold but
condemne them. For otherwiſe in neither of theſe caſes it is posſible
for the ſame man at the ſame tyme, to agree with the Roman and the
Catholique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="70">70. Anſwer, Your conſcience cannot but witness, that
the Doctor when he ſaied: <hi>If we did not diſſent in ſome opinions
from the preſent Roman Church, we could not agree with the Church truly
Cathelique,</hi> did not ſpeak of accidentall caſes, or voluntary
ſuppoſitions, ſuch as you put; but meant and ſpoke abſolutely, that
if we did not diſſent from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Roman Church, we could not agree
with the Church truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. For if he meant only of contingent caſes,
without regard to any particular advantage, or prerogatiue of the Church
vniverſall, he might haue made ſuppoſitions, directly contrary to yours;
that the Roman Church may erre, but doth not, but the vniverſall actually
doth; or that the Roman Church doth erre in ſome few things, but the
Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que errs in many more. For if once it be granted the Catholique Church
to erre; to ſay ſhe may erre in many, or few, is a voluntary, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded,
conjecture, or divination, and nothing to any purpoſe. Nay ſeing, if once
the Catholik Church be ſuppoſed to erre, ſhe may multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply errours
without end, and ſo, to day agree with, to morrow diſagree, from the Roman
Church, and it muſt follow, that according to your explication, the Doctours
words may be in a perpetuall alteration, to day fals, to morrow true; which
either was farre from his meaning, or his meaning was not only impertinent, but
againſt his owne ſcope and Intention, which was to make the vniverſall
Church as it were the Modell or Rule to judge of the neceſſity, which
Proteſtants had to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Roman Church, by reaſon of her
diſſenting from the Church Catholiques which had bene no good reaſon, if
the vniverſall Church may erre, and erre as much and more, than the Roman, or
any other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioular Church. Which appeares alſo by theſe words of the
Doctor in the ſame (Pag: 97.) <hi>The Catholique Church is carefull to ground
all her declarations <pb n="760" facs="tcp:59214:395"/>vpon the divine Authority of Gods
written word. And therfore whoſoever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully oppoſed a judgement ſo
well grounded, is juſtly eſteemed an Heretique.</hi> And (P: 132.) he
ſaieth: <hi>For vs: the miſtaker (nor his he Maſters) will never prove,
that we oppoſe either any declaration of the Catholique Church, or any
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall or other truth of Scripture, and therefore he doth vnjuſtly
charge vs with Schiſme or Heriſie.</hi> Do not theſe ſayings, attribute
more to the vniverſall, than to particular Churches; and more than a meerely
caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, that either ſhe doth not actually erre, or els erres in fewer
things, than the preſent Roman Church? And vpon the whole matter, is not that
true, which <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> (N. 22.) ſaied, That D. Potter muſt
either grant, that the Catholique Church cannot erre in Points not
Fundamentall, or confess a plain contradiction to himſelf in the ſaied
words: <hi>If we did not diſſent in ſome opinions from the preſent
Roman Church, we could not agree with the Church truly Catholique?</hi> Would
not Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants take it in ill parte, if one ſhould ſay: If we did not
diſſent in ſome opinions from Proteſtants, we could not agree with the
Church truly Catholique? And yet according to your explication, and
ſuppoſitions, it could not be ill taken, becauſe either the Church might
be ſuppoſed not to erre actually or in ſome few things, but that the
Proteſtants erre in many more, it being manifeſt that ſome of them erre.
By the way, when Potter ſaieth: <hi>(For vs: the Miſtaker will never proue
that we oppoſe any Declaration of the Catholique Church, or any truth of
Scripture)</hi> I would know, whom he vnderſtand by, vs? Seing it is evident,
that of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, holding ſo many contrary Doctrines, ſome muſt of
neceſſity, oppoſe ſome Declaration of the Church, or truth of
Scripture: and ſince they haue no certaine Rule to know, which of them be in
the wrong, and oppoſe ſome Declaration of the Church, or Scripture, we
muſt conclude, that no man deſirous of his ſalvation, can commit his
ſoule to any of them all. Your Concluſion (Either therefore you muſt
retract your imputation laid vpon Dr Potter, or doe that &amp;c.) is obſcure;
but I am ſure it is anſwered, ſeing it goes vpon your fals explication of
the Doctors words.</p>
               <p n="71">71. Your proceding (N. 69.) puts me vpon a neceſſity,
of intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Reader, to peruſe the (N. 23.) of <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrates, that it was wholy impertinent,
for you to anſwer the places, which He ſaieth, are wont to be all edged out
of Scripture for the infallibility of Gods Church; and your labour, and paines
taken therin, are loſt in order to any other effect, except (contrary to your
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires) <pb n="761" facs="tcp:59214:395"/>to ſtregthen the ſaying of <hi>Charity
Maintayned,</hi> which was; That our very difference about the meaning of
theſe Texts, ſhewes the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of agreement in matters of Faith
by Scripture alone. To which purpoſe He ſetts downe, what ſenſe
Catholiques giue them, and the different interpretation of Proteſtants, from
Catholikes, and from one and other. While therfore, you profess to confute the
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Catholikes (but indeed impugne alſo that of moſt
Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and of Dr. Potter in particular) what doe you els, but make
good the ſaied Affirmation, and intention, and proofe of <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi>
that Scripture alone is not ſufficient to interpret it ſelf? And you could
not but ſee, that <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> did not alledg any Text, to
proue the Churches infallibility, but only to ſhew the difficulty of
Scripture ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alone, by thoſe examples, which he alledges, and
Proteſtants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret in a different ſenſe from Catholiques, and in
which you differ from both. So that, even by your diſagreeing from
Catholiques, in the meaning of thoſe places, you in fact, and Deeds, proue
the truth of that which your adverſary affirmed: and the more you object
againſt <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> the more you prejudice yourſelf, and
make good theſe his words: <hi>If words cannot perſwade you, that in all
controuerſies you muſt rely vpon the infallibility of the Church; at
leaſt yeald your aſſent to Deeds.</hi> Which thing conſidered, I haue
no obligation at all, to examine your Objections, againſt the interpretation
of thoſe Texts in favour of the Churches infallibility, for which purpoſe
they were not produced by <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> but only to proue, by an
Argument drawen from Experience, and Deeds, or matter of fact, that there
muſt be ſome Living Guide, to interpret Scripture; and you were wiſe
enough, not to take notice of this Argument, which was evident by experience,
but diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the matter, and divert the Reader, with diſcourſes no
less repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Proteſtants, than Catholiks; and therefore your
interpretations proue nothing, becauſe they proue too much, even in the
common grounds, and tenets of Proteſtants. Nevertheless, by way of
ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, I will, examine all that you can object.</p>
               <p n="72">72. (N. 69.) you bring certaine objections, in a
different letter, as if they were made eypreſſly by <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> and
yet I finde them not in him, whatſoever they be in themſelves. Then, (N.
70.) you ſay; <hi>The Church may erre and yet the gates of Hell not privaile
againſt her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="73">73. Anſwer; you know we deny this, and in diverſe
occaſions haue given good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sfor our denyall. And what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be more
inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, with <pb n="762" facs="tcp:59214:396"/>being of a true Church, than
errour againſt Faith, which Faith is the moſt eſſentiall
conſtitutiue, of the Church, or congregation of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people. Yourſelf
teach, that every errour repugnant to Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, is damnable of
itſelf; and what can ſet the gates of Hell more open, than damnable
ſinnes? Neither can you flie to ignorance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue no
certainty, eſpecially for the whole vniverſall Church, and yet we are
certaine by our Saviours Promiſe, that the gates of Hell, cannot prevaile
againſt her; whereof we could not be certaine, if the Church may erre
damnably, and be excuſed only by ignorance, which, as I ſaied, is an
vncertaine hidden thing. Beſide, The Church being appointed, by our Saviour
Chriſt, to be the teacher of all Chriſtians, it is eſſentially
neceſſary, that ſhe cannot erre, even by ignorance, but muſt be
believed to be infallible, in all matters, belonging to Faith; ſeing
otherwiſe we cannot belieue her with certainty in any point, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
or not fundamentall, as you confess, in this Chapt. (N. 36.) that vnless the
Church be infallible in all things we cannot <hi>rationally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue her for
her owne ſake, and vpon her owne word and Authority in any thing. For an
authority ſubject to errour can be no firme or ſtable founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my
belief in any thing.</hi> Now that the office of the Church is to teach all
Chriſtians, you teach, (Pag. 119. N. 164.) in theſe words: <hi>Though the
viſible Church ſhall alwaies, without faile propoſe ſo much of Gods
Revelation, as is ſufficient to bring men to heaven; for otherwiſe it will
not be the viſible Church, yet it may ſometimes ad to this Revelation
things ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, nay gurtfull, nay in themſelves damnable.</hi> And in
this Chapter (N. 78.) you ſay: <hi>That the true Church alwaies ſhall be
the maintainer and Teacher of all neceſſary truths, you know we grant, and
muſt grant; for it is the Eſſence of the Church to be ſo, and any
company of men were no more a Church without it, then any thing can be a man,
and not be reaſonable. But as a man may be ſtill a man, though he want a
hand or an eye, which yet are profitable parts, ſo the Church may be ſtill
a Church, though it be defectiue in ſome profitable truth. And as a man may
be a man, that has ſome biles, and botches on his body; ſo the Church may
be the Church, though it haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corruptions both in Doctrine and
practice.</hi> Out of theſe ſayings of yours, this argument offers it
ſelf: <hi>The Church is eſſentially a Teacher of all neceſſary
truths</hi> (And conſequently we are to belieue her in ſuch points;) But
the Church cannot be believed in neceſſary points, vnless we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue her
to be infallible, in all that ſhe propoſes as matter of Faith: This alſo
is our Doctrine; Therefore we muſt belieue her to be infallible in 
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:59214:396"/>all points: So that in denying the vniverſall
infallibility of the Church, you contradict both truth, and your owne
Aſſertions.</p>
               <p n="74">74. And heere I muſt put you in minde, of your
ſaying, that there is difference betweene being infallible in Fundamentalls,
and an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llible Guide in Fundamentalls, and yet we haue heard you ſay,
that the Church is an infallible Teacher of ſo much as is neceſſary for
ſalvation, and what is to be an infallible Teacher, or Propoſer, but to be
an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Guide? And then further, ſeing you ſay (P. 105. N. 139.)
<hi>To make any Church an: infallible Guide in Fundamentalls, would be to make
it infallible in all things, which ſhe propoſes and requires to be
believed;</hi> we muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily infer, that de facto, the Church
which is an infallible Teacher, and Guide, <hi>is infallible in all things
which ſhe propoſes and requires to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="75">75. This is not all that I am to deduce, from your
ſaied Aſſertions. You ſay in this ſame Page and Number: <hi>No Church
can posſibly be fit to be a Guide, but only a Church of ſome certaine
Denomination:</hi> To which Propoſition, I ſubſume; But we haue heard you
ſay that it is of <hi>the eſſence of the Church to be a Teacher of all
neceſſary Truths, and that ſhe ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes without faile propoſe
ſo much as is ſufficient to bring men to</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Therfore you muſt
grant, that there is ſome infallible Church of one denomination; which is the
direct contradictory of your Title to this Chapter. Moreover; how do theſe
things agree with your ſaying heere (N. 78.) <hi>If we grant that the
Apoſtle calls the Catholique Church the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ground of Truth, and that
not only becauſe it ſhould, but becauſe it alwayes ſhall and will be
ſo, yet after all this you haue done nothing, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you, can ſhew that by
Truth heere is certainly ment, not only all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, but
all that is profitable, abſolutely and ſimply All.</hi> How, I ſay, doth
this agree with your ſaying now cited out of your (Pag: 105. N. 139.) <hi>To
make any Church an infallible guide in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, would be to make it
Infallible in all things, which ſhe propoſes and requires to be
believed;</hi> ſeing you ſay alſo, that although it were granted that S.
Paule affirmed, that the Church ſhall, and will, be the Pillar of all
neceſſary truth, yet it doth not follow, that ſhe is ſo in all Truth?
And now, how many cluſtars, as I may ſay, of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, may be
gathered from your owne words, related by me, in this ſmall compass?</p>
               <p n="76">76. Firſt; The Church is an infallible Teacher in
Fundamentalls, and yet is not an infallible guide; or if you grant her to be an
infallible <pb n="764" facs="tcp:59214:397"/>Guide; then Secondly; you ſay; <hi>to make
any Church an infallible Guide in Fundamentalls, would be to make it infallible
in all things, which ſhe propoſes, and requires to be believed;</hi> and
yet you ſay the Church is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Teacher or guide in all
Fundamentalls, and deny her to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all things, which ſhe
propoſes, and requires to be believed. Thirdly; How can you make a
diſtinction, between the Churches being infallible in Fundamentalls, and an
infallible Guide in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, ſeing you teach that ſhe is both
infallible in Fundamentalls, and a Teacher of them? Fourthly. How doe you
ſay? That to be a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acher of all neceſſary truth is <hi>the Eſſence
of the Church and that any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men were no more a Church without it,
then any thing can be a man, and not be reaſonable.</hi> And yet in this
Chapter (N. 39.) to proue, that there is a wide difference betweene being
infallible in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, and an infallible Guide in Fundamentalls, you
ſay; <hi>A man that were deſtitute of all meanes of communicating his
thoughts to others, might yet in himſelf be infallible, but he could not be a
Guide to others. A man or a Church that were inviſible, ſo that none could
know how to repaire to it for direction, could not be an infallible Guide, and
yet he might be in himſelf infallible?</hi> For, theſe examples, if they be
to any purpoſe, declare, that to be a Guide, or Teacher, is accidentall, and
not the Eſſence of the Church (and for that purpoſe you bring them) and
yet I never imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the Eſſence of any thing is ſeparable from
it, as you ſay it is impoſſible a thing can be a man, and not be
reaſonable. Fiftly; If it be eſſentiall to the Church to be an infallible
Teacher, or Guide in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, which you ſay ſhe cannot be, without an
vniverſall infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in all Points, ſeing every errour deſtroyes
that vniverſall infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which is eſſentiall to ſuch a Teacher
as the Church, how can you ſay, that every errour doth not deſtroy the
Church, but that ſhe may erre, and yet the gates of hell not prevaile
againſt her? To what purpoſe then, do you talk of eyes, and hands, which
are not eſſentiall or neceſſary parts of a man; or of biles and
botches, which are acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to his body, and not neceſſaryly
deſtructiue thereof, as you muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; wheras infallibility is
eſſentiall to the Church of Chriſt, and is deſtroyed by errour, which
cannot poſſibly conſiſt with infallibility, that is, with certainty
never to erre. Into how may inextricable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and contradictions do
you caſt yourſelf, vpon a reſolution, not to acknowledg the infallibility
of Gods Church, the only meanes to cleare all theſe perplexityes? And how
inconſequently, and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, <pb n="765" facs="tcp:59214:397"/>and you compare
botches and biles, to errour againſt Faith, which you confess to be damnable
ſinnes, and without repentance abſolutely inconſiſtent with
ſalvation?</p>
               <p n="77">77. But to returne to the maine point. If the Church were
not vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally infallible, Chriſtian Faith could not be infallible, as I
proved hertofore, and ſo the gates of Hell, ſhould prevaile againſt
Chriſtianity, which by that meanes, ſhould come to want, a thing
abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, neceſſitate medij, to witt,
divine infallible Faith. Your Parity betweene a particular man, or
congregation, and the vniverſall Church, hath bene anſwered hertofore; and
is confuted, by what we haue ſaied heere; that infallibility is
eſſentiall to the vniverſall Church; and nothing can exiſt without that
which is eſſentiall to it, but no ſuch Priviledge of infallibility, is
neceſſary, or is promiſed to particular men, or Churches. Finally,
ſeing that according to Potter, and other Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, the Promiſe of
our Saviour, that the gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againſt the Church,
muſt be vnderſtood of the whole Church, as well Primitiue, as of
conſequent Ages; by what evident Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can you proue, that the
ſame words, muſt haue different ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, in order to the
Primitiue Church (which was infallible in all Points of Faith) and the
vniverſall Church of following Ages? As in a like occaſion I ſaied
hertofore. Yourſelf (N. 72.) ſpeak to <hi>Charity Maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> thus:
<hi>vnless you will ſay, which is moſt ridiculous, that when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſaied, He will teach you &amp;c: and he will ſhew you &amp;c: He meant one
you in the former clauſe, and an other you in the latter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> If it be
moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, that one word ſhould be referred to different Perſons,
I may ſay ad hominem, why ought it not to ſeeme moſt ridiculous, that in
the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſentence, the ſame words, the gates of Hell ſhall not
privaile, muſt ſignify two differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t kinds, of not prevailing (one
againſt fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d an other againſt vnfundamentall errours) in order
to one, and the ſame word, Church?</p>
               <p n="78">78. In your (N. 71.) you pretend to anſwer the Text
which <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> ſaieth may be alledged for the infallibility of the
Church, out S. Jo: (14. V. 16.17.) <hi>I will ask the Father, and he will give
you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever, the ſpirit of
truth.</hi> And Jo: (16.13.) <hi>but when he, the Spirit of truth commeth, he
ſhall teach you all truth.</hi> You anſwer, firſt; that one may fall into
error, if this all truth be <hi>not ſimply all, but all of ſome kind.
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> that <hi>one may fall into ſome error, even contrary to the
truth which is taught him, if it be taught him only ſufficiently, and not
irreſiſtibly, ſo that be may learne <pb n="766" facs="tcp:59214:398"/>it if he will
not, ſo that he muſt and ſhall, whether be will or no. Now who can
aſſertaine me, that the Spirits teaching is not of this nature? Or how can
you poſsibly reconcile it with your Doctrine of free will in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving?
Thirdly</hi> you ſay (N. 72.) <hi>that theſe promiſes were made to the
Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="79">79. Anſwer; Theſe places were alledged by Dr. Potter,
to proue that the Church cannot erre, againſt any Fundamentall Truth. Which
limitation I haue confuted already, and joyntly your firſt Anſwer. Your
Second, and Third are directly againſt the Doctor, who (Pag: 151.) te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches
that the <hi>Promiſes which our Lord hath made vnto his Church for his
aſsiſtance, are intended to the Church Catholique, and they are to be
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to Points Fundamentall.</hi> And then he alledges the ſaied
text (Joan: 16.13. And Chap: 41.61.) adding, that, <hi>Though that Promiſe
was direstly and primarily made to the Apoſtles, yet it was made to them for
the behoof of the Church, and is verifyed in the Church vniverſall.</hi> Now
if the Church cannot erre fundamentally, ſhe is taught by the holy Ghoſt,
not only ſufficiently, but effectually. And if thoſe Promiſes were made
to the Apoſtles, not only primarily as Potter affirmes, but to them only, as
you ſay, how could the Doctor proue by them the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Church
for all Fundamentalls? Can a Text of Scripture proue that to which it nothing
belongs? As well, by this Text, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as you doe, he might haue proved
you, or himſelf, or any other infallible in Fundamentall Points! So that now
I muſt defend the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor againſt <hi>Mr. Chill.,</hi> who among all
Engliſh Proteſtants, was picked out as a fit champion, to maintayne the
cauſe of Proteſtants, and defend Potters Booke. You are greatly miſtaken,
and offend againſt the knowen Rule which Logicians give for Diviſion, while
you ſay, one may be taught only ſufficiently, and not irreſiſtibly, as
if theſe, were adequately the membra dividentia, of being taught; whereas one
may be taught effectually, and neither ſufficiently only, nor yet
irreſiſtibly, as hath bene declared more than once. Do not yourſelf tell
vs heere, that the ſaied Promiſes were made to the Apoſtles only? Who I
hope you will ſay, were taught effectually, and not ſufficiently only:
Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we cannot be ſure but that de facto, they deviated from the
direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo we can haue no certainty, that their
wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are infallible. Or if the doctrine of freewill, which you Socinians
alſo defend, can conſiſt with the infallibility of the Apoſtles, how
can it be inconſiſtent with freewill in the Church? You ſay: <hi>The word
in the <pb n="767" facs="tcp:59214:398"/>Originall is</hi> hodegeſei <hi>which
ſignifyes to be a guide, and director only, not to compell or
neceſsitate.</hi> But what is this to any purpoſe againſt vs, who teach
nothing againſt Freewill by our Doctrine of the infallible aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Holy Ghoſt? And yet I muſt ſay, that you vſe fraude, by writing
ſo, as if the word did ſignify a guide or director only, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of being neceſſitated, whereas the Greeke word is verified, whether one be
a guide or director, reſiſtibly, or irreſiſtibly. For in both caſes,
he is a guide: and ſo Cornelius à Lapide interprets it, ducet
rectâ viâ ad virtutem, quaſi dux viae, which one may doe, either
by leading, and leaving one to his liberty to follow, or by forcing him to
followe his guidance: and ſo the places which you alledg out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of men that had eyes to ſee and would not ſee, are to no purpoſe, except
to ingage you, to anſwer them in caſe of the Apoſtles, whom, I
ſuppoſe, you will not deny, to haue bene ſecured from errour, both
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, and effectually. Yea you take much (vnprofitable) paines to
proue, that the ſaied Texts were by our Saviour meant only of the
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, by reaſon of circumſtances, which appropriate them to his
Diſciples.</p>
               <p n="80">80. But Dr. Potter hath told you, that <hi>Though that
promiſe directly and primarily was made to the Apoſtles, yet it was made to
them in behoof of the Church, and is verified in the Church vniverſall.</hi>
For we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the Apoſtles, a double capacity: either as they are
private, and particular Perſons; or as they reſpect, and repreſent, or
beare the place of the Church, and for her good receiue ſome Power or
priviledg, and not meerely with relation to their owne perſons. And
therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome words in the places which you alledge, be referred
to the Apoſtles only, yet it does not follow, that all muſt be reſtrained
to them: Otherwiſe you will deſtroy the whole Church of Chriſt, and all
Chriſtianity. Nothing is more neceſſary in Chriſtian Religion, than
Preaching to all Nations, and Baptizing, which our Saviour injoyned (Matth. 28.
Mark 16. Luke 24.) yet, by your manner of arguing, it may be proved that they
concerned the Apoſtles only. For it is ſaied, (Mark 16.14.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Laſt he appeared to thoſe Eleven as
they ſate at the table, and he exprobrated their incrudelity, and hardness of
hart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not belieue them that had ſeene him riſen againe:
And (N. 15.16.) he ſaied to them, Going into the world preach the Ghoſpell
to all Creatures, He that believes and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</q>
Heere you ſee, that although ſome circumſtances be proper to the
Apoſtles, as ſitting at table, and incrudelity, yet it does not follow, 
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:59214:399"/>that all muſt concerne them only; as, that preaching,
and baptizing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the whole Church, I imagine you will not deny. In
the ſame manner, (Matth. 28. N. 16.17.18.19.20.) divers things are
ſpecified, which belong to the Apoſtles only, (as going into Galilee,
adoring, doubting, and our Saviours ſpeaking to them) and yet his command, 
<q rend="margQuotes">(Going, teach ye all Nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt)</q>
belongs to the whole Church. The like Argument may be taken out of S. Luke
(Cap. 24. N. 44.45.46.47.48.49.) where ſome thing is perſonall to the
Apoſtles, and we muſt not ſay, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that pennance to be preached in his
name, and remiſſion of ſinnes vnto all Nations</q> (as is ſayd N. 47.)
belonged to the Apoſtles only, though it be expreſly ſaied, beginning
from Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, which ſeemes proper to the Perſons of the Apoſtles,
and yet Preaching Pennance (a thing common to the whole Church) is ſet downe
in the ſame verſe with (beginning from Hieruſalem,) which was perſonall
to the Apoſtles. Thus, (Joan. 20.) Some particulars are ſpoken, and done to
the Apoſtles only; as (N. 21.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">He ſaied to them againe: Peace be to
you;</q> and (N. 22.) He breathed vpon them; and yet (N. 23.) he gives them
Power to forgiue ſinnes; which Power did not ceaſe with the Death of the
Apoſtles. Theſe inſtances ſhew, that you muſt anſwer your owne
Objections, and will force you to confess, that it is no good way of arguing,
that all things in the Texts, which <hi>Ch. Ma:,</hi> and Dr. Potter, alledg
out of S. John, for the infallibility of the Church, muſt be appropriated to
the Apoſtles, for the ſubſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome circumſtances
concerne them alone; and that we muſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſtinguiſh, betwene
thoſe two kinds of things; as certainly not to be led into any errour
againſt Faith, is moſt neceſſary for the Church, which God hath
appointed for Teacher of all Chriſtians, and Judge of controverſies. And
that the Apoſtles may be, and are, ſometyme conſidered as publike
perſons, and with relation to the Church, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, out of S. Matth. (Cap.
28.) where ſome things belong to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles only, (as going into Galilee
&amp;c.) and other to the Church in them, or to them in the Church, as
(beſide Teaching and Baptizing N. 19.) <hi>Behold I am with you all dayes,
even to the conſummation of the world,</hi> which ſignifyes, that he would
be with them in their Succeſſours, who were to continue for all Ages after
the death of the Apoſtles, with whom he could not be preſent in
themſelves, to the conſummation of the world, who were not to liue to the
worlds end; as you ſay heere; <hi>Did he, or could <pb n="769" facs="tcp:59214:399"/>he
haue ſaied to your Church, which then was not extant, I haue many things to
ſay vnto you, but you cannot beare them now?</hi> So we may apply the like
words; Did he, or could he ſay to his Apoſtles, I will be with you to the
worlds end, when they were not to be extant? But the truth is, when our Saviour
ſpoke to his Apoſtles, our Church was then extant, in the Apoſtles; and
the Apoſtles were to liue to the worlds end, in their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, and
ſo our Saviours promiſe is fulfilled, of being alwaies with the Apoſtles
in their Succeſſours.</p>
               <p n="81">81. You object to <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> that
<hi>In the very text by him alledged, there are things promiſed which your
Church cannot with any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty pretend to. For there it is ſaied, the
Spirit of Truth not only will gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ide you into all Truth, but alſo will ſhew
you things to come.</hi> But this is anſwered by what hath bene ſaied
already. Though it were granted, that ſome thing was promiſed to the
Apoſtles alone, it doth not follow, that the whole promiſe was ſo
reſtrained as I haue ſhewed aboue. Beſides, Chriſtian Faith teaches vs
many things to come; as the comming of Antichriſt; the generall judgement,
and ſignes precedent to it; The Reſurrection of the dead; The eternall
puniſhment of the wicked, and reward of the juſt &amp;c: For this cauſe
S. Anſelm (apud Cornelium a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide in 4. Epheſ: N. 11.) teaches, that by
Prophets in that Text are vnderſtood interpreters of Scriptures, becauſe 
<q rend="margQuotes">per eas futura juſtorum gaudia,
malorumque ſupplicia hominibus praenunciant.</q> If by ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing things to
come, you vnderſtand the Gift of Prophecy; Do you hold it as certaine that
every one of the Apoſtles had that Gift, as that they were infallible in
matters of Faith? Are you certaine, that every Apoſtle, could haue written
the Apocalyps of S. John? So that indeed if you will needs haue a full parity,
between being led into all Truth, and knowing of things to come, you will be
found, not to be certaine that the Apoſtles were infallible in matters of
Faith. Morover, it is to be obſerved, that to be infallible was
eſſentiall to the office of Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, or teaching the Church, as the
Gift of Prophecy is accidentall, and was communicated to others, as we read in
the Acts; as alſo it was accidentall to ſpeak all toungs, to haue bene
called immediatly by our Saviour (as S. Matthias was not, and yet was an
Apoſtle) to haue inflicted Cenſure of Excommunication, with ſome
viſible puniſhment, and the like extraordinary ornaments, or Priviledgs:
And therfore no wonder, if infallibility in matters of Faith be communicated to
the Church, though the knowledg of things to come, were not: though 
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:59214:400"/>indeed de facto, God hath, and ever will, communicate the
Gift of Prophecy, to his Church, as is certaine by the vndoubted Authority of
the beſt writers of all Ages. You ſee now, that neither <hi>Charity
Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned,</hi> nor other Catholique writers, cite the ſaied text by
halfes, as you affirme (N. 72.) ſeing the latter clauſe (of ſhewing
things to come) makes nothing againſt them, nor alters the ſenſe of the
text, as I haue ſhewed. But now good Sr. I beſeech you reflect, whom you
impugne, while you would perſwade men, that <hi>Charity Maintayned, and
generally our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of controverſies, when they entreate of this Argument,
cite this text perpetually by hafes:</hi> ſeing Dr. Potter (Pag: 151.) cites
this very ſame place and (leaves out thoſe words will ſhew you things to
come) for which you accuſe vs of citing that ſentence by halfes:
eſpecially if you call to mynd, that he brings that text to proue, that the
Church cannot faile in Fundamentall points, which as I ſaied were no proofe,
if it were me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of the Apoſtles only, as you would proue it was, by the
words, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Doctor no less than by <hi>C: Ma:</hi> (he will ſhew
you things to come.) To all which I add; that ſeing you ſay, that text
concerned the Apoſtles only, it muſt ſignify an infallibility both in
Fundamentall, and vnfundamentall Points, and therfore ſeing the Doctor
confeſſes it to be verifyed in the vniverſall Church, ſhe muſt be
infallible in all Points. But it is no wonder that you contradict your Client
Potter ſince you ſo perpetually contradict yourſelf.</p>
               <p n="82">82. In your (N. 71.) you ſeeke to divert me to the
controverſyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout publique ſervice in an vnknowne tongue, and communion
vnder both kinds. But you know, Catholique Writers haue anſwered, all that
can be objected againſt vs, in theſe two queſtoins; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you
can alledg, if it were of any moment, as it cannot be, it could only ſhew,
that Scripture, even in that which to you ſeemes ſo plain, is indeed
obſcure, ſeing ſo many learned, holy, and laborious men, ſee no ſuch
evidence, as you pretend; yea they are certaine, that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended cleare
interpretation, is an Hereſie, Yet becauſe you alledge againſt vs without
any cauſe a greeke word <hi>edoke,</hi> I muſt not omitt to tell you with
truth, that Proteſtants in this Point of the Sacrament, ſhamefully
falſify the Greeke Text, (1. Cor. 11. V. 27.) ſaying in their
Tranſlation; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Whoſoever ſhall eate this bread,
and drinke this cup of the Lord vnworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and
Bloud of the Lord:</q> wheras the Greeke word ſignifyes vel, or: and ſo you
ſhould ſay; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Whoſoever ſhall eate this bread, Or
drinke the cup &amp;c. </q>which fraud <pb n="771" facs="tcp:59214:400"/>you vſe, to
proue the neceſſity of Communion in both kindes.</p>
               <p n="83">83. Your (N. 73.74.) containe no difficulty, which hath
not bene anſwered. Only I may note, that you put ſome Objection in a
different letter, which in <hi>Cha. Ma.</hi> I find not. The Promiſe, that
the Holy Ghoſt was to remaine, with the Apoſtles for ever, was not
reſtrained to, yet is verifyed in them, becauſe they remaine for ever in
their ſucceſſours, as you will ſay, they remaine in their Writings.
Your friged interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ever, that is, for the time of their lives, is
confuted by what hath bene cited, out of S. Matthew (Chap. 28.20.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">I am with you all daies, even to the
conſummation of the world;</q> And ſurely, the end of the world,
ſignifyes a larger extent, than the end of their lives, Nay, you are not
content with limiting all Promiſes made to them, to the tearme of their life,
but it ſeemes you make it not abſolute, but only conditionall, even for
that ſhort tyme. For you ſay, <hi>The ſpirit would abide with them, if
they kept their ſtation, vnto the very end of their lives.</hi> Behold an
(if) a condition, If they kept their ſtation, which, if it be in their free
will not to doe (as your, if, ſuppoſes it to be) then according to your
Divinity, they might faile, and all Promiſe, made to them proue ineffectuall:
neither can we be certaine, that de facto, they haue not failed, and fallen
into errour, in their preaching, and writing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nay, do you not teach,
and labour to proue, that the Apoſtles (even after the receiving of the Holy
Spirit which you confess was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to abide with them for ever, that is,
ſay you, for their whole life, and that <hi>they ſhould never want the
ſpirits aſsiſtance, vnto the very end of their lives,</hi>) did erre in a
command clearely revealed to them, about preaching the Goſpell to Gentills?
How then was that Promiſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if it were abſolute? And if only
conditionall; you grant no more to them than to any other; neither can we be
certaine, that they haue not erred in other things, as you ſay, they erred in
that. Your alledging ſome Texts, to proue, that the word (ever) may be taken
for the whole time of a mans life, is not to any purpoſe, vnless you had
alſo proved, that it is ſo vnderſtood, in the place of which we ſpeak.
(Joan 14.16.) And ſeing even by this example, the ſame words are capable of
different ſenſes, and that Proteſtants cannot poſſibly giue any Rule,
which Text is to be interpreted by what others, we muſt conclude, that
Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, cannot be a perfect Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p n="84">84. But now, in your (N. 75.) we find threates, that you
will work wonders, and that we may not be ſo much overſeene, as to pass
them <pb n="772" facs="tcp:59214:401"/>without due reflection, you ſay to <hi>Charity
Maintayned; This will ſeeme ſtrang newes to you at firſt hearing, and not
farre from a prodigy.</hi> But it is not ſtrang, that heere you doe that,
which you doe in divers other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that is, impeach the infallibility
of the Apoſtles, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, depriue their preaching, and writing,
and all Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of all certainty; though I grant it to be very
ſtrang and a prodigy, that, notwithſtanding this, you will pretend to be a
Chriſtian, and that your Book is approved by, and publiſhed, among,
Chriſtians. For, beſides what I noted even now, about your conditionall
promiſe made to the Apoſtles, If they kept theyr ſtation; heere you
declare cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arely, and at large; that the Promiſe of which S. John ſpeakes,
was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Apoſtles (as you ſpeak) and that, it is not
abſolute, but as you expreſſly ſay, <hi>moſt clearly and expressly
conditionall; being both in the words before reſtrained to thoſe only, that
loue God and keepe his commandements: And in the words after flatly denyed to
all whom the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtile by the name of the world, that is, as the
very Antitheſis giues vs plainly to vnderſtand, to all wicked and wordly
men. Behold the place entire as it is ſet downe in your owne Bible. If you
loue me keepe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and I will ask my Father, and he ſhall giue
you an other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,
that he may abide with your for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world
cannot receiue.</hi> And then, ſpeaking of the Pope, you ſay; <hi>We can
haue no certainty that the Spirit of Truth is promiſed to him but vpon
ſuppoſall, that he performes the condition, where vnto the promiſe of the
Spirit of Truth is expressly limited, viz. That he loue God and keep his
commandements; and of this, not knowing the Popes heart, we can haue no
certainty at all.</hi> Doth not this interpretation, and diſcourſe, clearly
declare, that we can haue no certainty of the Apoſtles infallibility,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not knowing their hearts we can haue no certainty at all, that when
they preached, and wrote, they did loue God, and keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements?
Beſides; in the doctrine of Proteſtants, we cannot be certaine by certainty
of Faith, that the Apoſtles kept the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, except firſt we
belieue Scripture and yet we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not belieue Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itſelf, except firſt
we belieue the Apoſtles to be infallible, and to haue kept that condition of
keeping the commandements; Therfore we muſt belieue Scripture, before we
belieue, the Apoſtles to keepe the commandements, and be infallible; and we
muſt belieue the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to be infallible and to keepe the commandements,
before we belieue Scripture; which is an inextricable Circle; and a
contradiction imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finally, that we belieue Scripture for it ſelf (which
you confess no <pb n="773" facs="tcp:59214:401"/>wiſe man will affirme) and that the
belief of Scripture, ſhould be, cauſe of the belief of Scripture, and the
ſame thing be neceſſary to the firſt production of it ſelf. Wherefore
you muſt either renounce this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, of a conditionall Promiſe,
made, yea (as you expreſly affirme) <hi>Appropriated to the Apoſtles,</hi>
or els bid Scripture, and all Chriſtianity, fare well. And ſo you cannot
haue certainty of this particular, that God requires the ſaied condition of
loue, and Obedience.</p>
               <p n="85">85. But to anſwer directly; I ſay you miscite the
words of S. John, while you diſtinguiſh only by a comma <hi>(If you loue me
keepe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements)</hi> from the following words <hi>(And I will ask my
Father, and he ſhall giue you an other Paraclete)</hi> whereas both in our,
and in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Engliſh Bible, they are diſtinct Sections, or

that the condition is not; <hi>If you loue me, I will ask the Father, and he
will giue you &amp;c.</hi> as you ſet it downe, and there vpon affirme that,
the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is <hi>reſtrayned to thoſe only that loue God and keep his
commandements;</hi> but the condition, or rather Aſſirmation, or
Conſequence, is this: <hi>If you loue me, keep my commandements:</hi> And
ſo the ſenſe is very plain, and perfect, and the condition is terminated
in the ſame (N. 15.) And that theſe words, <hi>If you loue me, keep my
commandements,</hi> render a perfect ſenſe, is manifeſt of it ſelf, and
by the like Texts of Scripture, as in the ſame Evangeliſt (Cap. 15. N. 14.)
<hi>You are my friends, if you doe the things that I command you;</hi> and (V.
10.) <hi>If you keep my precepts, you ſhall abide in my Loue.</hi> As
contrarily, the holy Ghoſt is promiſed abſolutely, in this (C: 14. V.
26.) <hi>The Paraclete the Holy Ghoſt, ſhall teach you all things.</hi> And
in the argument, prefixed before this Chapter, in the Proteſtants En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Bible, printed (Ann: 1622.) it is ſayed; (Chriſt N. 15. <hi>requireth loue
and Obedience.</hi> 16. <hi>Promiſeth the Holy Ghoſt the comforter</hi>)
without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing any dependance of the ſaied Promiſe (V. 15.) vpon
loue and obedience. V. 16. As alſo Joan: 16.13. (which Text is alledged both
by <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> and Dr. Potter) it is ſaied without any
<hi>condition when he, the Spirit of Truth commeth, he ſhall teach you all
Truth.</hi> And (Matth: 16.18.) theſe words <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall not
prevaile againſt her</hi> which both <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> and the
Doctor cite, are abſolute. And (Matth: 28. V. 20.) behold (which particle
holy Scripture is wont to vſe, when it ſpeaks of ſome great, or ſtrang
thing) <hi>I am with you all daies, even to the conſummation of the
world.</hi> Which wordsare both ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, <pb n="774" facs="tcp:59214:402"/>without
any condition, and cannot be reſtrayned to the lives of the Apoſtles: and
therfore, dato, non conceſſo, that the Promiſe had bene made to the
Apoſtles, vpon condition of Loving God; it does not follow, that the ſame
condition, muſt be required in every one of their ſucceſſours; but for
the merit of the Apoſtles, it may be communicated to others, in whom the
Apoſtles liue, and ſo what is granted to them, is a reward beſtowed vpon
the Apoſtles; as heroicall acts, of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, are rewarded both in
themſelves, and in their poſterity for their ſake, though their
ſucceſſors be deſtitute of that worth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, without which
condition, theyr firſt progenitors would never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve attained that Dignity,
or Prerogatiue, which afterward is derived to their poſterity abſolutely,
and without any ſuch condition, as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the beginning. Morover;
though it were granted, that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the commandements, were a neceſſary
condition for receyving Infallibility; yet you will never be able to proue, by
any evident Text of Scripture, that it is neceſſary, in reſpect of every
particular perſon; it being ſufficient, that it be veryfied of the Church
Catholique, of which even Dr. Potter (Pag: 10.) ſaieth; that it is <hi>not
improbable only, but meerely impoſsible, the Catholique Church ſhould be
without Charity.</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour, before he encharged the care of
his Church, vpon S. Peter, exacted of him a triple profeſſion of loue; and
will you therfore haue none to be lawfull Paſtors, except ſuch as loue God
aboue all things, and are in ſtate of Grace, and free from deadly ſinne?
Haue you a mynd to fetch from Hell, the condemned, and ſeditious hereſy of
Wicliffe; That, If a Biſhop or Prieſt be in deadly ſinne, he doth not
indeed, either giue Orders, conſecrate, or Baptize? As authority and
Juriſdiction, are not of that nature of things which require Charity, and the
State of Grace, ſo neither is infallibility, no more than working of
Miracles, Gift of tongues, and the like, which by Divines are called Gratiae
gratis datae, and therfore you cannot imagine, with any reaſon that the Holy
Ghoſt cannot be given for ſome Effects, to any who is not in ſtate of
Grace: and I hope you will, at leaſt pretend, to be more certaine, that
Scripture is of infallible Authority, than that every Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Writer did
loue God, and keep the commandements, when they wrote Scripture, yea of ſome
Bookes of Scripture ſome call in Queſtion, who were the writers of them. I
will not heere ſtay, to put you in minde, that it is common among
Proteſtants, to deny the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fibility of keeping the commandements; muſt
they therfore deny the infallibility of the Apoſtles? They are ſo farre
from doing ſo, that they <pb n="775" facs="tcp:59214:402"/>hold the Church to be
infallible in Fundamentalls, notwithſtanding the impoſſibility, in their
opinion, of keeping the commandements!</p>
               <p n="85">85. Now I hope it appeares, that your two Syllogiſmes
goe vpon a falſe ground, that the promiſe made to the Apoſtles is
conditionall, and ſo proue nothing. As alſo, that you breath too much gall,
and vanity, in ſaying, that <hi>Charity Maintayned and generally all our
Writers of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, by whom this Text is vrged, with a bold Sacriledge,
and horrible impiety, ſomewhat like Procruſtes his cruelty, perpetually cut
of the head and foot, the beginning and end of it.</hi> For I ſuppoſe, you
will not hold Dr. Potter for a Writer of Controverſy againſt Proteſtants,
and yet he cites this Text, and leaves out more than <hi>Charity
Maintained</hi> omitts, cutting of not only the head a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d foot, but alſo the
breaſt and middle the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, therby ſhewing his judgment, that the other
words, which you cite out of the precedent (15. and the following 17. verſe)
make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that purpoſe, for which that Text is produced, that is, the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Apoſtles, and Church; and that you by citing thoſe
different verſes without diſtinction, not only joyne head and foot and the
whole Body confuſedly together, which is no less monſtrous than to cutt
them of, but doe indeed vtterly deſtroy, and depriue it of all
infall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility by queſtioning the infallibility of the Apoſtles, from whom
this very Text muſt receiue, all the certainty it can haue. Do not I
maintayne the moſt perfect kind of Charity, in defending my adverſary the
Doctor, in this occaſion, of being forſaken, and even impugned, by whom
alone he hoped to be relieved? And indeed Dr. Potter only, and not <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> ſtands in need of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſeing he alledged thoſe texts
which the Doctor cites only to ſhew, in deeds, that Scripture alone, is not
ſufficient to interpret itſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas D. Potter brought them
abſolutely to proue the infallibility of the Church, in all Fundamentall
Points, which is the common tenet of Proteſtants, and yet you overthrow it by
making our Saviours Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not abſolute, but depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vpon a volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary,
vncertaine condition.</p>
               <p n="86">86. In your (N. 76.) you endeavour, divers wayes, to
elude the Argument, which is wont to be alledged for the infallibility of the
Church, taken out of S. Paul (1. Tim: 3.15.) where the Church is ſaied to be
the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</p>
               <p n="87">87. Firſt, you ſay; <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> is
<hi>ſomewhat too bold with S. Paul. For it is neither impoſſible nor
improbable, theſe words, the Pillar and ground of truth, may haue reference
not to the Church, but to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</hi> 
                  <pb n="776" facs="tcp:59214:403"/>But this
expoſition, is not only againſt Calvin, and other Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who
expreſly refer thoſe words to the Church, but alſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well agree
with the Greek: And even the Proteſtant Engliſh Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation reades it as
we doe, for as much as belongs to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Howeſoever, it
appeares, by this very example, how hard, and impoſſible it is, to
determine Controverſyes by Scripture alone, which every one, will find meanes
to interpret, for his beſt advantage, though it be not donne without violence
to the Text. Neither is it he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous, as you argue, that S. Paul having
called the Church a Houſe, ſhould call it preſently a Pillar. For you
ſhould conſider, that he calls it a Houſe, and Pillar, in different
reſpects: A Houſe of God; the Pillar (not of God, but) of Truth. You will
not deny that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Apoſtolicall Church, was vniverſally
infallible, and ſo, was both the Houſe of God, and Pillar of Truth; and
therefore it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abſonous, or heterogeneous, that the metaphor of a
Houſe, and of a Pillar, be applyed to the ſame thing. Cornelius à
Lapide, heere, ſaieth: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Alludit Apoſtolus ad Bethel, de qua
viſo ibi Domino, dixit Jacob Geneſ: 28. verè non eſt hic aliud
niſi Domus Dei, &amp; porta Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</q> If therefore in that place of
Geneſis to which the Apoſtle alludes, the ſame is ſaied, to be a
Houſe, and a Gate, in diverſe reſpects, a Houſe of God, a Gate of
Heaven; why may he not ſay of the Church, that it is a Houſe of God, a
Pillar of Truth? What greater repugnance is there betwene a Houſe, and a
Pillar, than betwene a Houſe and a Gate? If men may take the liberty to
interpret holy Scripture by ſuch light ſubtilityes, what certainty can ever
be gathered from any Text? What difficulty is there to conceiue, that the
Church ſhould be the Houſe, wherein Gods reſides, and raignes, by
infallibly aſſiſting it, and yet be a Pillar of Truth, to teach others?
Eſpecially ſeing God aſſiſts the Church, to the end ſhe may teach
others? Paſſiuè taught; Actiuè, teaches; as yourſelf avouch
heere (N. 78.) that it is the <hi>eſſence of the Church, to be alwayes the
maintayner and teacher of all neceſſary truth.</hi> But yourſelf profess
not to relie vpon this interpretation, and therefore,</p>
               <p n="88">88. Secondly; you <hi>put</hi> vs <hi>in mynd, that the
Church which S. Paul heere ſpeaks of, was that in which Timothy converſed,
and that was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, and not the Roman, and ſuch we will not
haue to be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="89">89. Anſwer; Although S. Paul ſpoke to Timothy, who
converſed <pb n="777" facs="tcp:59214:403"/>in the particular Church of Epheſus,
whereof he was Biſhop; yet he puts him in mynd, of his duty, by a Motiue and
Reaſon, more vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, and certaine (as Proofes are wont to be) than
could be taken, from that particular Church alone, that is, he gaue a Reaſon,
which did concerne it, as a member of the vniverſall Church, which being the
Pillar, and Ground of Truth, could not but exact of Him, and every Biſhop, a
zeale to imitate, with care and vprightness, their mother the Church, in
conſerving, for their parte, that Truth, which the Church teaches, and from
which ſhe cannot ſwarue. To which very purpoſe, Cornelius à Lapide
vpon theſe words 
<q rend="margQuotes">(Quae eſt columna &amp; firmamentum
veritatis) ſaieth: Addit hoc Apoſtolus, vt innuat Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheo, magno cum
ſtudio ad haereſes &amp; errores devitandos &amp; refel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendos, purae
veritati intelligendae, &amp; praedicandae in Eccleſia, ſibi incumbendum
eſſe, adeoue ſe non judaizantium, aliorumue No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantium,
ſed Eccleſiae fidem ſequi &amp; praedicare debere, vtpote quae ſit
baſis veritatis.</q> And ſo I may retort your Argument, and ſay: S. paul
ſpeakes of a Church which is the Pillar and Ground of Truth; but
Proteſtants teach, that no particular Church is ſuch a Pillar, (even for
things neceſſary to ſalvation, as they ſaie the vniverſall Church is)
Therefore S. Paul ſpeaks not of a particular, but the vniverſall Church.
And by this, I confute what you anſwer,</p>
               <p n="90">90. Thirdly, (N. 77.) That <hi>many Attributes in
Scripture, are not notes of performance, but of duty, and teach vs not what the
thing or Perſon is of neceſſity, but what it ſhould be. Ye are the
ſalt of the Earth, ſaid our Saviour to his Diſciples: Not that this
quality was inſeparable from their Perſons, but becauſe it was their
office to be ſo. For if they muſt haue bene ſo of neceſſity, and
could not haue bene otherwiſe, in vaine had he put them in ſeare of that
which followes, if the ſalt hath loſt his ſavour, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith ſhall it
be ſalted? So the Church may be by duty, the Pillar and Ground, that is, the
Teacher of Truth, of all truth, not only neceſſary but profitable to
ſalvation; and yet ſhe may neglect and violate this duty, and be in fact
the teacher of ſome Errour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="91">91. Anſwer; Even now it hath bene ſaied, that Potter,
and other Proteſtants commonly teach, that the vniverſall Church, cannot
erre in Fundamantall Articles, as a particular Church may; and yet every
particular Church, by duty, is a teacher of all Neceſſary Points;
The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore the vniverſall Church muſt be more; a teacher by duty, and
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Your Proofe, that to be the ſalt of the earth, (which was 
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:59214:404"/>ſpoken to the Apoſtles) ſignifyes only, that it was
infallibly certaine, they ſhould be ſo, tends plainly to Atheiſme, if the
denyall of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all Chriſtianity, muſt bring to Atheiſme, as
certainly it muſt. For take away infallibility from the Apoſtles, what
certainty can you haue, that in fact they haue not neglected and violated their
duty, as you ſay the Church may. You ſtill fall into the ſame miſtake,
that God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not effectually moue vs, to the performance of a thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
neceſſitating our will. Neither doth it follow, that in vaine our Saviour
put them in feare of that which followes, if the ſalt hath loſt his
ſavour &amp;c: For when God doth promiſe a thing, he doth not exclude
meanes, or our endeavour, to the application of which he can alſo moue vs
effectually, without prejudice to the freedom of our will. The Apoſtles in
the Councell which they held at Hieruſalem, were certaine not to determine
any Errour; and yet they vſed great diligence, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and diſpute;
(Act: 15.7.) I ſuppoſe you will not deny that S. John was infallibly
aſſiſted in writting his Goſpell, and yet S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom (in praef: in
Evangel. Matth:) ſaieth, that he could not be intreated to ſet on that holy
Work, but vpon condition, that, indicto jejunio, in commune omnes Deum
deprecarentur, the Chriſtians ſhould haue a fett faſt, and all ſhould
joyne in prayer to God. Do you not belieue, that God did ſo aſſiſt the
Writers of Canonicall Scripture, that they were infallible in their writings,
and yet that they might exerciſe an act of obedience, and freely (though
infallibly) follow the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt? It is cleare, that you
muſt either deny freedom of will to the Writers, or infallibility to their
writings, or grant, that free will, and infallibility, are not incompatible. I
might add to all this, that men may looſe themſelves, not only by error in
Faith, but alſo by an ill life, whereby Preachers deſtroy by deeds, what
they pretended to build in words: Which Anſwer would evacuate the force of
your Argument; but I haue ſaied enough of this matter.</p>
               <p n="92">92. Fourthly; (N. 78.) you anſwer; that, we muſt
proue, that by Truth in the ſaied Text, is meant all Truth, both
Fundamentall, and profitable; and that you grant it to be the Eſſence of
the Church, to be a maintayner and teacher of all neceſſary truth. But this
evaſion, hath bene confuted already, out of your owne aſſertion, that we
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belieue the Church in Fundamentall Articles, vnless ſhe be
infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in all; and this vrges moſt clearely in your opinyon, who profess
it impoſſible, to know, what Points in particular be Fundamentall. 
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:59214:404"/>And I beſeech you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, that S. Paul ſpeaks of
the primitiue Church of thoſe tymes, which you will not deny to haue bene
infallible; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he ſpeak of the vniverſall Church (as in this
Fourth Anſwer you ſuppoſe he doth) you muſt grant, that Church to be
infallible in all Fundamentall, and vnfundamentall Points: And ſo this Text
cannot be reſtrayned to Fundamentall Truths.</p>
               <p n="93">93. Your (N. 79.80.) Pretends to anſwer the Argument,
taken out of S. Paul (Epheſ: 4.) <hi>He gaue ſome Apoſtles, and ſome
prophets, and other ſome Evangeliſts, and other ſome Paſtors and
Doctors, to the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Saints, vnto the work of the
Miniſtery, vnto the edifying of the Body of Chriſt: Vntill we meete all
into the vnity of Faith, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Sonne of God, into a perfect ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
into the meaſure of the age of the fulnes of Chriſt: That now we be not
children wavering, and carried about with every wind of doctrine in the
wickednes of men, in craftines, to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvention of Errour.</hi> Out of
which words it appeares, that God hath left to his Church, Paſtors and
Doctors, to the conſummation of Saynts, which compriſes the whole ſpace
of this world, vntill all be brought to the vnity of Faith, (which is
neceſſary not only for the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the Apoſtles, but alſo afterward)
and in ſuch manner, as that we be not wavering, but haue ſome firme
infallible Ground, on which to relie, in matters of Faith.</p>
               <p n="94">94. To this place you anſwer; that <hi>(He gaue)</hi>
is not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>(He promiſed that he would giue vnto the
worlds end)</hi> but that, <hi>not the infallibility, of any Church, but
Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts &amp;c: which Chriſt gaue vpon
his Aſcention, were deſigned by him, for the compaſſing all theſe
excellent purpoſes, by their preaching while they lived, and by their
writings for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="95">95. But this interpretation, and reſtriction of yours,
is not only repugnant to the Text itſelf, but againſt all Proteſtants,
and I may ſaie, againſt all Chriſtians, of whom not any deny, that our
Saviour promiſed to giue Paſtors, Doctors, Preachers, Miniſters &amp;c:
to the worlds end; if not for contributing infallibility to the Church, at
leaſt for other good, and neceſſary purpoſes, and effects, as teaching,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching, governing, enacting Lawes, inflicting Cenſures, puniſhing,
adminiſtring Sacraments &amp;c: Calvin (Inſtit: Lib. 4. Cap 1. N. 5.)
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves this at large, out of this ſame Text of S. Paul. Your Socinian
Brother Volkelius (de vera Relig: Lib: 6. Cap: 5.) cites even this place, and
ſayeth: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Remanſit Doctorum,
Paſtorumue officium, nec non alia <pb n="780" facs="tcp:59214:405"/>quaedam.</q>
The ſame is the doctrine of other learned Proteſtants, as I haue ſet
downe heretofore in particular, out of Brereley (Tract: 2. Cap: 2. Sect: 1.) In
ſo much as Doctor Saravia (in defenſ: Tract: de diverſis Miniſtrorum
gradibus Pag: 10.) <hi>Profeſſes to wonder with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that any
Queſtion ſhould be made thereof.</hi> And who are you, to oppoſe
yourſelf againſt all other, and limit <hi>(He gaue)</hi> tothe tyme of the
Apoſtles? Is any thing more common amongſt Proteſtants, than that
Preaching of the word, and Adminiſtration of Sacraments (and conſequently
Preachers, and Miniſters of Sacraments) are eſſentiall to the true
Church?</p>
               <p n="96">96. You object, that by, <hi>(he gaue)</hi> to
vnderſtand, <hi>he promiſed that he would giue to the worlds end</hi> is an
interpretation, of which you ſay to <hi>Charity Maintayned, What reaſon
haue you for this conceypt? Can you ſhew that the word,</hi> edoke <hi>hath
this ſignification in other places, and that it muſt haue it in this place?
Or will not this interpretation driue you preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this blaſphemous
abſurdity, that God hath not performed his promiſe? Vnless you will ſay,
which for ſhame I think you will not, that you haue now, and in all ages
ſince Chriſt haue had Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts: For as
for Paſtors and Doctors alone, they will not ſerue the turne. For if God
promiſed to giue all theſe, then you muſt ſay he hath given all, or els
that he hath broken his promiſe. Neither may you pretend, that the Paſtors
and the Doctors were the ſame with the Apoſtles, and Prophets, and
Evangeliſts, and therefore having Paſtors and Doctors you haue all. For it
is apparent, that by theſe names, are denoted ſeuerall Orders of men,
clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely diſtinguiſhed and diverſifyed by the Originall Text; but much
more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by your owne Tranſlations; for ſo you read it, ſome
Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and other ſome Evangeliſts, and other
ſome Pastors and Doctors: And yet more plainly in the paralell place</hi> 1.
<hi>Cor:</hi> 12. <hi>to which we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by your vulgar Tranſlation,
God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily
Prophets, thirdly Teachers, therefore this ſubterfuge is ſtopped againſt
you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="97">97. Anſwer; this which you are pleaſed to ſtile a
conceypt, is the conceypt of all Proteſtants, as I haue ſhewed. That the
word <hi>dedit</hi> hath the ſignification of a Promiſe, in other places
will appeare, to any that can but read the Concordance of the Bible, as Joan:
(Epiſt: 1. Cap: 5. N. 11.) Dedit nobis vitam aeternam, which word dedit,
ſaieth, Cornelius à Lapide vpon this place, 
<q rend="margQuotes">ſignificat firmitatem &amp;
certtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem Promiſſionis divinae: Quod ſcilicet ita certi ſimus de
vita <pb n="781" facs="tcp:59214:405"/>aeterna, ſi in Fide &amp; obedientia Chriſti
perſeveremus, perinde ac ſi actu ea nobis data eſſet, eamque reipſa
poſſideremus: And S. Auſtine in (Pſalmo. 60. N. 6.) vpon theſe words;
Dediſti haereditatem timen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus nomen tuum; ſaieth: Perſeveremus in
timore nominis Dei; ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus Pater non nos fallit;</q> where it is cleare the
word, dediſti ſignifyes a Promiſe of things; as Bellarmine alſo
explicates the ſame dediſti, by, firmiter promiſiſti. S. John (C. 10.
V. 28.) ſaieth, Ego vitam aeternam do eis, where Cornelius a Lapide ſaieth:
Do ijs, quia nimirum promitto eis vitam aeternam. And ſo we ſee that (Dedit
Apoſtolos &amp;c:) expreſſes the certainty of Gods Promiſe, more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
if he had expreſſly ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I will giue. But to what purpoſe, ſhould
I ſay more? ſeing there can be no more plaine ſignification, of dedit,
than appointed, or conſtituted for his Church, Apoſtles &amp;c: as appeares
by the ſcope of the Apoſtle in this Chapter from the beginning, which was
to exhort Chriſtians to Charity, and keeping the vnity of Spirit in the bond
of peace, as one body a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d one Spirit; which exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it is was directed
to the Church of all ages, ſo the meanes to performe it, muſt extend to the
worlds end; and this meanes S. Paul declares to be the Authority and offices of
Apoſtles, Paſtors &amp;c: to the conſummation of Saints, and meeting in
vnity of Faith. And the ſame intention of the Apoſtle appeares, in that
which you call the pararell place (1. Cor: 12.) where that (as he ſaied V.
24.) there might be no Schiſme in the Body, he ſhewes that every one ought
to be content, with his owne degree, ſeing God will haue it ſo, that in his
Church, there ſhould be different Degrees, functions, and Offices; and then
(Verſ: 27.) ſpecifies Apoſtles, Prophets &amp;c: All which declares, that
he ſpoke of the Church for ever, to the worlds end, as Vnity is ever
neceſſary, againſt Diviſion, and Schiſme.</p>
               <p n="98">98. And now, who is found guilty of blaſphemous
abſurdity? We haue heard your Volkelius ſay: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Remanſit Paſtorum, Doctorumque
officium, nec non alia quaedam;</q> and the ſame is the Doctrine of other
Proteſtants. How then hath God performed his Promiſe, if for the
perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance therof; it be neceſſary, that in all ages there be Apoſtles,
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Evangeliſts, and that de facto there be not ſuch, as you
ſay, there are not? wheras Catholiques are certaine the Church ſhall never
be deſtitute of ſuch degrees; and therfore Proteſtants alone muſt be
driven to that <hi>blaſphemous abſurdity, that God hath not performed his
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> And I may turne againſt yourſelf your owne argument, thus:
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:59214:406"/>Our Saviour Promiſed to his Church Apoſtles,
Prophets, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, as he Promiſed, Paſtors, and Doctors; But he
promiſed Paſtors and Doctors for ever, (as Proteſtants teach:) Therfore
he promiſed Apoſtles, Prophets, and Evangeliſts for ever. And then
further: ſeing our Saviour promiſed infallibility, to thoſe of whom S.
Paul ſpeakes, as you ſuppoſe, we muſt firmely belieue, that they who
ſhall remaine to the worlds end, are indued with infallibility.</p>
               <p n="99">99. But heere it is to be conſidered, that ſome
things are eſſentiall to the Being of Apoſtolate, or Office of an
Apoſtle; other are acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, without which it may conſiſt. Of the
eſſence of Apoſtolate, is, power of Order and Juriſdiction, in vtroque
foro, as Divines ſpeak; and infallibility for matters belonging to Faith,
without which, men could not be obliged, to belieue them, with an Act of divine
Faith, which requires abſolute certainty. Of the other kind I haue ſpoken,
and given examples, aboue; and I hope you will not deny power of
excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting becauſe it is not, as I may ſaie, ſeconded, with a
viſible delivering to Satan the perſon ſo cenſured; nor that
Chriſtians receiue not the holy Ghoſt, becauſe they ſee no firy toungs,
nor ſpeak all languages. If then, power of Juriſdiction, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Governing, be
eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially required to the office of an Apoſtle (which power I hope you
will not deny to remayne in the Church) and that accordingly, even the chief
Proteſtant Saravia, (as is related by Adamus Contzen (in Cap: 16. Matth: V.
29. Queſt: 1. N. 6.) teaches that the eſſence of Apoſtolate requires,
Officium praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi, adminiſtrandi Sacramenta, &amp; poteſtatem
gubernandi, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but that, Apoſtolate, or Apoſtolicall
office, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is, and ſhall remaine in the Church, to the
worlds end. And therfore you ſpoke vnadviſedly (to ſay no more) in
ſaying to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Maintayned; For ſhame you will not ſay, that you
haue now, and in all Ages ſince Chriſt haue had Apoſtles &amp;c:</hi> and
yet, as a Divine ought to haue done, you goe not about to informe vs, in what
the Eſſence of Apoſtleſhip conſiſts. For if you will haue it
conſiſt in this, That they were choſen by our Saviour immediatly, you
muſt exclude S. Matthias from the Apoſtolicall Colledg; and if you
reſpect only the name of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, you muſt increaſe the number of
twelue, by adding Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus (Philip: 2.25.) and Andronicus, and Junia (Rom:
16.7.) who are ſaied to be noble among the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="100">100. But doubtless we cannot pretend to haue Prophets.
Yes, we can; and with good reaſon. Your Uolkelius (Lib: 6. Cap: 5.) ſaieth:

                  <q rend="margQuotes">Prophetarum nomine in iſtis locis (1.

on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmes, that the interpretation of Scripture is called Prophecy, but
that perhaps in the New Teſtament, this acception is more frequent, than that
other of revealing hidden things. And (beſide what we haue cited out of
Volkelius) this is alſo the interpretation of the Proteſtant Marloratus (1.
Cor: 12. V. 28. and in this place Epheſ: 4.11.) I need not repeete what I
ſaied, that there are never wanting in Gods Church holy men, indued with the
Gift of Prophecy. Neither are they only Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, who wrote the
Goſpells, but as Uolkelius ſaieth loco citato;

then we haue proved, that we haue Apoſtles, there cannot want Evangeliſts
in this ſenſe: and we ſee that Act. (21. V. 8.) Philip is called an
Evangeliſt; and S. Paul: (2. Timoth: 4. V. 5.) ſaieth to Timothy, Opus fac
Evangeliſtae; ſo that not only they were Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, who wrote, but
thoſe alſo who declared, and publiſhed the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, to others: And
Cornelius à Lapide cites the judgment of S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ, Theoph: and S.
Anſelme, that Evangeliſts are deacons, as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip was; Nam quamvis non
ſint Sacerdotes evangelizare tamen poſſunt ex cathedra, quemadmodum &amp;
Stephanus, &amp; Pilippus: And S. Anſelm, obſerves that even in theſe
tymes Deacons ſing the Goſpell; and in their Ordination, they receyue power
to preach the Goſpell. But beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des all this, I deſire to know (when for
explication of dedit, he gaue, you ſay it ſignifyes, that Chriſt gaue at
his Aſcenſion, Apoſtles, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Evangeliſts) what you meane
by at his Aſcenſion? Seing at our Saviours Aſcenſion, there were no
Evangeliſts, who wrote any Goſpell of S. Matthew, that was the firſt,
being written about eight <pb n="784" facs="tcp:59214:407"/>yeares after our Saviour
Aſcenſion, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Goſpell of S. John was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about the yeare our
Lord ninetynine of; how then can you explicate (He gaue) to ſignify only what
he actually left to his Church, and not with a reference to the future, what he
was to leaue? The like Demand may be made, concerning the Apoſtles;
conſidering, that S. Matthias was preſently choſen, and S. Paul ſome
two yeares after our Saviours Aſcenſion, was extraordinarily called, to be
an Apoſtle? Laſtly; the ſame Promiſe, may reſpect different objects,
according to their diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of nature; and may be vnderſtood, perpetuall
in reſpect of thoſe, which are alwayes neceſſary to the Church, and in
order to others, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to a tyme, according to their exigence; and ſo God
ſhould not faile of his promiſe, but performe it, according to the firſt
intention therof; as Proteſtants are wont to ſay, that God promiſed the
Gift of miracles for a tyme only, and yet it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be denyed, but that at the
ſame tyme he gaue a command to preach, and baptize, and a promiſe, that he
who believeth, and is baptized ſhall be ſaved; (Mark 16.) both which, were
to laſt till the worlds end. You ſay; <hi>can you ſhew that the word</hi>

it in this place?</hi> Whereby you ſignify, that though it had this
ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in an hundred other places, yet that were not enough, to
ſhew that it muſt haue it in this; which is very true. For, to be affirmed
in Scripture but once, is as much as to be affirmed, a mill yon of tymes; and
ſeing you can giue no certaine Rule, whether I muſt vnderſtand, that one
place by thoſe many, or contrarily the greater number, by that one, it
appeares, even by this, how hard a thing it is, to know the true ſenſe of
Scripture, without a Living Guide; which was the end for which <hi>Charity

we haue ſpoken; all which, though indeed they be cleare enough for the
infallibility of the Church, yet we ſee, what eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions you ſeek to the

contayning no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which hath not bene anſwered already. Only I wiſh, you
had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, what your vnderſtand in your (N. 2.) by theſe words:
<hi>Every one of the fundamentall Rules of good life and action is to be
believed to come from God, and therfore virtually includes an article of
Faith.</hi> For if thoſe Rules be revealed, they do not only virtually
include an article of Faith, but they are properly, and formally, objects, and
articles of Divine Faith. If they be not revealed by God, they are no more
articles, or objects of Faith, than a thing not viſible, can be the object of
our eyes, or a thing without ſound, or not audible, the object of our eares,
&amp;c. You ſay, they <hi>come from God, and therefore include virtually an
Article of Faith.</hi> If you meane, they come from God, as he is the efficient
Cauſe of all things; that is common to all Creatures, and therefore not
ſufficient to include an article of Faith: If they come from God, as
revealing, and teſtifying them to be true; they are formall Objects of Faith,
as I ſaied, and do not only <hi>virtually include an Article of Faith.</hi>
But it may be feared, that in theſe words there lurkes ſome hidden
poyſon; as if the rules of good life <pb n="789" facs="tcp:59214:409"/>and action, as
they are knowen, by the light of naturall Reaſon (and not as they are
revealed, and ſo become formall Objects of Faith) were ſufficient, to
direct our life, for bringing vs to ſalvation, and that no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
knowledg were neceſſary. No less obſcure are your other words, that,
<hi>Fundamentall Doctrines of Faith, are ſuch, as though they haue influence
vpon our lives, as every eſſentiall Doctrine of Chriſtianity hath, yet we
are commanded to belieue them, and not to doe them.</hi> For by theſe words,
how do you diſtinguiſh Credenda, from agenda, if both haue influence vpon
our lives, and in neither of them, the act of our vnderſtanding or
aſſent, is that which we doe, but only it is the act which directs vs to
doe other things, and ſo hath influence vpon our lives? But theſe things I
omitt, and come to</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your (N. 11.) wherin you ſay to <hi>C: Ma: Your
diſtinction between points neceſſary to be believed, and neceſsary not
to be disbelieved, is more ſubtile than ſound, a diſtinction without a
difference. There being no point neceſſary to be believed, which is not
neceſsary not to be disbelieved.</hi> Anſwer: this laſt is very true. For
in that caſe, there concurrs both the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue precept, of exercicing an
explicite act of Faith, and the Negatiue, of not disbelieving any truth
revealed by God. But that which you ad, <hi>nor no point to any man, at any
time, in any circumſtances neceſſary not to be disbelieved, but it is to
the ſame man, at the ſame tyme in the ſame circumſtances neceſſary
to be believed</hi> is manifeſtly vntrue. For, when it is propoſed to ones
vnderſtanding, that God hath revealed ſome Truth, he may truly judge, that
there is no affirmatiue Precept, which obliges him, at that tyme to exerciſe
any act of Faith, about that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oular object; and therfore may reſolue to
abſtaine or forbeare, to produce any ſuch aſſent of Faith, but think of
ſomething els (and may haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doe ſo, v.g. if ſome act of an
other vertue be more preſſing at that tyme) and yet he ſhould ſinne
damnably, if he did poſitively diſſent: And ſo, at the ſame tyme it
may be neceſſary not to disbelieue ſome Truth, and yet not be
neceſſary, actually to belieue it. It is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in the ſchooles,
whether the will can ſtay the vnderſtanding, from yealding aſſent, to a
concluſion deduced evidently, from evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Premiſſes. But no man can
doubt, whether the will may draw our vnderſtanding, from a poſitiue actuall
aſſent, to the Objects of Faith, which are ſo obſcure, that they
require a pious affection in the will, which therfore may diſſent, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d are
ſo difficult, that for every act of faith, we need the particular
ſupernaturall aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt: and <pb n="790" facs="tcp:59214:410"/>then what wonder is it, that we may abſtaine from doing that, which
is not in our ſole power to performe? and to which we are forced, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
metaphyſically, as I haue ſhewed, nor morally, becauſe we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
there is no affirmatiue precept, to exerciſe ſuch an act of Faith, in
thoſe circumſtances. It ſeemes you haue a mynd againſt all Divines to
make no difference between the affirmatiue, and Negatiue Precept of Faith,
wherof <hi>Cha. Ma.</hi> ſpeakes (Part 1. Chap: 3. N. 2.) and what he
ſaieth, may be applied to our preſent purpoſe, and who will ſay, That
every one, is alwayes obliged to be exerciſing a poſitiue act of Faith,
vpon all thoſe objects, which he can never disbelieue? May not a man, reading
or hearing ſome part of Scripture, only conceiue it per primam
apprehenſionem, without affirming or denying, as when one learnes without
Booke, or only conſiders the phraſe, or writes as at a copie, and the
like.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You continue your diſcourſe, and ſay to
<hi>Charity Maintayned, Yet that which (I belieue) you would haue ſaied, I
acknowledg true, that many points which are not neceſſary to be believed
abſolutely, are yet neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed vpon a ſuppoſition,
that they are knowen to be revealed by God: that is, become then neceſſary
to be believed, when they are kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to be Divine Revelations.</hi> But
<hi>Ch. Ma:</hi> hath no reaſon to accept as a favour this explication of
yours, which containes falſe doctrine, as if all truths became neceſſary
to be believed, by an explicite, actuall belief, when they are known to be
divine Revelations; which is not vniverſally, or neceſſarily true, it
being in rigor ſufficient, that they be not disbelieved. This was the ſcope
of <hi>Charity Maintayned;</hi> to ſhew, that to alledg the Creed, as
containing all Fundamentall Points, was nothing to the purPoſe, for relief of
Proteſtants, who differ in ſuch manner, as what one believes to be revealed
by God, an other rejects, and disbelieves; and therfore though it were granted
that Proteſtants did agree in all the articles of the Creed, (which thing I
haue demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated not to be true) nevertheless, they could not all prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to be ſaved becauſe ſome of them muſt be convinced to reject Divine
Revelations. But now for the Point in hand; you know all Chriſtians belieue,
Every Text of Scripture to be revealed by God; are they therfore obliged, to be
ſtill exerciſing an explicite act of Faith, concerning them? Rather of the
two, and ſpeaking in generall, and perſe loquendo, or ex natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra rei, if
they be not Fundamentall articles, it may ſo fall out, that you are never
obliged to affoard them any ſuch poſitiue Aſſent; and ſo you 
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:59214:410"/>remaine obliged never to dis belieue them, and yet never
obliged, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely to belieue them; which is a true propoſition, againſt
your vniverſall contradictory Doctrine, that <hi>No point to any man; at any
time, can be neceſſary not to be disbelieved, but it is to the ſame man,
at the ſame tyme, neceſſary to be believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The reſt of this Number, as alſo your (N. 12.13.13.
for this Number is put twice 14.15.16. (there is no N. 17.) haue bene
anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red already. <hi>C. Miſt.</hi> with all Divines, ſuppoſes, that
no man can be obliged to belieue any point not ſufficiently propounded, as
Dr. Potter alſo teaches, and is evident to the very light of naturall
Reaſon. I beſeech the Reader, for confuting your (N. 15.) to peruſe
<hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> (N. 3.) And how do you tell vs in this (N. 15.) that the
certainty you haue of the Cteed is from conſtant Tradition; ſeing you
profess, that we haue no vniverſall Tradition, except that which delivers to
vs the Scripture? If you belief the Creed, <hi>that it was from the Apoſtles,
and containes the principles of Faith</hi> (as you ſay) for vniverſall
Tradition, <hi>and not for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> (as you expreſly confess) you
free men from obligation, of reading, or knowing the Scripture, for all
neceſſary points of belief, which by this meanes, they may find
independently of Scripture, and with as much certainty, as you belieue
Scripture, which you profess to receiue from vniverſall Tradition, for which
you alſo belieue the Creed. And ſo you overthrow the moſt vniverſall
Doctrine of Proteſtants, that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is neceſſary, and that (not from
Tradition) but from it alone, we muſt learne all things belonging to
ſalvation. And how did we heare you ſay (Pag. 178. N. 80.) that the
Apoſtles did by their preaching, while they lived, and by their writings or
Scripture after their death, doe keepe men in vnity, ſeing now you
acknowledg, a Tradition diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from, and independent of Scripture, whereby
we may be kept in vnity? Now, if we receiue the Creed from the Church, we
muſt belieue her to be infallible, and that to oppoſe any propoſall of
hers, is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though one belieue the whole Creed; and therfore it is
impertinent to alledg the Creed, to aſſert vnity of Faith among
Proteſtants, while they differ in other points of Faith, not contayned in the
Creed; and ſo <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> ſaied truly, that it was both fals, and
impertinent, to ſay, The Creed containes all neceſſary points of Faith.
But heere I muſt intreate you to conſider, how you can ſay (as you doe in
this place) <hi>The certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I haue of the Creed, That it was from the
Apoſtles, and containes the principles of Faith, I ground it not vpon
Scripture?</hi> Seing (Pag. 149. N. 37.) <pb n="792" facs="tcp:59214:411"/>you ſay
expreſly: <hi>Proteſtants ground their beliefe, that ſuch and ſuch
things only are fundamentalls, only vpon Scripture, and goe about to proue
their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion true, only by Scripture.</hi> Can Proteſtants ground
their belief, that ſuch and ſuch things only are fundamentalls, only vpon
Scripture, and yet not ground vpon Scripture the certainty, which they haue
that the Creed containes all fundamentalls, and ſo know all fundamentalls
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently of Scripture?</p>
               <p n="6">6. You ſay (N. 18.) That the <hi>laſt objection</hi>
of Ch. Ma. <hi>ſtands vpon a falſe and dangerous ſuppoſition: That new
hereſies may ariſe.</hi> But with what conſcience, do you object this to
<hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> who only repeats what Dr. Porter affirmed (Pag. 126.) about
the ariſing of new Hereſies, which is ſo manifeſt, that you expreſly
take notice of it, and reject the Doctrine of the Doctor in that behalf. I
beſeech the Reader to ſee <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> where he demonſtrates, that
ſeing the Doctor confeſſes, that new Hereſies may ariſe, and that
therefore the Creed was neceſſarily explained by other Creeds of Nyce
&amp;c. ſo it will need particular explanation, againſt other emergent
Hereſies, and ſo is not, nor ever will be, of itſelf alone, a
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Catalogue of all Points of Faith: which deduction of <hi>Ch.
Ma.</hi> is ſo cleare, that you giue only this anſwer: <hi>This
explication</hi> of (Dr. Potter) <hi>and reſtriction of this doctrine</hi>
(that the Creed containes a Catalogue of all neceſſary Points of Faith)
<hi>whereof you make your advantage was to my vnderſtanding
vnneceſſary.</hi> And ſo you leaue your client, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the
Argument of <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> to be convincing. As for the thing itſelf; All
that you object againſt D. Potter (whom I now defend againſt you) can
receiue ſtrength only from equivocation, the thing itſelf being cleare;
That we admit no new Revelation, but only new application, or declaration, of
that which was revealed: which application is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly neceſſary, before
one can be obliged to belieue, vnless you will haue men belieue they know not
what. Now whether you will call this application, or declaration, only a
neceſſary condition ſine qua not, or parte of the formall object of
Faith, makes nothing to our preſent purpoſe, but is learnedly handled by
Catholique Divines. Certaine we are, that it is not the totall, or principall,
but only a partiall, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary object, if it belong at all to the
formall object of our Belief: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any man imagine, that the
application to vs, of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, is the <hi>eſſentiall forme, and
laſt complement of an Article of Faith,</hi> if by laſt complement and
eſſentiall forme, you meane that which is the chiefeſt, and moſt
principall, which is only the Divine Teſtimony <pb n="793" facs="tcp:59214:411"/>or
Revelation, and therefore you ſhew, either ignorance, or ſome worſe
thing, in ſuppoſing, that we make Divine Revelation, to be the <hi>matter,
and ſufficient declaration to be the forme of an Article of Faith.</hi> No
doubt but the Apoſtles declared, what our Saviour had revealed to them, but
when, inimicus homo ſuperſeminavit zizania, and ſome began to doubt, or
broach errours againſt thoſe revealed Truths, a declaration was
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to be made, by that Meanes, which God hath left to decide
Controverſyes in Religion, as we ſaied hertofore, about Canonicall Books of
Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I need ſay no more to your (N. 19.) than only, that
ſeing you and Dr. Potter pretend, that the Creed containes only Credenda, and
not Agenda, you further men no more towards ſalvation, than one who would
bring you half way to your journeyes end, and then for your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comfort
tell you, that neither hee, or any other could conduct you, further; as in this
place you doe; firſt, referring him to Scripture for full ſatisfaction; and
then telling him, that to giue a particular <hi>Catalogue of Fundamentall, is
impoſsible.</hi> Of the difference betwene the Catalogue, which <hi>Ch.
Ma.</hi> gives, and that which you aſſigne, I haue ſpoken herto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Your (N. 20.) is but a paſſage to your following
(N. 21.22.23.24.) Wherein you heape words vpon words, and Syllogiſme vpon
Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme, rather to amuſe or amaze, than inſtruct the Reader. But all
will vaniſh into nothing, by theſe conſiderations. 1. That the belief of
ſome points may be neceſſary for the Church, though not for every
particular perſon, which therefore if the Creed doth not containe, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
be ſaied to comprehend all neceſſary points. 2. When queſtion is,
whether the Creed containe all Fundamentall Articles, it muſt be vnderſtood
in ſuch manner as by it alone, we may be ſure to know all Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
points, and conſequently, 3. that by it alone we may know the true ſenſe
of all ſuch points. 4. That yet (as <hi>Ch. Ma</hi> ſhewes N. 4.5.) it is
impoſſible to know by the Creed alone, the meaning of all neceſſary
Articles, as is manifeſt by the diſagreement of Proteſtants from
Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and amongſt themſelves. 5. That therefore the Creed, without
Tradition, and interpretation of the Church, is ſo farre from enabling vs, to
belieue all Fundamentall points, that men left to themſelves, would be ſure
to take occaſion thereby, of many Errours, and Hereſies, as experience hath
taught the world. But if you take the Creed, with the Living voyce, Tradition,
and declaration of the Church, it cannot <pb n="794" facs="tcp:59214:412"/>availe you who
reject the Authority of the Church. 6. Whatſoever the ancient Fathers, or
moderne Writers, deliver concerning the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Creed, for
matters of Faith, they alwayes take it, with the Tradition of the Church; and
ſo not the Creed alone, but the Creede with Tradition, is that of which they
ſpeake, and therefore are ſo farre from ſpeaking home to your purpoſe,
that in every one of their ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they oppoſe your Aſſertion,
concerning the Creed; which is ſo clearely true, that you procede to the
abandoning, and euen oppoſing Dr. Potter, for mentioning the explanation of
the Creed, by Councells, or the Church. Neither can you with any ſhadow of
reaſon, proue, that it was, neceſſary, the Creed ſhould contayne all
neceſſary points of Faith, vnless firſt you begg an other Queſtion,
that the Church is not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For if ſhe be infallible (as moſt
certainly ſhe is) we ſhall be ſure, that in all occaſions, ſhe will
ſupply, what is not expreſſed in the Creed, as we ſaied of Scripture:
neither is it our parte to examine, why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſet not downe all
particulars, as it is cleare, they haue delivered ſome points of less moment,
than are diverſe myſteryes of our Saviours life, omitted by them; and will
you ask them, why did you ſo? 7. We may infer out of what hath bene ſaied;
That although the Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in the Creed, may ſeeme to be comprized
in a ſmall compass, if we reſpect the words; yet if we conſider the
ſenſe, and ſuch maine Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as haue connexion with them, they cannot
be declared in few words; but muſt be declared by Catechiſts, Paſtors,
Doctors, and, in a word, by the Church: in proofe whereof I referr the Reader
to <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

what <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> notes N. 9. 
<q rend="margQuotes">(That all points of Faith may be
ſaied to be contained in the Creed in ſome ſenſe; as, for example
implicitely, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, or in ſome ſuch involved manner. For when we
belieue the Catholique Church, we do implicitely belieue whatſoever ſhe
propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as belonging to Faith. Or els by way of reduction &amp;c.)</q> All
your objections are anſwered. For when <hi>Charity Maintoyned</hi> (N. 8.)
affirmes; That the Creed containes ſuch generall <hi>heads as were moſt
fitting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for preaching the Faith of Chriſt to Iewes, and
Gentiles &amp;c.;</hi> He means not of the bare words, but of the ſenſe, as
he expreſly declares (N. 4. and 5.) which meaning we are to receyue from the
Church, declaring in all occaſions, what occurs neceſſary to ſalvation:
and ſo, as I ſaied, <pb n="795" facs="tcp:59214:412"/>there was no neceſſity, that
all neceſſary points ſhould be contayned in the Creed, otherwiſe than
in ſome generall manner, v.g. in the Article of the Church, as herefore we
ſaied out of S. Auſtine, concerning Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and as Repentance, the
Sacrament of Baptiſme, and Pennance (which are to be reckoned inter Agenda)
are implied in the Article of Remiſſion of ſinnes; as Potter (Pag. 237.)
ſaieth, that the Euchariſt is evidently included in the Communion of
Saynts, and yet (Pag. 235.) he teaches, that the Sacraments are rather to be
reckoned among the Agenda of the Church, than the credenda: And, vitam
aeternam, may ſignify, not only, that we beleue, but alſo that we Hope for
that Life: yea <hi>Ch. ma.</hi> (N. 5.) ſhewes, that in the Article of our
Saviours being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, are contayned many other chiefe points belonging to
practiſe; or Agenda: As likewiſe the Article of the Church containes,
Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Diſcipline, Power to excommunicate, &amp;c. ſo that there is
no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to vnderſtand the Creed only of ſpeculatiue Objects: and
then what reaſon can you giue, why ſome Agenda are implied, and not other?
And ſo your diſcourſe (N. 22.) which goes vpon this ground, that the
Creed containes meerely Credenda, vaniſheth into nothing, and <hi>Ch.
Ma.</hi> neither needs, nor can accept your explication of his words, when you
make him ſay (which was to comprehend all ſuch generall heads of Faith,
which being points of ſimple belief were moſt fit and requiſite &amp;c.)
whereas He (N. 8.) which heer you cite, hath no ſuch limitation to points of
ſimple belief, as may be ſeene not only in <hi>Ch. ma.;</hi> but alſo in
the beginning of your (N. 21.) where you profess to ſerdowne his words: Only
in the end of his ſaied (N. 8.) he cites the Doſtrine of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the
Creed contaynes only credenda. Neither will you be able to find, in all <hi>Ch.
ma.</hi> that he ever reaches, that the Creed containes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch Articles,
as are meerely ſpeculatiue, but only mentions it as taught by Potter: nor
haue you any reaſon to exact of him <hi>(Ch. Ma.)</hi> that he ſhould haue
added the particles, all, or ſome, ſeing his Propoſitions, though
ſeeming indefinite, yet were ſufficiently declared by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and
circumſtances. And therefore I muſt put you in mynd, that you take too much
vpon you, when you giue this Title to this Chapter. That <hi>the Creed
containes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> neceſſary
Points of meere belief.</hi> Now whoſoever pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thoſe Premiſſes
with attention, will ſee that your multitude and Aggregation of
Syllogiſmes, haue only this, that they are more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be
vnderſtood, than anſwered.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Your (N. 24.) is anſwered by only reading the whole
(N. 9.) <pb n="796" facs="tcp:59214:413"/>of <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> you cite it (N. 10.) For it
will be found, that you are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only vpon your falſification of his
words when you object, <hi>No pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is implied in any other, which is
not deducible from it.</hi> But where doth <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> ſay the contrary?
He expreſſly ſpeaks (N. 9.) of points which by <hi>evident and
neceſſary conſequence, may be deduced from Articles both clearly, and
particularly contained in the Creed:</hi> and I hope you will not ſay, that
every propoſition implied in an other, is deducible from it <hi>by evident
and neceſſary conſequence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. You vrge: <hi>The Article of the Catholique Church,
wherin you will haue all implied, implies nothing to any purpoſe of yours,
vnless out of meere favour we will grant the ſenſe of it to be, that the
Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and that yours is the Church.</hi> Anſwer;
Independently of the Creed, we proue the infallibility of the Church; and we
muſt not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it at the firſt from the meaning of this Article, but we
learne the ſenſe of this Article from the Church pre-believed to be
infallible. And ſeing you profess to receiue the Creed (and even Scripture)
from the Tradition of the Church, you cannot be certaine, that the contents
therof are true, vnless firſt you belieue the Church to be infallible.
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, by the Church, all Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a Congregation of
Faithfull people, capable of ſalvation; and yourſelf teach, that every
errour in Faith, vnrepented, brings damnation. How then can it be ſaied, that
the whole vniverſall Church can erre in Faith? But you doe very
inop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely talk, whether Ours be the Church: ſeing we ſpeak only of the
Church in generall, abſtracting, for the preſent, from that other
Queſtion; though it be euident, that if there were any true Church, which
delivered to Chriſtians the Scripture, and Creed, when Luther appeared, it
muſt be the Roman, and ſuch as agreed with her.</p>
               <p n="12">12. You goe forward and ſay to <hi>Charity Maintayned.
The Apoſtles intention was by your owne confesſion particularly to deliuer
in the Creed ſuch Articles of belief as were fitteſt for thoſe tymes. Now
to deliver par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and to deliver only implicitely, to be delivered
particularly in the Creed and only to be redu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ble to it, I ſuppoſe are repugnances hardly
recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliable.</hi> Anſwer; I know not well, what, nor whom, you can pretend
to impugne. For, <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> never ſaied that there are no Truths,
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly expreſed in the Creed; yea (N. 5. and 8.) he named divers in
particular expreſeb in it, but he only affirmed, that all are not ſo
expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in partilular, but ſome implicitely, others reductiuè,
as he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in thoſe two Numbers. Now, that ſome things ſhould be
delivered <pb n="797" facs="tcp:59214:413"/>particularly, and other ſome only
implicitely, and other only reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely, can be no irreconciliable repugnance,
ſeing in all good Logick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance muſt be in order to the ſame thing;
as it is no repugnance, that one writer, ſhould procede honeſtly, and
ſpeak to the purpoſe, and an other doe quite the contrary.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For anſwer to your (N. 25.26.27.28.29.) I haue
attentively conſidered, and compared with my obſervations, all the
Authorityes, or ſentences, which you alledg out of Catholique Writers, and
find them to containe no difficulty, not precluded and anſwered, by thoſe
obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. And who knowes not, that all Catholiques belieue, that all
declarations of Generall Councells, concerning the Creed (and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points
of Faith) are neceſſarily to be belieued? to ſay nothing of the other
obſervations. But I muſt be ſtill intreating the Reader to reade in
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> his (N. 10.11.12.13.14.15.) which you confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
huddle vp togeather.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In your (N. 30.) you grant as much, as can be
deſired by vs, to proue, that to alledg the Creeds containing all
neceſſary, and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points, is impertinent, to make either both
Catholiques, and Proteſtants, or all Proteſtants, capable of ſalvation,
though they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the Creed, yet differ in other revealed Truths. Thus you
write in order to the (N. 10.) of <hi>Char: Ma: Neither is there any diſcord
betweene this Aſſertion of your doctors, and their holding themſelves
obliged to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve all the Points which the Councell of Trent defines. For
Proteſtants and Papiſts may both hold, that all points of belief
neceſſary to be knowen, and believed are ſummed vp in the Creed: And yet
both the one and the other think themſelves bound to belieue whatſoever
other points they either know or belieue to be revealed by God. For the
Articles which are neceſſary to be knowen, that they are revealed by God,
may be very few; and yet thoſe which are neceſſary to be believed, when
they are revealed and knowen to be ſo, may be very many.</hi> Theſe words
ſhew, that Proreſtants do but delude poore ſoules, when they tell them,
that all Proteſtants haue the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Faith, becauſe they belieue
the Creed; when in the meane tyme, they diſagree in other points revealed by
God; and yourſelf ſay els where, that, as things now ſtand, there is the
like neceſſity, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue all points contained in Scripture, as well not
Fundamentall, as Fundamentall. And therfore it can litle availe Proteſtants,
to agree in the Creed, which yet they do not, if we regard the ſenſe, and
not the meere ſound of the words while, they diſagree, in ſo many other 
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:59214:414"/>points belonging to Faith. The Truth is; This grant, and
declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yours, might well haue freed me, from anſwering all the
reſt which you haue in this Chapter; and whatſoever els you proue, or
diſproue, cannot be againſt the ſubſtance, of that, which <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> affirmed in his fourth Chapter, which treates this Queſtion
about the Creed.</p>
               <p n="15">15. You pretend in your (N. 31.) to anſwer the (N. 11.)
of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> but you omitt his diſcourſe about the
Decalogue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, to ſhew a ſimili, or paritate, that it is
not neceſſary, that the Creed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine all neceſſary points, ſeing
what is not expreſſed in it, may be knowen by other meanes. It will not be
amiss, to ſet downe the words of <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> which are: Who is ignorant
that Summaries, Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mees, and the like briefe Abſtracts, are not intended
to ſpecify all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of that ſcience, or ſubject to which they
belong? For as the Creed is ſayd to containe all points of Faith, ſo the
decalogue compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all Articles, as I may terme them, which concerne
Charity, and good life: and yet this cannot be ſo vnderſtood, as if we were
disobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from performance of any duty, or the eſchewing of any vice,
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be expreſſed in the ten Commandements. For (to omitt the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of receaving Sacraments, which belong to practiſe, or manners, and
yet are not contained in the Decalogue) there are many ſinnes, even againſt
the Law of nature, and light of reaſon, which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ten
Commandements, except only by ſimilitude, analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, reduction, or ſome
ſuch way. For example; we find not expreſſed in the Decalogue, either
divers ſinnes, as Gluttony, Drunkenneſſe, Pride, Sloth, Covetouſnes in
deſiring either things ſuperfluous, or with too much greedines; or divers
of our chiefe obligations, as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to princes, and all ſuperiours, not
only Eccleſiaſticall, but alſo Civill. And the many Treatiſes of
Civilians, Canoniſts, and Caſuiſts are witneſſes, that divers
ſinnes againſt the light of Reaſon, and Law of nature, are not
diſtinctly expreſſed in the ten commandements; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, when by other
diligences they are found to be vnlawfull, they may be reduced to ſome of the
commandements, and yet not ſo evidently, and particularly, but that divers
doe it in divers manners. Thus farr <hi>Charity Maintayned.</hi> Of all this
you thought ſit to take no notice, but only cavill at his words: <hi>(That
Summaries, Epitomees, and the like briefe Abſtractes, are not intended to
ſpecify all particulars of that Science, or ſubject, to which they
belong)</hi> againſt which you reply: <hi>Yes, <pb n="799" facs="tcp:59214:414"/>if they
be intended for perfect Summaries, they muſt not omitt any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Doctrine of that Science wherof they are Summaries.</hi> Anſwer; the Creed is
a perfect ſummarie, of thoſe Truths, which the Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to
deliver therin. Now for you to ſuppoſe, that their purpoſe, was to
expreſſe all neceſſary points of Faith, is to begg the Queſtion, in
ſtead of anſwering the Argument of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> about the
Decalogue of commandements; though ſtill I grant, that the Creed containes
all neceſſary points of Faith, in that ſenſe, which I explicated in my
Obſervations.</p>
               <p n="16">16. All that you haue (N. 32.33.34.35.36.37.38.) makes
nothing againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> but confirmes
it, becauſe you confeſſe, that defacto, there are many points
neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which belong not immediatly to practice: from
whence it followes evidently, that Proteſtants doe but coſen poore people,
in alledging the Creed to that purpoſe, for which they make vſe or it, as I
ſayd. And beſides, ſeeing the particular points, which <hi>Charity
Maintaymed</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies (N. 14.) are either neceſſary to be believed
by every particular perſon, or at leaſt by the whole Church, which cannot
erre in ſuch points, we muſt ſay, the Creed doth not containe all
neceſſary Articles of beliefe. Morover you cannot be ſure, but that of
thoſe many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant points, which <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſhewes not
to be contained in the Creed, ſome are fundamentall; ſeing you
confeſſe, that you cannot tell, which points in particular be fundamentall;
and ſo, for ought you know, they are fundamentall. I obſerue, that you make
mention of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular points, touched by <hi>Charity Mairtayned,</hi>
but omit that of Originall ſinne, becauſe you doe not belieue it; and yet
<hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> (N. 9.) told you, that S. Auſtine (de Pec. Orig.
Cont. Pelag. L. 2 Chap. 22.) teacheth, that it belongs to the foundation of
Faith. Laſtly and Chiefly; ſince the Creed alone without the Tradition and
decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Church, cannot giue vs the true ſenſe of itſelfe, and
that in every one of its Articles, are implied divers points not expreſſed,
which were afterwards declared by Generall Councels, and which all are obliged
to belieue; it followes, that even for thoſe articles, which you call
credenda, the Creed is not ſufficient of itſelfe: To ſay nothing that for
the maine point Dr. Potter, and you, yield vs as much as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to wit,
that the Creed containes not all Fundamentall points of Faith, as Faith directs
our manners, and practice; and ſo whatſoever you ſay of points meerely
ſpeculatiue, imports little, for the maine <pb n="800" facs="tcp:59214:415"/>Subſtance,
of clearing Proteſtants from falſhood, and impertinency, in alledging the
Creed, as they are wont to doe; as if all were done, which is required to
Chriſtians for matter of their vnderſtanding, and beliefe, if they giue
aſſent to the Creed, though they differ in other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith which
direct our lives.</p>
               <p n="17">17. In your (N, 35. and 36.) you make a floriſh about
the Doctrine of Merit, which is not a ſubject to be handled in this place,
wherof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may find excellent Treatiſes, in many Catholik Writers.
On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſay, 1. That it is certaine Proteſtants haue alwayes ſuppoſed,
that they differ from vs in this point, and therfor that our diſagreement is
in that Fundamentall point, that God is a Remunerator, as S. Paul ſaith, and
to this end only, <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> mentioned this point of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
not to impugne the doctrine of Proteſtants, in this place, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for your
diſcourſe of this matter, is plainly impertinent. 2. That you doe not, or
at leaſt, will not vnderſtand rightly, our Catholik Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Merit,
which requires, both habituall grace, and particular motion of the Holy
Ghoſt, who therfor rewards his owne Gifts; and you wrong vs in ſaying, we
make God a rewarder only, and not a giver. For this cauſe we acknowledge our
workes, of themſelves, or of their owne nature, to haue no proportion, with
Grace, and Glory; and that by duty, we are obliged to ſerue God, as farr as
he commands vs; which hinders not, but that, by his Grace, this very ſerving
him, may be meritorious; a duty, and yet a deſerving; as the ſervant merits
a reward for the workes, which he is obliged to doe; which is much more
evident, ſeing de facto, God hath not commanded, all that he might haue
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of vs in rigour. 3. As elſe where, ſo here you take vpon you, to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the doctrine of Proteſtants, about merit, without any commiſſion
from them, who are ſo divived among themſelves, that it is impoſſible
for you, to ſpeake as you thinke in behalfe of them all, without putting
yourſelfe, to maintaine contradictions. For, how can they pretend to any
Merit, or Obedience, who teach, that it is impoſſible to keepe the
Commandements; that all our workes are deadly ſinnes; that we haue no free
will, and the like? 4. That you bring the very ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the
merit of Juſt men, which your friend Uolkelius (de Uer. Relig. Lib. 5. Chap:
20.) vrges againſt the Merit of our Bleſſed Saviour; and therfore
Engliſh Proteſtants, who, againſt you Socinians, belieue that Chriſt
merited, and ſatiſfied for mankind, muſt anſwer your objections
againſt vs.</p>

               <p n="18">18. To your (N. 39.) I ſay: whoſoever conſiders the

an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is impoſſible, that they, who agree in points
<hi>receyvea in the whole Chriſtian world,</hi> and yet diſagree in any
point of Faith, be it never ſo ſmall, can with ſuch a beliefe joyne holy

confeſſe, damnable in it ſelfe, to hold any errour, againſt
whatſoever revealed Truth: And ſo your diſcourſe, in the beginning of
your next (N. 40.) falls to the ground; it being impoſſible, that agreement
in Fundamentall points only, can joyne men in one communion of Faith, while
they ſo differ in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as one ſide muſt be in a damnable

diſcourſe, and grounds, divers Articles of Chriſtian Faith may be
caſſiered and caſt out of the Church; and he finds ſo much matter
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctor, as it is no wonder, if he in his ſhort examination,
tooke no notice, of the contradiction, which <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi>
touches, as he <hi>(Charity Maintayned)</hi> takes not notice, of all the
advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, or other contradictions, which perhaps he might haue found, and
which Paulus Ueridicus obſerves; but that was not the ayme of <hi>Ch:
Ma:</hi> in his anſwer to Potter.</p>
               <p n="20">20. In your (N. 46.) you ſay, <hi>There is no
contradiction, that the ſame man, at the ſame time, ſhould belieue
contradictions.</hi> Which (N. 47.) you declare, or temper, in this manner:
<hi>Indeed that men ſhould not aſſent to contradictions, and that it is
vnreaſonable to doe ſoe I willingly grant. But to ſay it is impoſsible
to be done, is againſt every mans experience, and almoſt as vnreaſonable,
as to doe the thing, which is ſaied to be impoſsible. For though perhaps it
may be very difficult, for a man in his right wits, to belieue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
expreſſed in termes, eſpecially if he belieue it to be a contradiction,
yet for men being cowed and awed by ſuperſtition, to perſwade
themſelves vpon ſlight and triviall grounds, that theſe, or theſe,
though they ſeeme contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet indeed are not ſo, and ſo to
belieue them: or if the plaine repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of them be veiled and diſguiſed
a little, with ſome empty vnintelligible non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe diſtinction; or if
it be not expreſt, but implyed, not direct, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, ſo that
the parties, to whoſe Faith the propoſitions are offered, are either
innocently, or perhaps affectedly ignorant of the contrariety of them 
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:59214:417"/>for men in ſuch caſes eaſily to ſwallow and
digeſt contradictions, he that denies it poſsible, muſt be a meer
ſtranger in the world.</hi> Thus you; after your faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hion, involuing things
in obſcurity, that one cannot penetrate what you would ſay, but that you
may haue an evaſion againſt whatſoever may be obſected. As for the
thing it ſelfe; There is no doubt, but that men may belieue things, which in
themſelves are contradictions; wherof we need no other proofe, then to
ſhew, that it happeneth ſo to yourſelfe, if you belieue what you affirme,
even in this matter, wherin I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to be implied plaine
contradiction. But when men ſay with one voyce, that we cannot aſſent to
contradictions, it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, if they be apprehended as ſuch;
and therfore it might ſeeme need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, to ſpend many words in
confutation of this hereſie, as I may call it, againſt the firſt
principle of Reaſon. Yet becauſe, your reaſons may perhaps ſeeme to
ſome, to proue more; ſince even in your explication or modification, you
ſaie only (perhaps) and (may be) of that which all the world holds for
certaine, and for the ground of all certainty in humane Reaſon; and
becauſe, if they be well conſidered, they ſtrike at the ſublime
myſteries of Chriſtian Religion; and, in regard, this is an age of
Academiks, and Sceptiks, who willingly put all things to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, wherby,
vnder pretence of freedome in Reaſon, they take liberty againſt Religion;
as alſo to ſhew, how little reaſon you had, to take this vaine occaſion
of a fond flouriſh, to ſhew a Socinian wit; and laſtly, becauſe by this
occaſion I may examine ſome other points, I will both confute your
reaſons, and ſhew that you contradict yourſelfe.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Only I cannot for beare to reflect, how he, who
reſolves Faith into Reaſon, ſo much extold by him, that he relyes theron,
as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks doe vpon the infallibility of Gods Church, or Calviniſts vpon
the private ſpirit, or on the Grace of God, which both Catholiks, and
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants againſt Pelagius, belieue to be neceſſary, for every Act
of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, how, I ſay, this man, doth now, ſo extenvate Reaſon,
that if it indeed were ſo miſerable and fooliſh, as he makes it, we might
better belieue our dreames, than our reaſon: wherby he deſtroies all that
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe builds vpon Reaſon, and conſequently Faith it ſelfe, which in
his principles, muſt be reſolved into Reaſon: juſt as I ſayd
hertofore, that although he ſeeme in words, to extoll Scripture, as a Perfect
Rule; the only ground of our Faith, containing evidently all neceſſary
points, and the like; yet indeed, by his wicked Tenets concerning it, he
deprives it of all authority, and makes it vnable, to deliver vs any thing,
with <pb n="804" facs="tcp:59214:418"/>abſolute certainty. A juſt judgment of God, to
bring provd men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and intrap them in their owne ſnares, and
proue their wiſdome to be but fooliſhness, even by croſſing, and
contradicting themſelves, and overthrowing the maine foundations of their
pretended friends, or clients, as this man deſtroyes the maine ground, of
Socinians, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and the only Rule of Proteſtants, Scripture! If
contradictions may be true, you, or any other may write Books with much
ſecurity, and without feare of being confuted. For when you are brought to
the hard exigent of acknowledging contradictions, your anſwer will be, that
one may aſſent to contradictions, and ſo one, by all his paines taken to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute you, ſhall only proue, what you grant and ſeeke to proue. And in
particular, it will be impoſſible to confute the Reaſons, whereby you
endeavour to proue this your aſſertion; becauſe whatſoever is alledged,
can inferr no greater abſurdity, than that which you grant, that
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictoryes may be true. And on the other ſide, it will not be in your
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to confute any man; ſeing the moſt you can doe, will be to driue him
vnto contradictions, which he (being taught by you) will ſay, is no
abſurdity: and ſo all will be at a ſtand, and become ſilent
diſputants: And it may be true, that euen this your aſſertion
(contradictions may be true) may be ſaied both to be true, and fals, or not
true. And by what Logick can you, or any who holds this Doctrine be confuted?
Not oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiuè, as Logicians ſpeak; becauſe this is primum
principium of all other; nor deducendo ad abſurdum, or impoſſible,
ſeing the greateſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, that one can be brought to, is that which
you grant. And there fore <hi>Chriſtianity maintayned,</hi> (Pag: 62.)
ſaied truly, that your Reaſons, if you hold them for good, muſt proue the
contrary of that which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that is, your proofes that we may
aſſent to contradictions, muſt ſuppoſe, that we cannot aſſent to
them: which if you do not ſuppoſe, you will never be able to convince any
man, in any thing. Beſides, if your Reaſons proue any thing, they proue,
that one may aſſent to formall contradictions, which yet you pretend to
deny, and therefore even in this reſpect, you in fact hold contradictions.
But let vs heare your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Your firſt, is this: <hi>Whatſoever a man
believes true, that he may and muſt belieue; But there haue bene ſome who
haue believen and taught, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions might be true, againſt whom
Ariſtoile diſputes in the third of his Metaphyſicks; Therefore it is not
impoſsible that a man may belieue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="805" facs="tcp:59214:418"/>
               <p n="23">23. Anſwer: 1. We haue heard you ſaying (N. 47.)
<hi>Perhaps it may be very difficult, for a man in his right wits, to belieue a
contradiction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in termes, eſpecially if he belieue it to be a
contradiction.</hi> Now I ask, whether thoſe men whom Ariſtotle impugnes
were in their right wits, or no? If they were; Then your Argument, if it proue
any thing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves that it is poſſible for men in their right wits, to
belieue contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons expreſſed in termes (for Ariſtotle ſpeaks of
ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictions.) And then how do you ſay; It is difficult for a man in
his right wits to belieue a contradiction? Seing in our caſe, it is all one
to be difficult, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, ſince that which the light of reaſon,
tells vs, is, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and not only difficult, and if you
deny it to be impoſſible you will not be able to proue it difficult;
neither did they whom Ariſtotle impugnes, make any diſtinction, between
being difficult, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. So that this parte of the Anſwer to my
Dilemma, which ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thoſe men to be in their wits, doth indeed put
them our of their wits; becauſe according to your owne doctrine, they could
not aſſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, if they were in their wits. But if thoſe
men were out of their wits; ſurely you ought not to take mad men for
Maiſters in Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks; which is no better than to ſuborne ſleeping
witneſſes, as the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes did, againſt our Saviours reſurrection, and as
you doe, to proue your chimericall Aſſertion. 2. If you belieue, that one
may belieue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, how will you proue this conſequence; ſome haue
believed, and taught, that contradictions might be true; Therfore he may and
muſt belieue contradictions. If you ſay; It implies contradictions, that
one ſhould belieue a thing to be true, and yet that it is impoſſible for
him to aſſent to it: it will be anſwered; what then? Do you not
ſuppoſe, and teach, even this which in this anſwer you take to be
abſurd, that one may aſſent to contradictions; will you haue it
poſſible that one may aſſent to contradictions, when you affirme it,
and not poſſible, when an other ſayes the ſame? 3. If any ſaied, and
believed, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions might be true, they erred againſt the firſt
and moſt knowne Principle of nature, and ſo, as you inferr; Contradictoryes
were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be true, therfore they might be believed to be true; I take
the contrary truth; It is knowne by the light of nature, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories
cannot be true, and infer; Therefore it is impoſſible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them,
being conceived to be Contradictoryes, if men be in theyr wits. If you conceyue
Ariſtotle, did ſufficiently confute thoſe men, why do you alledg theyr
confeſſed fals doctrine, to proue that which <pb n="806" facs="tcp:59214:419"/>you
pretend to be true? Certainly this is neither an honeſt kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
nor a good way of proving. If your opinion be, that he did not refell them
effectually; without doubt, it had bene a Work, beſeeming your wit, to haue
confuted Ariſtotle, and defended thoſe men, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe doctrine vnless you
maintaye, your Argument taken from theyr conceypts, can be of no force at all.
Neither had it bene needfull for you, to haue ſtudied, what Title had bene
fitteſt for ſuch a Work. For, you might haue remembred, that Simon Magus is
ſaied to haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Books, which he called Contradictorios. (Uid. Baron.
Ann. Chriſti 35. N. 23.) A Title moſt agreable to your genius, both
becauſe in this place you expreſſly defend Contradictions, and in regard,
that through your whole Booke, you do indeed fall into them, more frequently,
than I could haue imagined. Yet as for thoſe men whom Ariſtotle impugnes,
it is one thing, that they ſaied, they believed Contradictions might be true,
and an other that indeed they could belieue them, if they were in their right
wits, and vnderſtood what were true contradictories. In which reſpect
Ariſtotle Metaphys: (Lib: 4. Cap: 3.) ſaieth: Nonenim neceſſe eſt,
quaecumque quis dicat, ea etiam putare. But this is not the firſt tyme, that
you confound the firſt, and ſecond operation of the vnderſtanding, or
primam apprehenſionem, and judicium. Never the less if you be ſetled in a
reſolution to defend that men being out of their right wits may belieue
Contradictories, I ſay, it imports nothing for our preſent purpoſe,
ſeing I hope you will not ſay, that the fact of ſuch men can concerne Dr.
Vſher, to whom <hi>Cha: Ma:</hi> objected, that ſome words of his did
implie a contradiction. Laſtly, be pleaſed to reflect, that Ariſtotle
ſpeakes of express and knowen Contradictions, and yourſelf confess, that it
is difficult, and men ought not to belieue ſuch, and therfore this firſt
Reaſon of yours proves either too much, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, and ſo proves
nothing at all, becauſe it proves too much. And I wonder how you ſay in
your (N. 46. Pag: 215.) <hi>Though there can be no damnable Hereſie, vnless
it contradict ſome neceſſary Truth, yet there is no Contradiction but the
ſame man may at once belieue this Hereſie and this Truth; becauſe there
is no Contradiction that the ſame man at the ſame tyme, ſhould belieue
Contradictions.</hi> Let vs ſuppoſe this to be, as it is, a damnable
Hereſie; Chriſt is not the Saviour of the world; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory is:
Chriſt is the Saviour of the world, which is a formall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and
expreſſed in termes, to which it ſeeemes by theſe words you may
aſſent, and conſequently to express contradictions, which 
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:59214:419"/>yet (N. 47.) you are forced to moderate. But when you
ſay; <hi>There is no contradiction but the ſame man may at once belieue
this Hereſie and this Truth,</hi> and add this reaſon, or proofe
<hi>becauſe there is no contradiction, that the ſame man at the ſame time
ſhould belieue contradictions,</hi> you muſt giue me leaue to ſpeak a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
ſay, that you vtter plaine non-ſenſe, (yourſelf talk of ſome
non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe diſtinction) in proving that one may belieue contradictions,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no contradiction, that one belieue contradictions, which
cauſall ſuppoſes, that we could not belieue them, if it were a
contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to belieue them; and conſequently, that we cannot belieue
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions; and yet in this very ſentence, you ſay; <hi>There is no
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction but the ſame man, at the ſame time ſhould belieue
contradictions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. Your ſecond reaſon is delivered in theſe words:
<hi>They which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue there is no certainty in reaſon, muſt belieue that
contradictions may be true: For otherwiſe there will be certainty in this
Reaſon; This contradicts Truth, therefore it is fals. But there be now divers
in the world who belieue there is no certainty in reaſon: Therefore there be
divers in the world who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue contradictions may be true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. Anſwer; 1. Certainly if there be any certainty in
Reaſon, it is in this; that contradictions cannot be true; and ſeing you
hold this not only not certainly true, but to be falſe, it is cleare, that
you are one of thoſe, who belieue there is no certainty in Reaſon; and
conſequently, you cannot be certaine, even of your owne Aſſertion, that
contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be true. And ſo while you draw an Argument, from thoſe
who belieue there is no certainty in Reaſon, you depriue your owne
Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all certainty. 2. If once you ſwallow that abſurdity, of
the truth of contradictoryes, when you ſay: <hi>This Contradicts truth,
therefor it is fals,</hi> the anſwer might be; that it might contradict
truth, and yet not be fals, but true; becauſe contradictions may be true. And
I beſeech you tell vs; whether you belieue, that whatſoever contradicts
truth, is fals: If you ſay it is not fals, you ſpeak abſurdly. For what
is falſhood but an errour againſt truth? If you ſay, it muſt be fals,
you overthrow your owne Doctrine, that contradictions may be true; becauſe in
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions one parte muſt be oppoſite to a truth, and conſequently
fals. 3. That conceypt, that there is no certainty in Reaſon, being fals and
injurious to mankind, you cannot ground on it any truth, except this; that it
is a very fitt Principle for your abſurd Concluſion, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictoryes
may be true, and that, if you belieue it to be true, you are in apernicious
errour: If you hold it to be fals; why do you vrge it againſt 
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:59214:420"/>vs this Sceptick doctrine? 4. Your Argument proves, that
one may aſſent not only to contradictories, not perceived to be ſuch, but
to them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in plaine termes; becauſe otherwiſe there would be
certainty in this Reaſon; Theſe be express contradictoryes; Therefore they
cannot both be true. Thus ſtill your Reaſons, either proue nothing at all,
or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſelf.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Your third Reaſon. is: <hi>They which do captivate
their vnderſtandings to the belief of thoſe things which to their
vnderſtanding ſeeme irreconciliable contradictions, may as well belieue
reall contradictions: (For the difficulty of believing ariſes not from their
being repugnant, but for their ſeeming to be ſo) But you do captivate your
vnderſtandings to the belief of thoſe things which ſeeme to your
vnderſtandings irreconciliable contradictions, Therefore it is as poſsible
and eaſy for you to belieue thoſe that indeed are ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27. Anſwer: 1. What is this but to vndermine
Chriſtian Religion, wherin we ſubmit and captivate our vnderſtandings to
Myſteryes, which to humane reaſon ſeeme impoſſible, and for that very
cauſe we are taught to captivate our vnderſtanding to the obedience of
Chriſt? And now you tell all Chriſtians, that by doing ſo, they belieue
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions as well as if they believed reall contradictions, which Jewes,
Turks, Pagans, and all men in their right wits know to be abſurd, and
impoſſible, and you confess to be vnreaſonable, and very difficult,
ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of express contradictions; as heere you ſpeak of ſuch; ſince
you expreſſly ſpeak of things, which to ones <hi>vnderſtanding ſeeme
irreconciliable contradictions.</hi> I deſire the Reader to looke vpon
<hi>Chr: Ma:</hi> (Chap. 9.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter. 2. Therefor, as in other
Reaſons, ſo in this, ſeing you ſpeak of contradictions expreſſed in
termes, you contradict what yourſelf afterward (N. 47.) teach. 3. The
neceſſity that all Chriſtians acknowledg of ſubmitting our
vnderſtanding to Faith, ariſes from this, that they ſeeme to containe
contradictions; which could be no reaſon requiring the captivating our
Reaſon, if they did not ſuppoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions cannot bettue; and
therefore this very reaſon, which you bring to proue, that men may belieue
contradictions, muſt ſuppoſe, they cannot belieue them. For if they
could, it would coſt them litle to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that which to them ſeemed a
contradiction. 4. You ſay, <hi>It is as poſsible and as eaſy for vs to
belieue thoſe things that indeed</hi> are reall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, <hi>as to
belieue thoſe things which to our vnaerſtanding ſeeme
contradictions:</hi> which words ſuppoſe that it is both poſſible, and
eaſy for vs to belieue thoſe things which to vs ſeeme contradictions; and
yet <pb n="809" facs="tcp:59214:420"/>(N. 47.) you ſay; it is <hi>very difficult</hi> for
a man in his right wits to belieue express contradictions. Into how many
contradictions, do you fall, while you treate of conradictions? 5. Your
Argument ſcarcely deſerves any Anſwer. For who is ignorant, that
contradiction muſt involue two ſides, one affirming, the other denying; and
therefore when one, allthings conſidered, believes one parte only, he is ſo
farre from believing things which to his vnderſtanding ſeeme
contradictions, that he is certaine, not to belieue contradictions; becauſe
he ſees, that he believes one parte only of the contradiction, and rejects
the other, and is alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that, as I ſaied, contradiction muſt
involue two parts. And heere I would demand, wherher you belieue indeed, that
contradictions can be true? If you belieue they may be true, then Chriſtian
Religion may teach; Scripture may contayne; God may reveale, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d muſt
aſſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, ſeing he cannot but aſſent to all truth.
And are not theſe blaſphemyes? If you belieue, contradictions cannot be
true; how will you haue it poſſible for any man to belieue that, which he
believes not to be true? You ſaied in your firſt Reaſon, <hi>Whatſoever
a man believes true that he may and muſt belieue:</hi> And certainly, I may
better ſay: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man believes, nor to be true; that he neither
may, nor can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue: and therfore ſeing all men in their right wits,
belieue that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictoryes cannot be true, it is impoſſible that they
ſhould belieue them. But let vs procede to your</p>
               <p n="28">28. Fourth Reaſon. <hi>Some men,</hi> ſay you,
<hi>may be confuted in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and perſwaded out of them; but no mans
errour can be confuted, who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his errour doth not belieue and
grant ſome true principle that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts his errour: For nothing can be
proved to him who grants nothing, neither can there be (as all men know) any
rationall diſcourſe but out of grounds agreed on by both parts. Therefore
it is not impoſsible but abſolutely certaine, that the ſame man at the
ſame time may belieue contradictions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29. Anſwer. Firſt: If it were lawfull to vſe ſuch
an expreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it might well, be ſaied, that it ſeemes fatall for you,
to be at variance with your ſelf. For, I pray you ſuppoſe one to belieue,
that contradictions may be true: How will you perſwade him out of his errour?
By ſhewing him, that he grants ſome true principle that contradicts his
errour? But if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories may be true, and one may at the ſame time
belieue them, nothing will force him to leaue his errour, though it appeare to
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict ſome principle which he grants, becauſe he may belieue both his
ſuppoſed errous, and that principle to betrue; yea he neede not beleeue it
to be an errour though it contradict ſome true principle, ſeing both 
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:59214:421"/>parts of contradictories may be true. Chuſe, which you
pleaſe. May contradictories be true, or be believed, or no? If they may; then
this Reaſon of yours proves nothing, as I haue ſhewed. Can they not be
true, nor be believed? then, to make good this Reaſon, you denie that for
which you alledg it; and muſt ſay that one cannot at the ſame tyme
belieue contradictions; and that if he could do ſo, this Reaſon were of no
force. A new kind of Logick, to bring a Reaſon, to proue a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which muſt be fals, if the Reaſon, or Proofe for it be of any force? That
is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o proue that
contradictions may be believed, you vſe an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which (to haue any
force) muſt ſuppoſe they may not be believed. How will you driue one from
that which he believes, by propoſing a principle which even by your doctrine,
he conceyves may conſiſt with that from which you would driue him? So,
ſtill that which I ſaied is true, That your Arguments, if they proue any
thing, muſt ſuppoſe, or proue, the direct contrary of that which you
intend to proue by them, and ſo not help, but overthrow yourſelf. Secondly;
If your Reaſon be of any force, it can only proue, that by ignorance, one may
hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictoryes, which was needless to be proved, it being a thing which
no man denyes. And then, you muſt either acknowledg a contradiction, or els
acknowledg, that you intended to proue, that one may aſſent to express and
knowen contradictions, but that your Reaſon proved not ſo much, as you did
meane to proue by it. For, if your purpoſe was only to proue a
poſſibility of aſſenting to contradictoryes, not knowen to be ſuch,
you contradict yourſelf, in ſaying (N. 47.) <hi>Men ſhould not aſſent
to contradictions, and that it is vnreaſonable to doe ſo;</hi> ſeing it
is evident, in caſe of probable, or invincible ignorance, a man may, and
ought to belieue them, and it were vnreaſonable to doe that which all the
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that he can conſider, tell him, that he is to doe as he does, and
that it is not in his power to diſcover his errour by any reaſons, that can
repreſent themſelves to his vnderſtanding. It cannot be denyed but in
that caſe he proceedes prudently, and ſafely, and therefore not
vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, but as he ſhould doe: and yourſelf confess, that men may
inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently (as you ſpeak) be ignorant of the contradiction. Yourſelf tell
vs in your next Reaſon, that we cannot <hi>without extream madneſſe, and
vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſſe, deny, that you belieue the Bible,</hi> and yet we
belieue that ſome part of your doctrine contradicts the Bible. Now ſeing
this laſt is certaine by evident experience of Proteſtants, who interpret
Scripture ſo, as what one affirmes, an other denyes to be the meaning
thereof, you muſt <pb n="811" facs="tcp:59214:421"/>either grant, that men may rationally
belieue that kind of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of which we ſpeak, or els with extreame
madness, and vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness ſay, that no Proteſtant who contradicts an
other about the ſenſe of Scripture, does as he ſhould doe, but is
vnreaſonable in ſo doing. Chuſe then, (I returne to ſay,) whether you
will ſay, your meaning was in this fourth Reaſon, to ſpeak of express
contradictions, and confess that it comes not home to that purpoſe; or els
that you ſpoke not of ſuch express contradictions; and confess that in this
(N. 46.) you contradict your (N. 47.) wherein you ſay, One <hi>ſhould not
belieue contradictions, and that it is vnreaſonable to doe ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">30. Your Fifth Reaſon we haue mentioned already, That
Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants belieue all that is in the Bible to be true, and yet we ſay,
that they belieue divers Doctrines againſt the Bible, and conſequently that
they belieue Contradictions. But ſeing this Reaſon, if it proue any thing,
proues only, that men may aſſent to Contradictions not knowen to be ſuch,
it is already anſwered, and confuted, and demonſtrated, to be guilty either
of inſufficiency, or to ſubſiſt by a manifeſt Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to that,
for which you alledg it; as I a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered to your fourth Reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Your Sixth Reaſon, is equally full of impiety,
malice, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: and is anſwered in a word, That we abſolutely are
certaine, there is implied no Contradiction in the Doctrine of
Tranſubſtantiation, and therfore it cannot ſerue to proue that men may
belieue Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And ſeing it ſpeaks only of Contradictions, not
expreſſed in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, but only involved, it is liable to all the ſame
exceptions, which I haue declared againſt your Fourth, and Fifth Reaſon.
Neither can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny expect, or even indure, that heere I ſhould write a Book of
Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. You know learned Catholike Writers, haue anſwered,
all that can be objected againſt vs, in that Myſtery; and you ſhould haue
brought as well theyr anſwers, as your owne objections, if your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had bene to declare the Truth, and not only to be blaſphemous. But ſtill
you declare, more and more, that you vndermine Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; it being
evident to any, who is not ignorant of Phyloſophy, that whoſoever denyes
the poſſibility of Tranſubſtantiation, will much more deny other
Myſteryes of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Religion as in particular the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity,
and Incarnation of the Son of God, as ſhewed concerning the B. Trinity, out
of Dr. Taylor, and by your owne Confeſſion. Who can deny that one Body may
be in two places, or two bodyes in one; or accidents remayne, without
ſubſtance, or Subject; if he belieue, that <pb n="812" facs="tcp:59214:422"/>one
individuall Eſſence of God is in three Perſons (in the B. Trinity) and in
the Incarnation two complete Natures, Divine and humane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in one
Perſon, and a complete ſubſtance (the Humane Nature of our Saviour
Chriſt) not ſubſiſt by itſelf, but by the ſubſiſtence of the
ſecond Perſon, it being no more ſtrang, or difficult, that, an accident
ſhould not exiſt in alio, than that a complete ſubſtance ſhould not
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtere per ſe; and farre more vnintelligible, that one Nature
ſhould be in three perſons, or two natures in one perſon, then that one
Body ſhould be in diverſe places; there being a more ſtrict connection
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Nature, and Hypoſtaſis, than betweene a Body, and a place. But
your concluſion of the (N. 46.) is ſo patently injurious to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, that it is intollerable. You ſay to <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> If you can not
compoſe the repugnance of points implied in Tranſubſtantiation <hi>and
that after an intelligible manner, then you muſt giue me leaue to belieue,
that either you doe not belieue Tranſubſtantiation, or els that it is no
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that men ſhould ſubjugate their vnderſtanding to the

arguments, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt the Bleſſed Trinity, Incarnation, and other
ſublime myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teryes of Chriſtian Religion, and compoſe all ſeeming
repugnance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an intelligible manner, otherwiſe than by finally
captivating our vnderſtanding, to the obedience of ſaith? And if you will
not be content without all be declared in an intelligible manner, is it not
Hypocriſie in you to ſay (pag: 376. N 56.) of Scripture? <hi>Propoſe me
any thing out of this Book, and require whether I belieue it or no, and ſeeme
it never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprhenſsible to Human Reaſon, I will ſubſcribe it
with hand and hart.</hi> For, ſeing you belieue Chriſtian Religion, only
with a probable aſſent for Humane prudentiall Motives; how can Myſteryes
ſeeming incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, and repugnant, to human Reaſon, be declared
not to be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, after an intelligible manner a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d why ſhould not a

heere againe I deſire you to reflect on your ſaying; <hi>That it is no
Contradiction, that men ſhould ſubjugate their vnderſtandings to the
belief of Contradictions;</hi> Is not this to ſay; that if it were a
contradiction, to ſubjugate our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to contradictions, we could
not doe it? And yet you teach that we may belieue contradictions, and
conſequently you ſhould ſay; though it be a contradiction, to ſubjugate
our vnderſtandings to contradictions, yet we may doe it, becauſe we may
belieue contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <pb n="813" facs="tcp:59214:422"/>and ſo you muſt either deny
that men can belieue contradictions, or els confess that the ſaied ſame
ſentence <hi>(It is no contradiction, that men ſubjugate, their
vnderſtandings to the belief of Contradictions)</hi> deſtroyes it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as I haue ſhewed. And beſides, when you ſay; <hi>It is no Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that &amp;c:</hi> you muſt ſignify, that, to be a contradiction, is to be
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; and that if it were contradiction to belieue contradictions,
it were impoſſible to belieue them: Seing then every one in his right wits
judges it a contradiction, that the ſame thing ſhould be, and not be, at
the ſame tyme; he muſt judg it impoſſible; and if he judge it
impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, he cannot judg it de facto to be ſo; and conſequently,
cannot judg contradictoryes to be true; becauſe it is impoſſible that a
thing be, and not be for the ſame tyme, as all Contradictoryes ſay they

which being once granted, <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> had reaſon to ſay,
that Dr. Vſher did vtter a contradiction, and proved it, by this cleare
reaſon; <hi>That there can be no damnable Hereſy, vnless it contradict
ſome neceſſary Truth, which cannot happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one who is ſuppoſed to

N. 46) <hi>That there can be no damnable Hereſy, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it contradict ſome

contradiction to belieue a damnable Hereſie, and yet belieue all
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Truths, in regard that if he belieue all neceſſary Truths,
he muſt belieue that Truth which is contradictory to that Hereſy, which
alſo he believes, and ſo ſhould belieue two contradictories at the ſame
time. Which belief of (at leaſt implied) contradictions being ſuppoſed,
it is eaſy afterwards to bring one to open contradictions, which you confess
is very difficult, and vnreaſonable (you ſhould ſay impoſſible) for a
man in his right wits to belieue; and ſo you forſake your two Dr. Vſher,
and Potter, in this Aſſertion, which you ſay (N. 47.) <hi>the one
preached and printed, the other reprinted.</hi> Your ſecond anſwer is, that
the latter part of Dr. Vſhers words, is but a repetition of the former. But
this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer deſtroyes the former (which yet you do not deny to be good,
and agreeable to the meaning of the Doctor.) For if the Second part be a
contradiction of the former, as according to your firſt anſwer it is, how
can it be only a repetition therof? And you tooke not a fitt example out of S.
Athanaſius his Creed, to proue a meere repetition; you I ſay, who wickedly
hold that Creed (which indeed is a Catholique profeſſion of the chiefeſt
Articles of Chriſtian Religion to (be but an aggregate of Contradictions: And
yet that explication of S. Athanaſius (Neither confounding the Perſons
&amp;c:) was neceſſary, againſt ſome Hereſies, that gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted a
diſtinction of Perſons, only quoad nomina, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For your
other vulgar examples, to proue that thoſe latter words, may be only a
repetition of the former, you muſt remember, that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, all
ſhew or ſhadow of contradictions, or falſhood muſt be carefully
avoided, as certainly it is a pernicious thing, to giue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
believing, that a damnable Hereſie, may ſtand with the belief of all
neceſſary Articles of Faith (and ſo a formall Heretique may be ſaved)
and nevertheless you do not deny, but that Dr. Vſhers words may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
this. Yet <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> out of this poyſon gathered this
who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lſome doctrine in the ſame (N. 17.) that, <hi>if one believing all
Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <pb n="815" facs="tcp:59214:423"/>Articles in the Creed, may ſuperinduce
damnable hereſies; it followes that the fundamentall truths contrary to
thoſe damnable hereſies, are not contained in the Creed.</hi> And ſo, the
Creed cannot be ſaied, to containe all Points, neceſſary to be believed,
which is the maine Point in hand. You wonder that <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> did nor
eſpie an other contradiction in D. Vſhers words, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke to that which He
noted; but if that other be a contradiction, you ſay it is of the ſame
nature with that which was obſerved, and ſo it had bene to multiply things
without neceſſity. But enough of this, which <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> (N. 17.)
profeſſed to note only by the way, which yet did either trouble you very
much for the difficulty of his argument, or elſe you are willing to take anie
occaſion, of making a vaine ſhew of your skill in Logick, and
Metaphyſick, but with how many contradictions, and little credit to
yourſelfe, I hope the Reader hath ſeene by the confutation of all your
Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="35">35. In your number 48.49. you are highly offended with
<hi>Ch. Ma.,</hi> as if he had ſaid (N. 18.) that Dr. Potter patches vp a
Religion, of men agreeing in ſome few, or one Article of beliefe, that
Chriſt is our Saviour, but for the reſt hold conceipts, plainly
contradictory: which you ſay is a <hi>ſhameleſſe calumny, not only
becauſe D. Potter in this point delivers not his owne judgment, but relates
the opinion of others, M. Hocker and M. Morton, but eſpecially even theſe
men (as they are related by Dr. Potter) to the conſtitution of the very
eſſence of a Church, in the loweſt degree, require not only Faith in
Chriſt Ieſus the Sonne of God, and Saviour of the world, but alſo
ſubmiſsion to his Doctrine in minde and will. Now I beſeech you, Syr,
tell me ingenuouſly, whether the Doctrine of Chriſt may be called without
blaſphemy ſcarcely one point of Faith? Is it not manifeſt to all the
world, that Chriſtians of all Profeſsions agree with one conſent in the
beliefe of all thoſe Bookes of Scripture, which were not doubted of in the
ancient Church, without danger of damnation? And ſo the truths wherin they
agree amount to many millions &amp;c.</hi>

men may be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Church, if they agree in fundamentall
Articles, though they ſhould differ in never ſo many other points: and you
cannot deny this, not only to be true, but the very ground, for which they hold
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be brethren, and capable of ſalvation, notwithſtanding
their differences in matters not fundamentall. From whence it followes, that
although it were granted, that Proteſtants agree in many Points not 
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:59214:424"/>fundamentall, yet this is meerely accidentall, and
nothing againſt the Aſſertion of <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> becauſe if once you
ſuppoſe them to agree in all fundamentalls, and diſagree in all other
Points, they muſt ſtill be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one Church. For in this mattet,
more, or fewer, cannot alter their caſe, ſo they keepe with in the compass
of non-fundamentalls: as contrarily, though they were ſuppoſed to agree in
thoſe many milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which you mention, and in as many millions more as you
may pleaſe to imagine, of points not fundamentall; yet if they differ but in
one fundamentall, they cannot be members of the ſame Church; and ſo your
millions of ſuch points, can availe nothing, either to conſtitute men
members of the ſame Church, or to hinder them from being ſo; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
if you agree in never ſo many ſuch points, it helps you no more, then if
you agreed in none at all, according to the ground, and Doctrine of Potter, and
Model of his Church: and therfor the ſaying of <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> is very true,
who ſpeaks reſervedly, in this manner. 
<q rend="margQuotes">According to this Model of Dr. Potters
foundation, conſiſting in the agreement, of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely one Point of Faith;
what a ſtrange Church would he make, of men concurring in ſome one or few
Articles of beliefe, who yet for the reſt ſhould be holding conceipts
plainly contradictory: ſo patching vp a Religion of men, who agree only in
the Article that Chriſt is our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but for the reſt are like to the
parts of a Chimera, having the head of a man, the neck of a horſe &amp;c.</q>
For there is greater repugnancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene aſſent and diſſent, then
betwene integrall parts, as head, neck &amp;c. Theſe words, if you read them
with attention, doe not affirme what is de facto, but only goe vpon a
ſuppoſition, that is, what a Church he would make, if men agreed only in
fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall points, and for the reſt, ſhould hold conceipts plainly
contradictorie; and therfor he vſeth the word Model, which ſignifies, not
neceſſarily what is, but what would be, if Potter proceeded according to
his owne grounds, taking them for a Model of his building. Thus <hi>Ch:
Ma:</hi> doth not wrong Dr. Potter in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting to him, the opinions of others,
but you miſalledge <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> that you may accuſe him of calumny,
created by yourſelfe.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Secondly I anſwer; if <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> had
ſpoken, not vpon meere ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but by way of affirmation (as he did
not) if he committed any fault, it was, in yielding too much. For indeed
Proteſtants doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, even in that fundamentall point, that
<hi>Chriſt is our Saviour, or in Faith in Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God
and Saviour of the world:</hi> Seing I haue ſhewed in divers occaſions,
that they differ toto genere, in their expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <pb n="817" facs="tcp:59214:424"/>and
beliefe of thoſe Articles; and accordingly, Morton teaches that the Churches
of Arians (who denied our Saviour Chriſt to be God) <hi>are to be accounted
the Church of God, becauſe they doe hold the foundation of the Ghoſpell
which is Faith in Ieſus Chriſt the Sone of God and Saviour of the
world,</hi> as may be ſeene in <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> (Part. 1. Chap. 3. Pag. 103.)
and ſince the beliefe of thoſe Articles, is required to the
<hi>conſticuting of the very eſſence of a Church in the Loweſt
degree,</hi> and they doe not agree in them, it followes, that they doe not
agree in the <hi>very eſſence of a Church, in the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt degree.</hi> As
for Divine Precepts, and Divine Promiſes, which you ſay are clearly
delivered in Scripture, they belong to Agenda, and not to Credenda according to
your diſtinction; and ſo men may agree in them, and diſagree in points of
ſimple belief.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Laſtly: If you had a minde to defend Proteſtants,
you ſhould not alledg their agreement, in ſuch Points as they haue received
from vs, but in thoſe, wherin Luther, and his fellowes forſooke the Faith
of our Church, (with which all true Chriſtian Churches did clearly agee) and
in thoſe, Proteſtants are ſo farre from agreement among themſelves,
that in the chiefeſt matters, divers of the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of them, ſtand
for, vs againſt their pretended Brethren: and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, it is moſt
true, that their agreement is only actuall, and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely accidentall; in regard
that they acknowledg no living, infallible Judge of Controverſyes, to make
them agree, in caſe they ſhould chance to doubt of thoſe points, wherin
they caſually agree, and ſo ſtill in actu primo, they are in a
diſpoſition to diſagree: whereas Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, believing an infallible
Judge, are in a continuall diſpoſition, or a virtuall and potentiall
agreement, even in thoſe things, wherin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons may happen not
to agree: yea thoſe many millions of Truths, which you ſay are contayned in
Scripture, could not, for ought Proteſtants know, be ſo much as one, if
your doctrine were true, that Scripture is not a materiall object of Faith,
which men are obliged to belieue. And yet (ſuch is your inconſtancy, and
ſpirit of contradicting yourſelf) you ſay heere: <hi>is it not manifeſt
to all the world, that Chriſtians of all Profeſsions do agree with one
conſent in the belief of all thoſe Bookes of Scripture, which were not
doubted in the ancient Church without danger of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Nay is it not
apparent, that no man at this time, can without hypocriſy, pretend to belieue
in Chriſt, but of neceſsity he muſt do ſo? Seeing he can haue no
reaſon to belieue in Chriſt, but he muſt haue the ſame to believe the
Scripture.</hi> Sr. If all Chriſtians conſent in the belief of Scripture,
how is not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <pb n="818" facs="tcp:59214:425"/>believed? And if it be believed,
how is it not a materiall object of our belief, or the thing which we belieue?
Nay, you ſay, no man at this tyme can pretend to belieue in Chriſt, but of
neceſſity he muſt belieue the Bookes of Scripture: and ſo you declare,
that if Chriſt be a materiall object of our Faith, the Scripture muſt
alſo be ſuch.</p>
               <p n="39">39. But there remaines yet an other contradiction, no
less manifeſt, and more ſtrange, than this, which I now mentioned. Heere
you ſay expreſly; no man can pretend to belieue in Chriſt, but of
neceſſity he muſt belieue Scripture: and you proue this your
Aſſertion; becauſe <hi>he can haue no reaſon to belieue in Chriſt,
but he muſt haue the ſame to belieue the Scripture;</hi> which proof (to be
of any force) muſt ſuppoſe; that <hi>there is alwaies an equall
neceſsity for the belief of thoſe things, for the belief whereof there is
an equall Reaſon:</hi> Otherwiſe, one might haue the ſame reaſon to
belieue in Scripture, which he hath to belieue in Chriſt, and yet be obliged
to belieue in Chriſt, and not be obliged, nor haue an equall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
to belieue the Scripture, vnder danger of damnation. Is not all this cleare?
Now, I beſeech you remember, what you write, (Pag. 116. N. 159.) where you
treate of this very matter, that is, of the belief of Scripture, and of the
belief of the contents thereof, that is (among other Points) of our belief in
Chriſt; and you endeavour to proue, that <hi>God requires of vs vnder pain of
damnation only to belieue the verities therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and not the Divine
Authority of the Bookes wherein they are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Behold your
Aſſertion, contrary to that which we haue heard you ſay, that the
vndoubted Bookes of Scripture <hi>were not doubted of without danger of
damnation.</hi> But let vs ſee, whether as you contradict yourſelf in your
Aſſertions, you doe not the ſame, in the reaſon you giue for them. You
goe forward in the ſaied (Pag. 116. N. 159.) and ſay: <hi>Not but that it:
were now very ſtrang and vnreaſonable, if a man ſhould belieue the
matters of theſe Bookes, and not the Authority of the Bookes: and therefore
if a man ſhould profeſſe the not believing of theſe, I ſhould haue
reaſon to feare he did not belieue that. But there is not alwaies an equall
neceſsity for the belief whereof there is an equall reaſon.</hi> No? <hi>Is
there not alwaies an equall neceſsity for the beliefe of &amp;c.</hi> How
then did you proue, that men cannot without danger of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doubt of the
Bookes of Scripture, as he cannot doubt of Chriſt; becauſe <hi>he can haue
no reaſon to belieue in Chriſt, but of neceſsity he muſt do ſo,</hi>
that is, belieue the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Yet, this is not all, that heere offers itſelf
about your Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. You ſay, we haue the ſame reaſon to belieue
the vndoubted <pb n="819" facs="tcp:59214:425"/>Bookes of Scripture, which we haue for our
belief in Chriſt. I ſuppoſe you meane vniverſall Tradition, for which
you profess to receiue the Scripture. How then were you obliged to belieue in
Chriſt and teach that Chriſt is a materiall object of our Faith, and yet
that Scripture is not ſuch an object, If vniverſall Tradition, be
ſufficient, to declare an Object to be revealed by God, and the ſame
vniverſall Tr. dition deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to vs Chriſt, and Scripture, it is a
Contradiction to ſay, the one is revealed (and conſequently is a materiall
object of our Faith) and not the other. Or if one be revealed, and not the
other, than you contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict your owne ſaying, that there is the ſame
reaſon for believing them both; ſeing the one hath the Formall reaſon, or
Motiue of Faith, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely divine Revelation, which the other muſt want, if you
will needs deny it to be a Materiall Object of Faith: And I hope to be

                     </gap>rre more bold to diſagree even
in matters of Faith, than Catholique Divines in Queſtions meerely
Philoſophicall, or not determined by the Church.</hi> But <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> had good reaſon. For wheras Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques haue an infallible
meanes to know, what Points belong to Faith, they are Religiouſly carefull,
and circumſpect, not to broach any thing, which may in any remote way, cross
any leaſt Article of Chriſtian Religion; as contrarily, Proteſtants
having no certaine Rule for interpreting Scripture, muſt needs be ſubject
to innumerable, and endless diverſityes of opinions, which therfore they will
eſteeme to be no more than indifferent matters: and ſo you ſay in your
anſwer to the Direction (N. 30.) that <hi>the diſputes of Proteſtants are
touching ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Queſtions of Religion, as may with probability
be diſputed on both ſides.</hi> And what is this, except to diſpute of
probabilityes, as men do in Philoſophy? For this cauſe, I haue ſhewed
heretofore, that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants, ſpeaking of the points wherin they
differ, call them <hi>ſmall matters; Things indifferent; Matters of no great
moment; No great matters; Matters of nothing; Matters not to be much
reſpected; No parte of Faith, but curious nicities.</hi> Which ſhewes, that
Proteſtants, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ak and proceede, with greater liberty, in matters
concerning Faith, than Catholiques doe in Philoſophy call Queſtions, which
they would never handle, if they eſteemed them, to be things ſo
contemptible, as Proteſtants declare, the matters in which they differ, to
be. Beſides <pb n="820" facs="tcp:59214:426"/>this; Catholiques in Queſtions of
Philoſophy, bejond the Direction of Faith, to which all Philoſophy ought to
ſubmitt, haue alſo the light of Reaſon, and evident Principles of
demonſtrations, for their guide; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas the Myſteryes of Faith, being
ſublime, and obſcure, and Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants having no infallible meanes, not to
erre in the interpretation of Scripture, they are left to their owne freedom,
or rather fancy, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more than Catholiques are left to themſelves
in Philoſophicall diſputes, wherin they are reſtrayned, and kept within
compass, both by Divine Faith, and Human Reaſon, ſubjected to Faith. It is
true, when they will defend their defection, and Schiſme, from all Churches,
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant when Luther appeared, they will ſeeme to make great account, of all
points, though they be not Fundamentall; but this very thing, doth indeed giue
them greater freedom, to multiply opinyons, and increaſe diſſentions, not
only with vs, but amongſt themſelves, vpon pretence of piety, and
neceſſity to forſake all errours, either of Catholiques, or
Proteſtants. I know not to what purpoſe you ſay: <hi>Is there not as
great repugnancy betweene your aſſent and diſſent, your affirmation and
negation your Eſt, Eſt, Non, Non, as there is betweene theyrs?</hi> For
this is not the Queſtion, but whether, we doe, or haue the freedom to
diſſent, as much as Proteſtants doe, and haue liberty, to diſagree both
from vs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves; and I haue proved that we haue not: and
then I hope there is not as great repugnancy, betwene our Eſt, Eſt, as
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Eſt, and Non Eſt, of Proteſtants. The reſt of this Number
makes nothing againſt what I haue ſaied, and therfore I Let it pass, though
there want not ſome points, which you could not eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
               <p n="42">42. To your (N. 51.52.) I anſwer; <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi>
ſaied truly, 
<q rend="margQuotes">that while Proteſtants ſtand only
vpon Fundamentall Articles, they do by their owne confeſſion deſtroy the
Church, which is the Houſe of God. For the fundation alone of a houſe, is
not a houſe, nor can they in ſuch an imaginary Church any more expect
ſalvation, than the Fundation alone of a houſe is ſitt to affoard a man,
habitation.</q> To this you ſay to <hi>Charity Maintayned; I hope you will
not be difficult in granting, that that is a houſe, which hath all the
neceſſary parts belonging to a houſe. Now by Fundamentall Articles, we
meane all thoſe which are neceſſary:</hi> Vnless you will ſay <hi>that

againſt Proteſtants, who pretend to Brotherhood, V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Faith, and Hope
of ſalvation, in vertue of their agreement in Fundamentall Articles, though
they differ in many other Points of Faith. This ſtate of the Queſtion being
ſuppoſed, and evidently true;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> you meane (for you ſpeak
very confuſedly, in ſaying only, <hi>By Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Artitles, we meane
all thoſe which are neceſſary</hi>) If I ſay, you meane that
Fundamentall and neceſſary points are the ſame, and that all points
ſufficiently propoſed as revealed by God are neceſſary to be believed
(and conſequently Fundamentall) you fight for <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned,</hi>
and grant, that Proteſtants diſagreeing in points revealed, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in
neceſſary and Fundamentall points, and cannot be of the ſame Church, nor
hope for ſalvation. For you muſt giue me leaue to ſay; <hi>I hope you
will not be difficult in granting that it is</hi> not a houſe, or a Church
which hath not all the neceſſary things belonging to a houſe, or church.
If you ſay, that no Points are neceſſary, but ſuch as are Fundamentall
of their owne nature, and are to be believed explicitely; then alſo you
grant, that which <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> affirmed; that the Church, or
houſe of Proteſtants, conſiſts only in the foundation, ſeing they may
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in other Points not fundamentall, and yet remaine a Church. But then
how can this agree, with your Doctrine, that every errour againſt any
revealed Truth, is of itſelf damnable? Can it be a houſe of God, which
oppoſes Gods Teſtimony, and is not capable of ſalvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance of its damnable errours? Haue we not often cited Dr. Potter teaching
(Pag: 212.) that <hi>whatſoever is revealed in Scripture is in ſome
ſenſe Fundamentall, that is ſuch as may not be denied without
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity</hi> And (Pag: 250.) he ſaies plainly: <hi>It is Fundamentall to
a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Faith, and neceſſary for his ſalvation, that he belieue
all revealed Truths of God, wherof he may be convinced that they are from
God.</hi> Do not theſe words declare, that though Proteſtants were
ſuppoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue all Points fundamentall of their owne nature, yet they
are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of infidelity (according to Dr. Potter,) and want ſomething
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to a Chriſtians Faith, and neceſſary for ſalvation, as
long as they differ in any point ſufficiently propounded, as revealed by God?
Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, what will you reſolue? If errours in points not fundamentall, may
ſtand with the ſubſtance of the ſame Faith, Church, and hope of
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in thoſe who agree in Fundamentall Articles, then you muſt
yeald to <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſaying, that the Church of proteſtants
is a Houſe builded by the foundation only, and yet you pretend to take in 
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:59214:427"/>ill parte this ſaying of his. If you affirme, that for
conſtituting the Church, or houſe of God, there is alſo required
agreement in points not Fundamentall, you overthrow the maine tenet of
Proteſtants, that they are Brethren, and haue the ſame ſubſtance of
Faith, though they differ in ſuch vn-fundamentall points; and if you turne
about to agree with them, that men may be of the ſame Church, and hope for
ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the only belief of fundamentall points, though they differ in
non-fundamentalls, you contradict yourſelf, and Dr. Potter, who ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it
is infidelity, and damnable, and a Fundamentall error to disbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve any point,
ſufficiently propounded as revealed by God. So that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the whole matter,
you perforce ſtand for <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> whom you impugne, and
overthrow Potter, Yourſelf, and Proteſtants, whom you vndertake to defend.
To all this I add; that <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> might haue ſaied, not
only that as the foundation of a Houſe is not a Houſe, ſo the belief of
only fundamentall points, cannot make a Church, but alſo that ſeing it is
fundamentall to a Chriſtians Faith, not to deny any point revealed by God (as
we haue ſeene in Potters aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) it followes, that they who
diſagree in ſuch points want the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith, and of a Church, and
ſo cannot pretend to ſo much, in order to a Church, as a foundation is, in
reſpect of a Houſe. You ſay that <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> (Pag: 131.) takes
notice, that Dr. Potter, <hi>by Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Articles meanes all thoſe which
are neceſſary.</hi> But, by your leaue, in this you falſify both the
Doctor, and <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> who cited the words of Potter as you acknowledg he
doth, that <hi>by fundamentall doctrines we vnderſtand ſuch as are
neceſſary in ordinary courſe to be diſtinctly believed by every
Chriſtian that will be ſaved.</hi> In which words you ſee, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
ſaieth not that all neceſſary Articles are fundamentall, but only that
all fundamentall Articles are neceſſary to be believed diſtinctly, and
explicitely; and ſo he ſpeaks (Pag: 213.) <hi>Fundamentall properly is that
which Chriſtians are obliged to belieue by an express and actuall Faith.</hi>
Now I hope, Proteſtants will not deny, that it is neceſſary to belieue
every Text of Scripture, and yet will not affirme that every Text of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is a Fundamentall point, to be believed by an express and actuall Faith;
Therefore neceſſary, and Fundamentall according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the
Doctor, doe not ſignify the ſame thing, nor are of the ſame extent.</p>
               <p n="44">44. In your (N. 53.54.55.56.57.58.59.60.61.62.63.) you
ſhew ſo much choler, bitterness, and ill language, that the beſt anſwer
will <pb n="823" facs="tcp:59214:427"/>be to apply my ſelfe only to the matter,
deſiring the Reader, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the points, which I ſhall ſet downe,
and he will finde your objections anſwered, by only applying my
conſiderations to them, as they come in order.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Firſt. Before you can refer any conſidering man,
as you ſpeake, to the Scripture for his ſatisfaction, you muſt aſſure
him, that it is the word of God, which you confeſſe we can only learne from
the Church, and then if he be indeed a conſidering man, it will inſtantly
inferr, that the Church muſt be infallible, or elſe that he cannot be
infallibly true that Scripture is the word of God, nor of any one truth
contained ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and as you ſay, he may know that the Church holds ſuch
bookes to be canonicall, ſo by the like Tradition he may know, what ſhe
holds in points of Doctrine, and either belieue her in them, or not belieue her
in delivering the canon of Scripture. Beſides of whom ſhall he learne the
ſenſe of Scripture, or who will oblige him even to reade Scripture? Seing
in the principles of Proteſtants, he cannot learne any ſuch precept, except
from Scripture itſelfe; and he cannot be obliged to finde that precept in
Scripture, vnless aforehand he knowes indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of Scripture, that there
is ſuch a precept, which as I ſayd, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the principles of
Proteſtants. Moreover, yourſelf teach, that the Scripture is a
neceſſary introduction to Faith, and therfor a man muſt firſt learne
the Church, and of the Church, before you can in wiſdome refer him to the
Scripture. Which is alſo conforme to Dr. Potters aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, if he will
not contradict himſelfe. For (Pag: 139.) he teaches that the <hi>Church works
powerfully and probably as the higheſt humane Teſtimony</hi> (and you ſay
Faith is but probable in the higheſt degree, and conſequently, the Church
Works powerfully enough to ſettle an Act of your kinde of Faith) <hi>vpon
Nouices</hi> (and we ſpeake of ſuch) <hi>weakelings, and doubters in the
Faith; to inſtruct and confirme them till they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themſelves
with, and vnderſtand the Scripture.</hi> Therfore men muſt firſt be
referred to the Church, and not to the Scripture, as Potter in the ſame place
ſaieth expreſſly: <hi>The Teſtimony of the preſent Church, though it
be not the laſt reſolution of our Faith, yet it is the firſt externall
motiue to it.</hi>

though it be moſt true, that it doth not only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low out of his doctrine (as

of Potter (Pag: 167.) <hi>Generall Councells may weakely, or wilfully
miſapply, or miſvnderſtand, or neglect Scripture, and ſo erre.</hi> Now
what difference is there to ſay, a generall Councell may erre by wilfully
miſapplying, or miſvnderſtanding, or neglecting, Scripture, and a
Councell may erre damnably? Is it not damnable, wilfully to miſapply or
miſvnderſtand, or neglect Scripture? Nay wilfully expreſſes more then
damnably; becauſe one may erre damnably, if his errour be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable by
reaſon of ſome weakeness, (which D. Potter diſtinguiſheth from
wilfullnes) or for ſloath, humane reſpects, of hope, feare &amp;c. and yet
not be ſo culpable, as when it proceeds from wilfulness: and therfor
<hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> might haue ſayd, that in the doctrine of Potter,
Generall Councells may erre more than damnably. Haue we not heard the Doctours
words (Pag. 212.) <hi>whatſoever is Revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſuch as can
not be denied or Contradicted without infidelity?</hi> And ſhall not a
wilfull miſapplying, or neglect of Gods Word be damnable, and more then
ſimply damnable, even infidelity? The Doctour teaches, that the vniverſall
Church cannot erre fundamentally, but he neither doth, nor can ſay (according
to the doctrine of Proteſtants) that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells cannot erre fundamentally,
and if Fundamentally, ſurely dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably. But why doe I ſpend tyme in this?
Yourſelfe here (N. 53.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that to ſay <hi>Prelats of Gods
Church meeting in a Lawfull Councell may erre damnably,</hi> is not falſe for
the matter, but only it is falſe, that Dr. Potters ſayes it (A great wrong
to ſay the Doctour ſpeakes a truth, which he himſelfe teaches!) and ſo
finally <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> ſayd not ſo much as he might haue
ſayd of Potters aſſertion, and therfor was far enough from doing him any
wrong.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Thirdly. Seing that one muſt not, at firſt, be
referred to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as we haue proved, nor to Generall Councells, which Dr.
Potter ſays may erre weakely, and ſo be deceaved, and wilfully, and ſo
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, <pb n="825" facs="tcp:59214:428"/>nor that he can conſult with the whole Church
collectiuè or all togeather, as you grant the Doctour ſayes; what
remaines, but that he muſt deale a parte with every particular member of the
Church? Which being alſo impoſſible, as is clear of it ſelfe (and when
you ſeeke to proue it, you labour for your Adverſary, who ſayeth the very
ſame thing) it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, that all the wayes which Potter can propoſe, to a
man, deſirous to ſaue his ſoule, are not only ineffectuall, but
impoſſible alſo, and only chalke out a way to deſperation, and that He,
and other Proteſtants, muſt haue patience to be told this truth, that they
muſt not wonder, if contradictories be deduced from their Aſſertions,
which they muſt often vary, even againſt their wills. <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi>
never intended to make, or not make, a difference betweene the vniverſall
Church, and the whole Church militant, but only (Pag. 137.) cites the Doctours
words, as he findes them, and proves, that they cannot ſerue, for the effect,
of quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an afflicted ſoule, not regarding whether thoſe different
words, which he vſeth, ſignifie any different thing, or noe.</p>
               <p n="49">49. Fourthly; Seing in purſuit of ſome good and
infallible ground, wheron to ſettle Divine Faith, Potter can admit none but
the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the vniverſall Church, and that Scripture cannot
inſtruct vs with certainty, independently of the Church, as we haue
demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; nor that the whole Church can be conſulted; it remaines
only, that he muſt wiſh one to finde out ſome, who believes all
fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall points, and follow him, and that then the firſt queſtion to
paſſe betweene them ſhould be, to know whether he knows all ſuch
points, and if this cannot be knowne, it is cleare the Doctour can giue no
ſatisfaction, to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering man, deſirous to know the truth. It is
pretty that you tell vs, the Doctour in all his Booke, gives no ſuch Anſwer
as this, <hi>procure to know whether he belieue all fundamentall points of
Faith;</hi> as if <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> had preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to relate a hiſtory, and
not only to tell the Reader, what Potter, muſt be forced to anſwer,
according to his grounds; Though, I grant, he will by doing ſo, be
neceſſitated to contradict both Truth, and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: And you will never
be able to ſhew, but that Potter muſt make ſuch anſwers, as <hi>Ch:
ma:</hi> expreſt, if the Doctor will be faithfull to his owne grounds. Your
diſcourſe about probabilities, and even wagers, is impertinent; both
becauſe we deny, that indeed Dr. Potters opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Creed, hath any
probability at all, and becauſe <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes only of
probabilities, and even wagers, which is a good compariſon, ſeing a thing
very probable, doth not hinder but that the contradictory <pb n="826" facs="tcp:59214:429"/>may be very probable, and ſo be eaven or equall one to an other;
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d your talking of probability in the higheſt degree, is your owne addition,
or fiction, and not the Doctors Aſſertion, as may be ſeene in his (Pag.
241.) and yourſelf expreſly confess, (N. 4. and 5. Pag. 194.) that he
affirmed it only, to be very probable, that the Creed containes all
neceſſary points, of thoſe, which you call Credenda. What you write ſo
often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the vncertainty that one is a Pope, hath been anſwered at
large.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Fiftly. Who can deny, but that whoſoever deſires
to be ſaved, and knowes that to obtaine ſalvation, it is neceſſary to
belieue explicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all fundamentall points, will inſtantly judge it
neceſſary, to know what thoſe points be, as de facto, <hi>Ch.
Miſt.</hi> vrged to haue a Catalogue of them? Now, if to ſatiſfy this
demand, Dr. Potter gives vs no other anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but only ſome Definitions,
and Deſcriptions, or Explications of the name Fundamentall, without
ſpecifying, what they are in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and ſo not ſatiſfy at all the
deſire of any wiſe man, what can I helpe that? Or who can blame <hi>Ch:
Ma:</hi> for having ſayd, as much as Dr. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Booke could enable him to
ſay? Neither hath he patched vp any thing, out of the Doctours Booke, which
he (the Doctor) is not obliged to grant, according to his owne grounds, as I
haue ſayd.</p>
               <p n="51">51. Sixthly; Seing every article contained in the Creed
is not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, it would be demanded with <hi>Ch. Ma. How shall one know,
which in particular be, and which be not fundamentall?</hi> You ſay, <hi>Dr.
Potter would haue anſwered: it is a vaine queſtion: belieue all, and you
shall be ſure to belieue all that is Fundamentall.</hi> But by your leaue,
this buſineſſe cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to ſoone. For by occaſion of
your Anſwer, I muſt make ſome demands; whether every one is obliged, to
belieue, or know explicitly thoſe points of the Creed, which are not fund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mentall. To ſay, every one is
bound; were to make them properly Fundamentall. For we haue heard Potter
ſaying, <hi>Fundamentall properly is that, which Chriſtians are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to
belieue by an expreſſe and actuall Faith.</hi> If one be not obliged, to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue explicitely thoſe points of the Creed which are not fundamentall,
then I am not bound to know the Creed, that I may know them. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome
may ſay, I am obliged to know the Creed, becauſe it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes fundamentall
points, which I am bound to know expreſly, and ſo I ſhall, at leaſt per
accidens, and by conſequence, be obliged to know all points contained in the
Creed, as well not Fundamentall as Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall. This Anſwer muſt
ſuppoſe, that I am obliged vnder damnation, to know that Symbol, which we
call the Creed of the Apoſtles; and <pb n="827" facs="tcp:59214:429"/>ſeing
Proteſtants profeſſe, that all things neceſſary to Salvation, are
contained in Scripture alone, they muſt ſhew out of ſome expreſſe,
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent text of Scripture, ſuch a command, which you know is impoſſible
to be done, ſince Scripture never mentions any ſuch thing, as the
Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Creed, and therfor one cannot be obliged to know points not
Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, in vertue of a precept to know the Creed, ſeing Proteſtants
cannot belieue any command, obliging men to know the Creed &amp;c. Beſides,
All the Arguments, which proue that the Creed was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the
Apoſtles, or that it containes all fundamentall points, muſt be grounded
vpon the Authority of the Church, which according to Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and other
Proteſtants, may erre in points not fundamentall, and none of them affirmes,
that it is a fundamentall point, which all vnder damnation, are bound
explicitely to belieue, that the Apoſtles compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Creed, or that it
containes all fundamentall points; and then, men, cannot be ſure, that all
points contained in it, are true; and much leſſe can they be obliged, to
belieue explicitly, by an act of Faith, every Article therof, according to the
grounds of Proteſtants. Moreover, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one were perſwaded, that all
the Articles contained in the Creed were true, yet the arguments which Potter
brings, from the ſayings of ancient Fathers, and moderne Divines, can only,
in the opinion of him, and all other Proteſtants, be probable, and ſo
cannot oblige every one to know the Creed, but men may keepe their liberty.
Melior eſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio poſſidentis. And Potter himſelfe confeſſes it
to be only probable, that the Creed containes all fundamentall points, and ſo
he cannot oblige men to know the Creed, becauſe it only probably containes
all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Articles. If then you cannot proue, that any is obliged to
know the Creed, in vaine doe you ſay, <hi>belieue all, and you ſhall be
ſure to belieue all that is Fundamentall:</hi> but you muſt ſay the
direct contrary; Men are not in the Principles of Proteſtants obliged to
belieue the Creed; Therefore they are not obliged to belieue, by it, any point,
Fundamentall, or not Fundamentall. You ſay, Dr. Potter ſayes no where, that
all the Articles of the Creed, are fundamentall; Neither doth <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi>
ever affirme, that he ſayes ſo; but the thing being of it ſelf true, (and
you expreſſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it to be true) He had reaſon, joyning it with
other principles of the Doctor, to frame ſuch a Dialague as he did, betwene
Potter, and ſome deſirous to find the Truth. And now, I hope it appeares,
that you had no reaſon to accuſe <hi>Ch, Ma.</hi> of <hi>vn-ingenious
dealing,</hi> ſit for <hi>a Faire, or Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; of ſirang immodesty; of
adding to the Doctors words; of injustice; of blind <pb n="828" facs="tcp:59214:430"/>zeale, tranſporting him beyond all bounds of honesty and
diſcretion, and making him careless of ſpeaking either truth or ſenſe:
That he is a prevaricating Proxy: That he patches together a most ridiculous
anſwer; That it appeares to his ſhame &amp;c:</hi> and finally you ſay;
<hi>certainly if Dr. Potter doth Anſwer thus, I will make bold to ſay, he
is a very foole. But if he does not, then: But. I for beare you.</hi> Theſe
be your modeſt epethitons. You ſay, that we Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, interpret thoſe
divine preſcriptions (Matth: 5.) to be no more than Counſells. But I pray,
what Catholique ever taught, that our Saviour delivered only a Counſell, when
he ſaied; whoſoever ſhall ſay to his brother, thou foole, ſhall be
guilty of hell fire? But all the reſt of your acerbity, is nothing to that
fearefull denunciation which you vtter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> that our
<hi>errours</hi> (as you call them) <hi>you feare, will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
destructiue to ſuch as he is, that is, to all thoſe, who haue eyes to ſee
and will not ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="52">52. In your (N. 64.) you cavill, that <hi>Ch. Ma.
promiſes to anſwer D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Arguments against that which he (Ch. Ma.)
ſaid before. But preſently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting himſelf, in stead of anſwering
the Doctors Arguments, falls a confuting his Anſwers to the Argument of Ch.
Ma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="53">53. Anſwer, <hi>Ch. ma.</hi> (N. 20.) promiſes to
anſwer, not the Arguments, as you ſay, but the Objections of Dr. Potter,
againſt that which we had ſaid before, which be doth performe (N.
21.22.27.) and N. 23. he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to anſwer the Doctors poſitive Arguments
alledged to proue, that the Creed containes all fundamentall Articles of Faith.
And the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Doctors objections are ſo ſtrong, that you
abandon your Client, and tell vs, that he <hi>rather glances at then builds
vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; that they were ſaid ex abundanti, and therefore that you conceiue
it ſuperfluous to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the exceptions of</hi> Ch. Ma. <hi>against
them.</hi> This is an excellent anſwer, if it could be as ſatisfactory, as
it is eaſy. I muſt intreate the Reader to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe the (N. 21.22.27. of
Ch. Ma.) and he will finde, that Dr. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter needed a Defence, which will be
ſuſpected you did not giue, becauſe indeed you could not: and therefore
you fly to an other Anſwer, which you will not find in Dr. Potter; That
Scripture is not a point neceſſary to be explicitely believed. And How
ought Proteſtants to accept this anſwer; who teach that wee can belieue
nothing belonging to Chriſtian Faith, but by Scripture alone, which if they
belieue not Actually, nor are bound to belieue it, how can they Actually
believe, or be obliged to belieue the contents thereof? If the Church in your
opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon, be not infallible, and that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not obliged to belieue the
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the word of God, and infallible (which to them, who belieue 
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:59214:430"/>is not it all one, as if it were not) what certainty can
Proteſtants haue, either that the Creed containes all fundamentall Articles
of ſimple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, or that thoſe which it containes, are true? you ſay 
<q rend="margQuotes">Gregory of Ualentia, ſeemes to
confess, the Creeds being collected out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuppoſing the
Authority of it.</q> But Ualentia (2.2. Diſp. 1. Queſt. 1. Punct. 4.)
ſaied only, that the Creed containes thoſe things, which are in different
places contayned in Scripture, which is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true; but he ſaieth not;
the Creed was collected out of Scripture, which was written after the Creed was
compoſed; one thinghe ſaieth, which had bene more for your purpoſe to
obſerue, that in believing the Creed, we are to regard the ſence. 
<q rend="margQuotes">Non enim (ſaieth he) ſufficit
haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in cortice verborum.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="54">54. Subtract from your (N. 65.) what hath bene anſwered
already, or may be anſwered by a meere denyall, or which implies a begging of
the Queſtion, there will remaine only your ſaying (which yet I cannot ſay
deſerves any anſwer) that Ch. Ma. <hi>ſpeakes that which is hardly
ſenſe, in calling the Creed an abridgment of ſome Articles of Faith. For
I demand</hi> (ſay you) <hi>theſe ſome Articles which you ſpeak of,
which are they? Thoſe that are out of the Creed, or thoſe that are in it?
Thoſe that are in it, it comprehends at large, and therfore it is not an
abridgment of them: Thoſe that are out of it, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends not at all, and
therfore is not an abridgment of them. If you would call it now an abridgment
of the Faith, this would be ſenſe, and ſignifie thus much, That all the
neceſſary Articles of Chriſtian Faith are comprized in it. For it is the
proper duty of abridgments, to leaue out nothing neceſſary, and to take in
nothing vnneceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="55">55. Anſwer; this your ſubtility is ſo farr from
being of any ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it overthrowes all abridgments, contradicts Dr.
Potter, and your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and proves, that the Creed performes not the proper
dury of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridgment, as you ſay it is; and therfor you are injurious to,
it and the compoſers therof. Firſt your objection may be made againſt
every Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redgment, by demanding, <hi>whether it be an abridgment of thoſe
points that are out of it, or of thoſe that are in it? Thoſe that are in
it, it comprehends at large, and therfor it is not an abridgment of them:
Thoſe that are out of it, it comprehends not at all, and therfor it is not an
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridgment of them.</hi> Secondly; you contradict Dr. Potter, who ſaieth,
(Pag: 234.) <hi>The Creed is an abſtract or Abridgment of ſuch
neceſſary Doctrines as are delivered in Seripture, or collected ous of
it:</hi> And Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Maintay. ſaieth, it is an abridgment of ſome
articles, and ſo the words <pb n="830" facs="tcp:59214:431"/>of the Doctor are more
reſtrained and limited, than thoſe of Ch. Ma. who ſpecifyed not
neceſſary Doctrines, but vſed the ſigne, ſome, which abſtracts from
neceſſary or not neceſſary, and in that ſence is more illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, and
may be better divided into diverſe members or parts, and ſo more capable of
being compendiated, than if it were more ſimple and individed, and as it were
of it ſelf a compendium, before it could be compendiated. Now I pray you tell
the Doctor of Divinity, that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes that which is hardly ſenſe: and
demand of him; theſe neceſſary Doctrines, of which you ſay the Creed is
an <hi>abridgment, which are they? Thoſe that are out of the Creed, or
thoſe that are in it? Thoſe that are in it, it comprehends at large and
therefore, it is not an abridgment of them. Thoſe that are out of it, it
comprehends not at all, and therfore it is not an abridgment of them.</hi>
Thirdly: yourſelf in the beginning of this Chapter (N. 1. and 5.) ſay, that
the Doctors Aſſertion is, that the Creed is a Summary of all thoſe
Doctrines (or Credenda) which all men are bound particularly to belieue, and
this you endeavour to make good, through the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now, you muſt
ask yourſelf; whether the Creed be a Summary of theſe Doctrines, or
Credenda, which are in it, or which are out of it &amp;c. and ſo apply your
Argument againſt yourſelf, and the Doctor. In this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place you ſay,
if it be called an abridgment of the Faith, this would be ſenſe. But if
this would be ſenſe, I am ſure your objection can haue none. For then
againe aske of yourſelfe, whether it be an abridgment, of ſuch points of
the Faith, as are in it, or as are out of it; and you will find that every
ſyllable of your owne objection, muſt be anſwered by yourſelfe.
Beſides, is it an abridgment of all, or of ſome part of the Faith? You will
not ſay it is an abridgment of all the Faith, ſeing you confeſſe, that
much of the Faith is not in the Creed, namely thoſe points which you call
agenda, and you tell vs, it cannot be an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch articles as it
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehends not. If then it be not an abridgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all articles of Faith, and
yet is an abridgment of Faith, as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe; it muſt be an abridgment
of ſome Articles of Faith, which are the very words and propoſition of
<hi>Ch. ma.</hi> which you impugne and ſay, it is hardly ſenſe. Fourthly.
Having told vs that <hi>all the neceſſary Articles of the Chriſtian Faith
are comprized in the Creed,</hi> you add; <hi>for this is the proper duty of
abridgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to leaue out nothing neceſſary, and to take in nothing
vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi> Now, you gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that there are in the Creed, ſome
articles not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or Fundamentall, therfor the Creed or the
compoſers therof, faild in the proper duty of abridgments, or if you deny
this conſequence you <pb n="831" facs="tcp:59214:431"/>muſt deny your owne words, that
the <hi>proper duty of abridgments is to take in nothing vnneceſſary;</hi>
or finally deny, that which you expreſly grant, that in the Creed there are
ſome points vnfundamentall, and ſo heape con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction vpon contradiction.
On the other ſide, Agenda are neceſſary, and yet are not contayned in the
Creed, and ſo neither part of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per duty of abridgments is true. The
truth is you abuſe the word neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, not diſtinguiſhing betweene
neceſſary to be believed, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be ſet downe in the
Creed, For neither is it neceſſary, that all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary points of
beliefe be expreſt in the Creed (as you confeſſe Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da are not) nor is
it neceſſary, that no point vnfundamentall, or vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, be ſet
downe therin: only it was neceſſary for the Apoſtles, to ſet downe all
that, which the Holy Ghoſt moved them to expreſſe, with which it is
alſo neceſſary for vs to be content: notwithſtanding your to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall
humane reaſons to the contrary. But what anſwer ſhall we giue to your
objection? Truly it is ſo eaſy a taske, that I ſcarſely judge it
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to giue any at all. For what is more eaſy, then to ſay? The
Creed is an abridgment of ſome Articles, not becauſe it doth not containe
them, but becauſe it containes them not at large, with explanations, proofes,
illuſtrations, deductions, ſequels, concluſions, and the like. For if one
ſet downe at large, all that he pretends to abridg, he is not an
Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviator, but an Amanuenſis, or Copiſt. And in this I may alledge your
ſelfe, who in this very Chapter (N. 31.) ſay; <hi>Summaries muſt not omit
any neceſſary Doctrine of that Science wherof they are Summaries, though
the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrations and Reaſons of it they may omit.</hi> Thus then the
Creed may be an abridgment of ſome Articles, both fundamentall, and not
fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, without any ſuch non-ſenſe, as you are pleaſed to
object. But ſurely it will ſeeme ſomewhat ſtrange to ſay, as you doe,
<hi>Thoſe Articles that are in the Creed it comprehends at large, and therfor
it is not an abridgment of them:</hi> as if nothing can be ſet downe in the
Creed, or any other writing, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and particularly, but it muſt be ſet
downe at large; which is to take away all briefe and compendious treatiſes;
and therefore, as I ſayd, your ſelfe muſt anſwer your owne objection.
Out of what we haue ſaied, is anſwered your (N. 66.) wherein you, and the
Doctor, muſt either ſuppoſe, and begg the queſtion, in ſuppoſing
that all points of ſimple belief are contayned in the Creed, or els his
Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is of no force at all.</p>
               <p n="56">56. To your (N. 67.68.) the Anſwer is very eaſy, that
all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogations of Potter, which you call <hi>plaine and convincing
Arguments,</hi> are nothing but plaine beggings of the queſtion, and
ſuppoſe that the <pb n="832" facs="tcp:59214:432"/>whole way to heauen; all Articles of
Faith; the whole Counſell of God; all neceſſary matters; are contained in
the Creed; which you know is the thing controverted. The Doctour ſhould
firſt haue proved, that the Creed containes all neceſſary points, and
then haue vrged thoſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogations: <hi>May the Churches of after ages
make the narrow way to heaven narrower then our Saviour left it &amp;c.</hi>
Doe not you, and the Doctour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that men cannot come to heaven by
believing only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Creed, but muſt alſo belieue Agenda?
and beſides the Faith of both theſe kindes of Articles, they muſt keepe
the commandements, and ſo the Doctour, muſt anſwer his owne
interrogations: and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was guilty of what I haue ſayd; I meane,
that all his interrogations could be to no purpoſe, vnless firſt it be
proved, that the Creed contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes all neceſſary points. For this cauſe
(Pag. 222.) after he had, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionatory way, made his interrogations, he
ſayth: <hi>All that can be replyed to this diſcourſe is this, that the
whole Faith of thoſe times is not contained in the Apoſtles Creed, as if a
man ſhould ſay, this is not the Apoſtles Creed, but a part of it.</hi>
Now Char. Maint. (Pag. 143. N. 25.) and in the following num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, having
anſwered this, and other objections, and ſome of them in his ſecond part
(Chap. 7.) through divers numbers, it remaines that all his interrogations were
fully anſwered; the very foundation, vpon which they ſtood (that the Creed
containes all neceſſary points) being demoliſhed, and in particular his

matters on the Faith of Chriſtians?</hi> Seing yourſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that
he profeſſes the Creed to containe all neceſſary points of Faith, not
abſolutely, but <hi>as it was further opened and explained in ſome parts
(by occaſion of emergent Hereſies) in the other Catholick Creeds of Nice,
Conſtantinople, Epheſius, Chalcedon, and Athanaſius,</hi> which are his
owne words (Pag: 216.) and therfor he muſt anſwer his owne demand, <hi>What
tyranny is it to impoſe any new vnneceſſary matters &amp;c.</hi> Since
the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Councells, were long after the Apoſtles time: and
for this cauſe, you expreſly profeſſe, to forſake the Doctour, in
this his expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Creed, as we haue ſeene hertofore.</p>
               <p n="57">57. To your (N. 69.70.71.72.73.) I anſwer; <hi>Ch.
Ma.</hi> had reaſon to ſay, that Potter citing the words of S. Paul (Act.
20. V. 27.) adds this gloſſe of his owne (needfull for our ſalvation.)
For the Apoſtle both in our tranſlation, and in the Proteſtant Engliſh
Bible, hath, profitable, not, needfull, and yourſelfe here (N. 69.) grant the
ſame. And ſpeaking in rigor, that which is ſtrictly profitable, is not
needfull, or neceſſary, nor <pb n="833" facs="tcp:59214:432"/>that which is properly
needfull, is profitable, as profitable and needfull, are membra
contradiſtincta, as when we diſtinguiſh Meanes to ſome End, that ſome
are profitable, others neceſſary; and you know it is in Logick no good
diviſion, wherin one of the membra dividentia inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the other; and
therfor, your ſaying to <hi>Ch: Ma: I hope you will make no difficulty to
grant that whatſoeuer is needfull for ſalvation is very profitable,</hi> is
ſpoken with greater confidence, then truth. But for our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
ſeing the Apoſtle (Uerſ. 20.) ſayth, 
<q rend="margQuotes">I haue withdrawen nothing that was
profitable,</q> and ſayth not, I haue withdrawen nothing that was needfull,
it followes, that the Apoſtle taught, not only neceſſary, but alſo
profitable things; and thence I inferr, that when he ſayth (V. 27.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">I haue not ſpared to declare vnto you
all the counſel of God,</q> he meant not only of neceſſary, but alſo of
profitable points, and therfore of more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are contained in the Creed. For
which cauſe he (C Ma.) had reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take notice of this place in
particular, which clearly ſhewes, out of the very text of Scripture, which
Potter cites, his interrogations to be of no force, but only to begg the
queſtion, by ſuppoſing vntruly, that whatſoever the Apoſtles revealed
to the Church, is contained in the Creed. To ſalue this you ſay (N. 70.)
<hi>It is not D. Potter that beggs the Queſtion, but you that miſtake it,
which is not here in this particular place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all points of ſimple
Beliefe neceſſary for the ſalvation of the primitiue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were
contained in the Apoſtles Symbol? (for that and the proofes of it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after in the next</hi> (§ Pag. 223. <hi>of Dr. Potter:</hi>) <hi>but
whether any thing can be neceſſary for Chriſtians to belieue now which
was not ſo from the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="58">58. Anſwer. Dr. Potter (Pag: 216.217.) ſayeth:
<hi>The Creed of the Apoſtles is ſayd generally by the Schoolemen and
Fathers, to comprehend a perfect Catalogue of Fundamentall truths; and to imply
a full rejection of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall hereſies: and hath been receaved by
Orthodox Chriſtians, as an abſolute ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie of the Chriſtian Faith.
For proofe wherof, we will firſt argue ad hominem and teach the Miſtaker
how to eſteeme of his Creed, out of his owne Maſters.</hi> And then having
alledged divers Catholik Writers, to proue his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he adds; <hi>it
were eaſy to multiply teſtimonies to this effect, out of their late and
ancient ſchoole Doctors if it were not tedious. All agree that the Creed
brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely comprehends all Fundamentall principles or rudiments of Faith; that
it is a diſtinctiue Character ſevering Orthodox believers from inſidels
and heretiks, that it is a full, perfect, and ſufficient ſummary of the
Catholik Faith.</hi> Thus he. And immediatly after ſayth: <hi>Their
judgment</hi> (that is the judgment of Catholik Authors whom he alledged)
<hi>herein</hi> that is for the purpos of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <pb n="834" facs="tcp:59214:433"/>the
Creed to containe all Fundamentall Articles, <hi>ſeemes full of
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> And his reaſons he ſetts downe in theſe words immediatly
following: <hi>For how can it be neceſsary for any Chriſtian to haue more
in his Creed, then the Apoſtles had, and the Church of their times? May the
Church of after ages make the narrow way to heaven, narrower then our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
left it?</hi> And ſo he goes on with his interrogations, and in the ſame
context hath theſe words of which we ſpeake; <hi>The Apoſtles
profeſſe they revealed to the Church the whole counſell of God keeping
back nothing needfull for our Salvation: What Tyranny then is it to impoſe
any new neceſsary matters on the Faith of Chriſtians?</hi> I pray you
conſider, whether he doth not ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke expreſſly of the Apoſtles
Creed, when he ſaith, <hi>How can it be neceſsary for any Chrictian to haue
more in this Creed then the Apoſtles had, and the Church of their time?</hi>
And doe not you (N. 15.) expressly vnderſtand theſe words of the Doctor of
the Apoſtles Creed, as it is <hi>a full comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that part of the
beliefe of the Apoſtles which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines only the neceſsary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of
ſimple Faith?</hi> And conſequently when the Doctour askes, <hi>How can it
be neceſſary for any Chriſtian to haue more in his Creed then the
Apoſtles had,</hi> his demand muſt be; How can it be neceſſary for any
Chriſtian, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue more then the Creed containes? Which evidently
ſuppoſes, that the Creed containes all things neceſſary; otherwiſe it
might be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to belieue ſome thing, not contained in the Creed.
Beſides, what connexion can ther be in the Doctours words, taken in your
ſenſe, which will make him argue in this manner? No Chriſtian is obliged
to belieue more then the Apoſtles believed, who certainly believed more then
is contained in the Creed, Therfor <hi>the judgment of thoſe who teach that
the Creed containes all Fundamentall points is full of reaſon.</hi> And
indeed the Doctor had no occaſion at all, to proue, that it can not be
neceſſary, for any Chriſtian, to belieue more then the Apoſtles did
belieue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> ſay any ſuch thing. And why doe you
(N. 67.) exact of <hi>C Ma:</hi> an a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer to D. Potters interrogations, if
they proue only, that no Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is obliged to belieue more then the
Apoſtles believed, which as I ſayd <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> never denied. Will you
haue him <hi>(C: Ma:)</hi> confute his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne judgment, and anſwer thoſe
arguments, which were intended only to proue his owne beliefe? Thus while you
will be clearing the Doctour, from begging the queſtion, you make him with
great paines, and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe of words, make many patheticall interrogations nothing
to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and grant that which is the only maine point, that thoſe
his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations, proue not, that all fundamentall points be contained in
the <pb n="835" facs="tcp:59214:433"/>Creed. Chuſe of theſe inconveniences which you
pleaſe. Truly I cannot imagine, that any man would haue dreamed, that Dr.
Potter did not intend, by thoſe interrogations, to proue that the Creed
containes all fundamentall points; whether we conſider the only queſtion in
hand, or the clear connexion, and thread of his words, as I haue ſhewed, and
that all his interrogations tended to make good, that no Chriſtian can be
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to belieue more, as neceſſary, then the Apoſtles believed to be
neceſſary; of which neceſſary points you ſay (N, 65.) the Creed is a
full comprehenſion, and conſequently, that he intended to proue ſo much
by his interrogations, though, I grant, he faild in his proofes and
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his intention; which he perceiving, did afterward ſeeke to
corroborate them with other reaſons; which conſideration, beſide what
hath been ſayd, doth evidently declare, that in his interrogations he
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to perſwade vs, that the Creed containes all neceſſary points
of Faith. For let vs ſuppoſe with you, that his purpos was only to proue,
that no Chriſtian is bound to belieue more then the Apoſtles believed, and
not, that no Chriſtian is bound to belieue more then the

                  </gap>, with what connexion, or
ſenſe, could Potter ſay immediatly after thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogations? <hi>All
that can be replyed to this diſcourſe is, that the whole Faith of thoſe
times is not contained in the Apostles Creed; which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> they not plainely tell vs that the Summe and
Substance of their Credenda is comprized in it?</hi> If Potter in his
interrogations, meant only to proue, that no Chriſtian is bound to belieue
more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles believed, how did he imagine, that it could be
replyed, againſt that diſcourſe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thoſe interrogations of his, that
the <hi>whole Faith of thoſe times is not contained in the Apostles
Creed,</hi> if, I ſay, his diſcourſe according to your interpretation,
aymed at no ſuch matter? Or to what purpos doth the Doctour as ſoone as he
had ſayd, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be replye to his diſcourſed, except that
the whole Faith of thoſe times, is not contained in the Apoſtles Creed,
inſtantly ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to proue, that the Creed containes the Summe, and
ſubſtance of the Credenda of the Apoſtles, and Church of their times? As
if by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this, that reply were confuted, and his Interrogations made
good; which yet had been good (if they were vnderſtood of the whole extent of
the Apoſtles beliefe) though it were ſuppoſed, that the Creed contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
not all fundamentall points of Faith. For whether it contained them or no, it
is moſt true, that no Chriſtian is obliged, to belieue more then 
<pb n="836" facs="tcp:59214:434"/>the Apoſtles believed of things, contained, and not
contained, in the Creed. Looke now whether I may not retort the words which you
direct againſt <hi>Charity Maintayn? Conſider I pray a litle better, and
then I hope you will acknowledge, that there was no Petitio principij in Dr.
Potter, but rather Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio Elencht, in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="59">59. You doe but looſe time, in proving, that S. Paul
(Act: 20.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">ſpoke to the Paſtours, yet that he
ſpoke of what he taught not only them, but alſo the Laity as well as
them.</q> And you wonder <hi>Charity Maintayned ſhould read the Text ſo
negligently, as not to obſerue it. Ch. Ma.</hi> never ſayd, that the
Apoſtle ſpoke to the Paſtors only, or that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them only,
but that the ſayd words were directed particularly to the Paſtors or
Governours of the Church, and yourſelfe grant the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did all theſe
things (of which he ſpeakes) <hi>to the Paſtours among the reſt, nay
aboue the reſt:</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfor <hi>C: Ma:</hi> did clearly deduce, that the
Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour could not collect from thoſe words, that the Apoſtle ſpoke of
things neceſſary, for all ſortes of perſons, to belieue; ſeing (Pag;
244.) He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, that more knowledge is neceſſary in Biſhops, and
Prieſts, to whome is committed the government of the Church, then in vulgar
Laicks, as <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> obſerves; and conſequently, he could
not gather out of thoſe words, what points be neceſſary for all, and much
leſſe that all neceſſary points are contained in the Creed. In a word,
the Apoſtle ſpoke of more then all are obliged to belieue, and more then is
contained in the Creed, and therfor, Potter could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve by thoſe words,
that if it were neceſſary for every one, to belieue more than is contained
in the Creed, every one muſt belieue more, or as much, as the Paſtors are
obliged to belieue.</p>
               <p n="60">60. No wonder if thoſe Reaſons of Dr. Potter, which
you mention (N 74.) were not particularly anſwered, being ſo clearly
falſe, as they are anſwered by a meere denyall. For that the <hi>Ancient
Church appointed her infants to be inſtructed for matters of ſimple beliefe
only in the Creed, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her Catechumens vnto baptiſme and
ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers to her communion, vpon their only profeſsion of the Creed,</hi>
is evidently falſe. For how many notorious he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to belieue the
Creed? Which therfor alone, without other knowledge, and circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances of the
perſons, &amp;c. could not be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to admit ſtrangers into the
communion of the Church: and who knows not that Catechumens are inſtructed,
in many more points of Faith, then are expreſt in the Creed? Infants, if you
ſpeake properly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be inſtructed in the Creed, or any other part of
Chriſtian Faith? The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir Patrini ſurely know more points of Faith, then the
Creed alone. But <pb n="837" facs="tcp:59214:434"/>why did you not confute the anſwer,
which you confeſſe <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> gives to Potters Fourth Reaſon about
the letters called formatae, which containe more then the Creed, as may be
ſeene in <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned</hi> (Par: 2. P: 171.) and it will be found,
that you had reaſon to diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his diſcourſe, which proves, that
more was required to be belieued then only the Creed, as appeares even by
Potter himſelfe, ſpeaking of thoſe letters (Pag: 224.) in theſe words:
<hi>If in thoſe letters he did profeſſe entirely to adhere to the
Catholick Creeds, his profeſsion and perſon was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as ſound and
Orthodox.</hi> Wher you ſee the beliefe of more Creeds was required, then of
the Apoſtles Creed only.</p>
               <p n="61">61. Although the reſt of the numbers in this Chapter,
containe no particular difficulty, which may not be ſolved, by our former
grounds, and therfor might well be omitted, eſpecially ſeeing you, and the
Doctor, grant as much, as is more then ſufficient, for our maine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,
that in vaine Proteſtants alledge their beliefe of the Creed, to ſhew that
they agree in all Fundamentall points of Faith, and it appeares very cleare of
it ſelfe, ſeing it containes not all eſſentiall points of Chriſtian
practice, yet I will caſt an eye on your Numbers
(75.76.77.78.79.80.81.82.83.84.) as they lye in order. Divers Points, which
haue connexion, or were circumſtances of the Articles ſet downe in the
Creed, might haue been expreſt, beſides thoſe which are ſpecified in
it, and therfor <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> may ſtill aske, why ſome ſuch are
expreſt, and others are not; and you muſt finally anſwer, with <hi>Ch.
Ma.,</hi> that the Apoſtles ſet downe thoſe Points Fundamentall, and not
Fundamentall, which the Holy Ghoſt inſpired them to deliver; as you ſay,
they were inſpired to ſet downe Credenda, and not Agenda, though theſe be
of no leſſe importance, and neceſſity then thoſe, and you ſtill
begg the Queſtion (N. 75.) that the end which the Apoſtles propoſed, was
to ſet downe all neceſſary points of Faith. The reaſons which you giue
(N. 76.) why ſome myſteries were omitted, and others ſet downe, can only
be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruences of that which is done de facto, and not arguments convincing
that they could not haue done otherwiſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they did, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d if they had ſet
downe others, and not theſe, there could not haue wanted reaſons for their
ſo doing. That the three Sages who came to adore our Saviour, were alſo
Kings, is no new invention of <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> but the judgment of the Ancient;
as may be ſeene in Cornelius a Lapide (in Matth. Chap. 2.) citing by name the
Saints, Ciprian, Baſil, Chriſoſtom. Hierom, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, and Tertullian,
Iſidore, Beda, Idacius. The words which you <pb n="838" facs="tcp:59214:435"/>cited out
of Gordonius Huntlaeus (Contr: 2. Cap. 10. N. 10.) that the Apoſtles were not
ſo forgetfull, after the receiving of the holy Ghoſt, as to leaue out any
prime a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Principall Foundation of Faith, make nothing for your purpos; ſeing
we diſpute not whether any prime or principall foundation of Faith be left
out (for we acknowledge that the Creed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the Creator of all
things, and Redeemer of mankinde, as alſo the Bleſſed Trinity,
Reſurrection, Catholique Church, Remiſſion of ſinnes, and life
everlaſting, which of themſelves, are prime and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall foundations of
our Faith, if they be vnderſtood, according to the interpretation, and
tradition of the Church) but whether any neceſſary, (though not prime, and
principall) be left out; and that may well be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which is not
prime and principall, as many parts are neceſſary to make a houſe, which
are not the prime, and principall parts therof. Yet indeed Gordonius in that
10. Chapter, aſſignes the properties of the foundation of Faith, that is,
of that Authority vpon which our Faith relies; which he proves (Chap. 11.) not
to be Scripture alone, and (C. 12.) not to be the private ſpirit; but (Chap,
13.) to be the Church, and he ſaieth, 
<q rend="margQuotes">the Apoſtles could not leaue out of
their Creed (in quo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentur omnia prima fundamenta Fidei) this primum
&amp; praencipuum Fidei fundamentum.</q> Where you ſee he ſpeakes of the
Firſt foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faith, and more things may be neceſſary than the
Firſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Beſides, we deny not, but all neceſſary points are
contained in the Creed, in ſome of thoſe ſenſes, which I haue declared
hertofore: which being well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered (particularly that Article of the
Catholick Church) will demonſtrate, that the Creed, togeather with thoſe
means, which are affoarded vs by tradition &amp;c: for the true vnderſtanding
therof, and vndoubted ſupplying of what is not contained in it, is of no
leſſe vſe, and profit, then if all points had been expreſt, which
indeed had been to little purpos, yea would haue proved noxious, by the malice
of men, without the declaration of the Church, for the Orthodox ſenſe, and
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them.</p>
               <p n="62">62. You doe not well in ſaying, that <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> denyes this conſequence of Dr. Potter <hi>(That as well, nay
better, they might haue given no Article but that of the Church, and ſent vs
to the Church for all the rest. For in ſetting downe others beſides that,
and not all, they make vs belieue we haue all, when we haue not all) and
neither gives reaſon against it, nor ſatisfies his reaſon for it.</hi>
For <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> performes both thoſe things, neither of which
you ſay he performes, as every one may ſee, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads 
<pb n="839" facs="tcp:59214:435"/>his (N. 29.) to ſay nothing, that in good Logick the
defendent is not obliged to giue a reaſon, why he denyes a conſequence, it
being reaſon ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the opponent, or diſputant proves it not;
though yet indeed <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> doth ſhew the inſufficiency
of the Doctors inference, by giving the like conſequences, which
confeſſedly cannot be good, and yourſelfe endeavour to anſwer the
reaſons of <hi>Charity Maintayned,</hi> which he brought againſt the ſayd
inference of Potter. You ſay, <hi>If our doctrine were true this ſhort
Creed, I belieue the Roman Church to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, would haue been better,
that is, more effectuall, to keepe the believers of it from hereſie, and in
the true Faith, then this Creed which now we haue: a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſo
evident, that I cannot ſee, how either you, or any of your religion or
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any ſenſible man can from his hart deny it. Yet becauſe you make
ſhew of doing ſo, or elſe, which I rather hope, doe not rightly aprehende
the force of the Reaſon, I will endeavour briefly to add ſome light and
ſtrength to it, by comparing the effects of thoſe ſever all ſuppoſed
Creeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="63">63. Anſwer: perhaps I ſhall ſay in the beginning,
that which will make your endeavour, proue vaine. You ſay: <hi>If our
doctrine were true, this ſhort Creed, I belieue the Roman Church to be
infallible, would haue been bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is, more effectuall to keepe the
believes of it from hereſie, and in the true Faith, then this Creed which now
we haue.</hi> But this ground of yours is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe. For the effect,
or Fruit, or Goodneſſe, or Betterneſſe (ſo to ſpeake) of the Creed,
is not ſufficiently explicated, by being more effectuall to keepe men from
hereſy, and in the true Faith, but it impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es alſo, ſom particular
articles, which are to be believed, in the beliefe of which, that we may not
erre, the infallibility of the Church directs a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſecures vs, which office
ſhe might, and would, haue performed, although this Article, I belieue the
Catholick Church directs, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſecures vs, had not beene expreſt in the
Creed: yea that article, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the whole Creed, ſuppoſes the infallibility of
the Church to haue been proved, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d believed antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſo
we may be aſſured, all the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts therof, to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly true. Now by
the preciſe beliefe of that Creed, which you propoſe, taken alone, we could
not belieue any particular article of Faith; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this preciſe act,
<hi>I belieue the Church to be infallible,</hi> terminates in that one object
of the infallibility of the Church, from which I grant the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of other
particular objects may be derived, when the Church ſhall propoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ipſo facto, we ſhould begin to beleeue other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar objects, and
ſo haue an other Creed, and not that little one, of which you ſpeake, and
beſides which, we are obliged to belieue other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar 
<pb n="840" facs="tcp:59214:436"/>revealed Truths; and therfor we muſt ſtill haue
ſome other Creed, or Catechiſme, or what you would haue it called,
beſides that one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Catholick Church, as <hi>Charity
Maintayned</hi> obſerves (Pag: 144.) and conſequently, though that article
of the Church, haue that great, and neceſſary effect, of keeping vs from
hereſy, and in the true Faith; yet it wants that other property of a Creed,
of ſetting downe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Truths. Whence it followes, that that article
alone cannot be a Creed, as men ſpeake of Creeds, and particular points may
be a Creed, though that article of the Church were not expreſt, but
preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and proved independently, both of the Creed, and Scripture,
in manner declared heretofore. And here Dr. Potter ſhould remember his owne
doctrine, and the doctrine of moſt Proteſtants, that the Church cannot erre
in Fundamentall Articles of Faith, and therfor, according to your manner of
arguing, this ſhort Creed <hi>I belieue the Church to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in all
Fundamentall points, would haue been better, that is, more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to keepe
the believers of it from hereſy and in the true Faith, then this Creed which
now we know:</hi> and ſo, either you muſt forſake the Doctor, about the
Churches infallibility in fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>talls, or he muſt reject your argument and
both of you grant, that you proue nothing againſt <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> but only
contradict one another: You confeſſe, that the Creed containes not Agenda;
why doe you not ſay? It had been better to refer vs to the Church, then to
ſet downe in the Creed only Credenda, which alone are not ſufficient to
bring any man to heaven; and ſo make men thinke hey haue all in the Creede,
when the haue ſcharsly halfe. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover, If you reſpect only infallibility,
or being more effectuall to keepe men from hereſy; in your grounds, neither
the Articles of the Church, nor the other articles, as they are now in the
Creed, could haue ſo great commodity, and no danger (as you ſay, ſpeaking
of the Churches infallibility) as this one generall article, belieue the
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be infallible; and therfor, either you muſt take this one
article as the beſt Creed, (which no man will ever grant) or anſwer your
owne argument, by ſaying: To belieue the Scripture, is too generall an
object, and that a Creed, or Catechiſme, muſt include ſome other
particular objects; or ſome ſuch anſwer you muſt giue, which will be
eaſily turned vpon yourſelfe. Thus your (N. 78. and 79.) which goe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
your firſt ſuppoſition, that that Creed is the better that keepes the
believer of it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereſy &amp;c, remaine confuted and the Syllogiſme
which you make, proves a meere paralogiſme. For, that petite Creed, which 
<pb n="841" facs="tcp:59214:436"/>you propoſe, would be ſo farr from having greater
commodities (in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the intent of Creeds) then this other, that it could
be no Creed at all, in that ſenſe, in which hitherto the ancient Fathers,
and all Divines haue ſpoken of Creeds, and of ſummaries of Faith. If you
haue a minde to change the name, and meaning of Creeds, and to ſubſtitute
ſome one propoſition, indeed I know no better, in order to vſe and
ſafety, then this The viſible Church of Chriſt is infallible. For this
being once believed, I may learne what is true Scripture, what the ſenſe
therof, what points be neceſſary in all occaſions; which commodity we
cannot attaine by Scripture alone, as hath been often ſayd,</p>
               <p n="64">64. You ſay (N. 80.) <hi>That having compared the
inference of Ch. ma. and Dr. Potters togeather, you cannot diſcover any
ſhadow of reſemblance betweene them, nor any ſhew of reaſon why the
perfection of the Apoſtles Creed ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a neceſsity of ſome
Body to deliver it. Much leſſe why the whole Creeds containing all things
neceſſary, ſhould make the beliefe of a part of it vnneceſſary. As
well for ought I vnderſtand, you might avouch this inference to be as good,
as Dr. Potters: The Apoſtles Creedcontaines all things neceſſary, therfor
there is no need to belieue in God. Neither does it follow ſo well, as Dr.
Potters Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follows, That if the Apoſtles Creed containes all things
neceſſary, that all other Creeds and Catechiſmes wherin are added diuers
other particulars, are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. For theſe other particulars may be the
duties of obedience, they may be profitable points of Doctrine, they may be
good expoſitions of the Apoſtles Creed, and ſo not ſuperfluous; and yet
for all this the Creed may ſtill containe all points of beliefe that are
ſimply neceſſary. Theſe therfor are poore conſequences but no more
like Dr. Potters, then an apple is likean Oiſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="65">65. Anſwer; Dr. Potter argued, that if the Apoſtles,
did not deliver in the Creed all neceſſary points, they might as well haue
given only that Article of the Church. Which manner of arguing Ch. Ma. retorts,
and ſayth, we may rather inferr thus: 
<q rend="margQuotes">If the Apoſtles delivered in the
Creed, all neceſſary points, what need we any Church to teach vs? And
conſequently what need is there of the Atticle concerning the Church? What
need we the Creed of Nice, Conſtantinople, &amp;c. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous are your
Catheciſmes, wherin beſides the articles of the Creed, you haue divers
other particulars. Theſe would be poore conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and ſo. is
yours.</q> Thus Ch. Ma.; who, as you ſee, doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue theſe
conſequences, but expreſly ſaith, they are poore ones. Which
conſequences, while you alſo, labour to diſproue, you doe but take paines
for your adverſary, to your owne coſt. But at leaſt you will 
<pb n="842" facs="tcp:59214:437"/>ſay, <hi>ther is no ſhadow of reſemblance betweene
them, and that of Dr. Potters.</hi> Yes; ther is this reſemblance: That as
the Doctour argues: all neceſſarie points are not contained in the Creed,
therfor, it had been as good, or better, to haue no Article of the Creed, but
that of the Church, leaſt that as he ſaieth (Pag. 226.) <hi>in ſetting
downe others beſides that, and yet not all, they may make vs belieue we haue
all, when we haue not all:</hi> So, contrarily, <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> argues; That
if all other neceſſary points be contained in the Creed, what need we the
Church to teach vs, or that Article of the Church? which deduction might be
made good, by the Doctours feare, leaſt that if we haue that Article of the
Church, we may thinke that alone ſufficient, (wherein he might be confirmed
by the commodityes which you ſay are implied in the point of the Churches
infallibility) and ſo be careleſſe, in ſeeking any other particular
object, or article of Faith. Which argument is like to that of the Doctours,
except only, that indeed it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his, and may be made a kinde
of demonſtration, by adding, that, in your grounds, the article of the Church
is not fundamentall, or neceſſary to ſalvation, and therfor whoſoever
believes all the articles of the Creed (if it be ſuppoſed to containe all
neceſſary points of Faith) may be ſaved, though he belieue not that of
the Church, of which you ſay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in this your fourth Chapter (N.
34.45.) that it is not a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall article, and conſequently, not
neceſſary to ſalvation: yea, it is further infer'd from hence, that D.
Potters argument is of no force; ſeing it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better to haue one only
vnneceſſary article of Faith, then to haue divers fundamentall articles
(which no man denyes the Creed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) and want that one, not
neceſſary, or vnfundamentall point. You ſay, that you <hi>cannot
diſcover any ſhew of reaſon, why the perfection of the Apoſtles Creed
ſhould exclude a neceſsity of ſome body to deliver it.</hi> Neither can I
diſcover, how this argument is not againſt yourſelfe, who teach that the
Creed containes all neceſſary points of Faith, and that the article, which
doth concerne the Church, is none of thoſe neceſſary points: from whence
it follow, that the perfection of the Creed, that is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of all
neceſſary articles, excludes a neceſſity of believing that arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of
the Church. For it implyes contradiction, that I ſhould belieue all that is
neceſſary to be believed, and yet ſome other points ſhould be
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or that a point not neceſſary, ſhould be neceſſary.
Neither is this, in your grounds, to <hi>exclude a neceſsity of ſome body
to deliver the Creed,</hi> but only, to exclude a neceſſity of believing,
that this muſt be done by a perpetuall viſible Church, which you ſay (N.
34.) is not a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <pb n="843" facs="tcp:59214:437"/>article; and the ſame you
teach in divers other places of your Booke. You add, much leſſe can I
diſcover any ſhew of reaſon, <hi>why the whole Creeds containing all
things neceſſary ſhould mak the beliefe of a part of it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary.
As well, (for ought I vnder ſtand) you might auouch this inference to be as
good as Dr. Potters: The Apoſtles Creed containes all things neceſſary,
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for their is no need to belieue in God.</hi> But who makes any ſuch
generall or cauſall inference? Becauſe the whole Creed containes all things
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, therfor the beliefe of a part of it is vnneceſſary: rather
we muſt ſay the contrary; Becauſe it containes divers neceſſary
points, therfore the beliefe of divers of them is neceſſary. I hope you
will not deny this to be a good conſequence; the Creed containes all
neceſſary articles, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with ſome not neceſſary; Therfor the
beliefe of ſome part of it is not neceſſary. And I wonder you would
paralell our beliefe in God, with that of the Church, ſince the one is the
moſt neceſſary article of all others, and the other, in your opinion, is
not neceſſary. The reſt of your diſcourſe in this Number, ſerves
only to confirme the argument of <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> who never ſayd
abſolutely, that if the Apoſtles Creed containe all things neceſſary,
all other Creeds, and Catechiſmes are ſuperfluous, but expreſly called it
a poore conſequence, and yet that it was as good as Potters, which muſt be
to this effect: It is enough (vpon the Doctours ſuppoſition, not in truth)
or it is only neceſſary, to belieue the article of the Church, Therfor it
is ſuperfluous to belieue other articles contained in the Creed.</p>
               <p n="66">66. In your (N. 81.) you are pleaſed to ſpend words
in vaine. D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſays, <hi>As well, nay better, they might haue given vs
no article but that, and ſent vs to the Church for all the reſt.</hi> Ch.
Ma. having firſt proved, this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to be of no force; by way of
ſuperrogation, grants the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, not abſolutely, but thus farr
(which words you leaue out, and yet they overthrow all that you ſay here)
that, de facto, our B. Saviour 
<q rend="margQuotes">hath ſent vs to the Church; by her to
be taught, and by her alone: becauſe ſhe was before the Creed and
Scriptures; and ſhe to diſcharge this impoſed office of inſtructing vs

Eccleſiaſticall Traditions.</q> Thus Ch. Ma. hath granted you all that he
pretended to grant, as might haue been apparent, if you had not omitted his

make him to haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <pb n="844" facs="tcp:59214:438"/>
               <p n="67">67. Your (N. 82.83.) haue been anſwered already. For if
Dr. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meant, that the article of the Church, might be ſufficient, as
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all things neceſſary to be believed, and that therfor we needed
not the Creed, Ch. Ma. ſayth truly, it is no good argument; The Creed
containes not all things neceſſary, and that article of the Church, is in
rigour ſufficient; Therfor the Creed is not profitable: or if the Doctour
meant, that the article of the Church were enough, becauſe the Church
afterward, would teach all things by Creeds, or Catechiſmes &amp;c. that were
but to leaue the Creed, and afterward to come to it; and indeed to tell vs,
that the Church muſt doe that, which had beene done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and therfor in
what ſenſe ſoever you take the Doctours argument, it was confuted by Ch.
Ma. But now, while you pretend to ſtand for the ſufficiency of the Creed,
in all neceſſary points of beliefe, you doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed overthrow it, while you

as they haue written, wherin all the Articles of their Creed are plainly

if your doctrine weretrue, they had done a work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly more beneficiall to

but an imperfect comprehenſion of the neceſſary points of ſimple

that are true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and thoſe that are not ſo; but in ſteed
therof, had delivered this one propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which would haue been certainly

of faith.</hi> who ſees not that according to this diſcourſe of yours,
the Apoſtles aſſuring vs, that the ſcripture is infallible, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary points, de facto haue done as much ſervice to the
Church, as you ſay they would haue done, by that article, <hi>I belieue the
Roman Church ſhall be for ever infallible.</hi> For this evidence of
Scripture being ſuppoſed, you teach, that ther is no need of a guide or an
infallible Church, when the way is plaine of it ſelfe. And if,
notwithſtanding this your doctrine, of the ſufficiency of Scripture alone,
the Creed is not vnprofitable, and that the Apoſtles haue done better
ſervice to the Church, by giving vs both the Creed, and Scripture: So I
ſay, that one article of the Church, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the Creed, had been more
profitable, and of greater ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, then that Article alone; yea the Church,
as I ſayd, muſt haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered ſome Creed, and it was a great ſervice
to vs, that the Apoſtles had done it to her hand. If you deny this, you
muſt deny the Creed, <pb n="845" facs="tcp:59214:438"/>and Scripture, to be de facto more
profitable, then the Scripture alone, and ſo the Creed ſhall be of no
profit. For I ſuppoſe, if either the Creed, or Scripture be not profitable,
you will ſay it is the Creed, rather then the Scripture. If you ſay, the
articles of the Creed being <hi>clearly, but diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly ſet downe in the
Scripture,</hi> (as Potter ſpeakes) haue been afterwards <hi>ſummed vp and
contracted into the Apoſtles Creed,</hi> which therfor is of great vſe: I
reply, that by this anſwer, you teach vs to confute your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by
ſaying, that, as Scripture is too large for a Creed, or an abridgment, ſo
this one article of the Church, is too ſhort for a Creed, or abridgment of
Faith, and muſt haue been enlarged, by ſome Creed, Catheciſme, &amp;c.
And as Potter, and you, limited the promiſe of our Saviour, to the Church,
that the gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it, to fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
points, or to a ſufficient, but not a certainly effectuall aſſiſtance,
or ſome other way; the ſame would you haue done though he had ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Roman Church.</p>
               <p n="78">78. Your laſt (N. 84.) containes nothing in effect,
beſides what you and Potter haue ſaied, and hath been confuted already. We
deny not, but that the Creed, containes all fundamentall points in the

And you ſee he ſuppoſes all to be out of the Truth, who are out of the

ſo one might be in the Church, and not in the Truth. The example of the
Quartodecimani, who, by the ancient Fathers, are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among Hereticks,
makes directly againſt yourſelfe. Neither doth it import, that the
controverſie about keeping Eaſter, may ſeeme to be, only concerning a
circumſtance of time, and not immediatly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, of a revealed
Truth. For indeed, to ſay, it was neceſſary, to keepe Eaſter as the
Jewes did, for the circumſtance of time, was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall pernicious hereſy,
no leſſe, then to bring in a neceſſity of obſerving othr rites, of
the Jewiſh Law: and ſo the words, which you alleadge out of Petavius, make
nothing for you, againſt vs. For this cauſe, the obſervation of Eaſter,
at a certaine time, might be tolerated, as ſome rites of the Jewes were, till
they were affirmed to be neceſſary; after which time, they were to be
reputed, not only dead, but deadly: and ſo would that cuſtome, of keeping
Eaſter haue been, after it was pretended to be kept as neceſſary. Of
which point, and of the excommunication inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by holy Pope Uictor, <hi>Ch.

Fides ex auditu. And your ſelfe (Pag. 149. N. 38.) ſay, <hi>I muſt learne
of the Church or ſome part of the Church, or I cannot know that there was
ſuch a man as Chriſt, that he taught: ſuch Doctrine, that he and his
Apoſtles did ſuch miracles in confirmation of it, that the Scripture is
Gods word, vnles I be taught it. So then the Church is, though not a certain
Foundation and proofe of my Faith, yet a neceſſary intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to
it.</hi> How then doe you (N. 17.) aske this Queſtion? <hi>If ſome one
Chriſtian lived alone among Pagans in ſome country, remote from
Chriſtendom, ſhall we conceaue it impoſsible for this man to be ſaved,
becauſe he cannot haue recourſe to any cong regation for the affaires of
his ſoule?</hi> Seing yourſelfe tell vs, that you muſt <hi>learne of the
Church, or ſome part of it, or you cannot know that there was ſuch a man as
Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently you ſuppoſe, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian living among
Pagans, to haue learned of the Church the Chriſtian <pb n="849" facs="tcp:59214:440"/>Religion; wherein being once inſtructed he may afterward, be
ſaved, by an act of contrition, when he cannot actually receaue any
Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; and ſo he is not ſaved without dependance on the Church, of
which he firſt learned the Doctrine of Chriſt. Neither doe I ſay, that
every part, of the vniverſall Church, muſt alwayes be viſible to the
whole, but that every part, muſt be viſible to ſome, and ſo the whole
collection of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, will come to be viſible, in all places, and knowne
to the whole world. Yea, every particular Church, is of it ſelfe, viſible
to the whole, that is, from all parts of the Church, it may receaue writings,
letters, meſſages, and meſſengers, though it be not needfull, that
actually it doe ſo, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo be actually viſible to the whole, as I ſayd.
That the true Church cannot be without the preaching of the word, and right
adminiſtration of Sacraments, is the common Doctrine of Proteſtants; who
ſay they are eſſentiall notes of the Church, as hath been declared
hertofore. And though it were granted, that per accidens, theſe things could
not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually performed in ſome particular caſe (which yet indeed cannot
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, becauſe even the profeſſion of Faith is a reall preaching) that
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes nothing, to proue, that the vniverſall true Church, can be
inviſible, which in the greateſt perſecutions, was viſible, both to
friends, and foes, and became more conſpicuous, even by perſecution it
ſelfe. Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious S. Auſtin, brings ſo many, and ſo cleare texts of
Scripture, for the Amplitude, and Perpetuity of the Church, againſt the
Donatiſts, that you may bluſh, to ſpeake ſo contemptibly of his
Doctrine in this behalfe, as you doe (N. 16.) or to ſay, as you doe (N. 20.)
that it appeares not by his words, that he denyed not only the actuall
periſhing, of the Church, but the poſſibility of it; ſeing he vrges the
promiſes of God, and predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prophets, for the ſtability, and
perpetuity of Gods Church.</p>

not true:</hi> and that you belieue <hi>heate of diſputation againſt the

was neceſſary, and perhaps more than was true. As concerning the laſt
ſpeach of S. Auſtine, I cannot but wonder very much, why he ſhould think
it abſurd for any man to ſay, There are ſheepe which he knowes not, but
God knowes: and no less at you, for obtruding this ſentence vpon vs as

according to which, that which you mention, cannot be done by Scriptures alone,
as appeares by what we haue proved in divers places. For if the Church be

22.23.24.25.26.27.28.29.30.31.32.33.) either containes no difficulty, or hath
been anſwered already, in my chapter of Schiſme: Only I muſt entreate the
Reader, not to truſt your ſumming vp in your Number 24. the arguments of
<hi>Ch. Ma.,</hi> but to read them, in the Author himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. All that you haue (N. 37. and 38.) is anſwered out
of Dr. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters owne words (Pag. 76.) where ſpeaking of the Church of Rome he
ſayth; <hi>Her communion we forſake not, no more then the Body of Chriſt,
whereof we acknowledge the Church of Rome a member though corrupted: and this
cleares vs from the imputation of Schiſme, whoſe property it is
(witneſſe the Donatiſte and Luciferians) to cut of from the Body of
Chriſt, and the hope of ſalvation the Church from which it ſeparates. And
if any zelots among vs haue proceeded to heavier cenſures, their zeale may be
excuſed, but their Charity and Wiſdome can not be juſtified.</hi> Doe not
theſe words clearly declare, that one is not a Schiſmatick, if he
ſeparates from a Church in ſuch manner, as he doe not <hi>cut of from the
hope of ſalvation the Church from which he ſeparates;</hi> and that the
Donatiſts, and Luciferians, were not Schiſmaticks preciſely becauſe
they divided themſelves from the Church, but becauſe they added to their
ſeparation, the cutting of from the hope of ſalvation, the Church from
which they ſeparated? Two things then according to the Doctour, are
neceſſary and ſufficient, to incurre the ſinne of Schiſme; a
ſeparation, and a condemnation of that community, from which that diviſion
is made. For both D. Potter and thoſe zelots, agreed in a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 
<pb n="852" facs="tcp:59214:442"/>and in the pretended juſt cauſe therof (the
corruptions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church) and the only difference is the cutting or not
cutting her of from the hope of ſalvation; and conſequently, this cutting
of, is that which condemnes ſome of Schiſme, and cleares other from it,
though they agree in all the reſt; and ſo your example (that though one
ſymptome of the plague be a feaver, yet not every one that hath a feaver hath
the plague: becauſe he may by reaſon, (as you ſpeake) of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe
of other requiſits not haue the plague,) makes againſt your ſelfe, by
applying it; That as he who hath a feaver with other requiſits for a plague,
muſt haue the plague, ſo the cutting of from hope of ſalvation a Church,
and ſeparating from it, will make vp a compleat Schiſme; and then the
Syllogiſme, will not be that, which you make, againſt all good Logick, but
this: Whoſoever divides himſelfe from the Roman Church, and cuts it of from
the hope of ſalvation is a Schiſmaticke, but thoſe hoate Proteſtants of
whome you ſpeake, doe all this: Therfor they are Schiſmaticks. Yea, ſeing
Ch. Ma. (Pag. 190.191.) ſhewes, that even D. Potter doth alſo cut vs of
from hope of ſalvation, without repentance, by his owne rule, he makes
himſelfe guilty of formall Schiſme.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Your (N. 41.) is againſt Dr. Potter, who (Pag:
126.) teaches, that to limit the Church to the part of Donatus, was an
<hi>errour, in the nature and manner of it, hereticall againſt that Article
of the Creed, wherin we profeſſe to belieue the holy Catholick Church.</hi>
And for that other Article Remiſſion of ſinnes, ſeing by Holy Scripture
we learne, that ſome are elect to eternall happineſſe, which they cannot
attaine without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their ſinnes, it followes, that it is
an Article of Faith, not o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly that God <hi>will forgiue the ſinnes of all
that repent,</hi> as you ſay it may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but that de facto there
is Repentance, Remiſſion of ſinnes, and ſalvation. But theſe are not
Queſtions to be treated in this place: and by theſe examples it appeares,
to how little purpos you, and the Doctor will haue all fundamentall points of
Faith, to be contained in the Creed, ſeing you cannot agree, about the
meaning of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the words are but words. Your inſtance about
the ſtars, and ſunne, which doe not ceaſe to be, although they be not
alwayes viſible, is nothing to the purpoſe, vnless you could proue, that
perpetuall viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, is eſſentiall to the ſtarrs, or Sunne, as it is
to the true Church of Chriſt: and I might add, that they are alwayes
viſible to ſome people, and not wholy inviſible, as ſome Proteſtants
dreame, the Church to haue been inviſible, and withdrawen to the harts of
ſome particular <pb n="853" facs="tcp:59214:442"/>godly men, during the ſpace, of one

               <p n="12">12. Your (N. 42.43.) neede no anſwer. You will finde,
that the authority of S. Cyprian, to which <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> (N. 16. Pag: 161.)

thoſe, that eſteeme themſelves moderate Proteſtants, to communicate,
with thoſe other, who ſay, the Church periſhed; becauſe theſe being
formall He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes (according to Dr. Potter) and ſo out of the Church, it is
impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for thoſe other, to remaine in the true Church, and yet
communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them, who are out of the Church, according to the ſaied
words of S. Cyprian (Epiſt: 76. ad Mag.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">The Church is one, which being but one

thoſe other, who, by teaching an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, againſt the Article of the

You tell vs, that the ſaying of S. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath <hi>no more to doe with our

were to leaue the Colledge.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Vpon this errour, that externall communion, in

morally, and locally alſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to be preſent, at their publik
worſhip of God: nor doth he <hi>(C. Ma.) vſe any pretty Sophiſme, and
very fit to perſwade men that it is impoſsible for them to forſake any

if vices, and errours, were eſſentiall to a man, it were impoſſible, to

impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to forſake her externall communion, and not forſake her;

of which you ſpeake, ſeemes ſo cleare, that I belieue every Body will

the words of <hi>Ch. Ma.,</hi> ſo to impugne them more freely. His words are:

<q rend="margQuotes">When Luther appeared ther were not two
diſtinct viſible true Catholick Churches, holding contrary Doctrine, and
divided in externall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; one of the which true Churches did triumph
over all errour and corruption in doctrine and practice, but the other was
ſtained <pb n="856" facs="tcp:59214:444"/>with both. For to finde this diverſity of
churches ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſtand with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ds of Hiſtories, which are ſilent of any
ſuch matter. It is againſt Dr. Potters owne grounds, that the Church may
erre in points not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall. It contradicts the words in which he ſayd
(Pag: 155.) The Church may not hope to triumph over all ſinne and errour,
till ſhe be in Heaven. It evacuateth the brag of Proteſtants, that Luther
refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the whole Church.</q> Of theſe laſt words you ſay, <hi>Let it
be ſo, I ſee no harme will come of it.</hi> What indeed? Is it no harme,
that it may be ſayd with truth, that your Proteſtants are proved, bragging,
falſe Lyars, in ſaying Luther reformed the whole Church? But, (to omit
this) theſe words declare that <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> ſpeakes of two Churches,
wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one did triumph over all errour, and then adds, to find this
diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of two Churches cannot ſtand with records of Hiſtories &amp;c:
where the particles (this diverſity) are referred to two kinds of Churches,
wherof one did triumph over all ſinne and errour; and yourſelfe
expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the Doctors words ſay: <hi>To triumph over errour, is to be
ſecure from it, to be out of danger of it, not to be obnoxious to it.</hi>
This ſuppoſed, the objection is clearly of no force, wherin you ſay,
<hi>To ſuppoſe a viſible Church before Luther, which did not erre, is not
to contradict this ground of D. Potters, that the Church may erre. Vnless you
will haue vs belieue that May be and Muſt be is all one; which rule if it
were true, then ſure all men would be honeſt, becauſe all men may be
ſo. And you would not make ſo bad Arguments, vnless you will pretend you
cannot make better.</hi> But this whole objection, is grounded vpon concealing
the words of <hi>Ch. Ma.,</hi> who ſpoke of a Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing over all
errour, as we haue ſeene by his express words: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for when in the very
next conſequent period, he mentions a Church free from errour, it cannot be
otherwiſe vnderſtood, then of ſuch a freedome, as he ſpoke of
immediatly before, that is of a Church, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the true Church ought to
be) free from all danger of falling, into any leaſt errour, againſt Faith.
Beſides; ſuppoſe he had ſpoken of a Church, which defacto did not erre
in any point fundamentall, or not fundamentall, from the Apoſtles time to
Luther; it had been no ill argument, to inferr, that ſhe could not erre;
becauſe morally ſpeaking, and without a miracle, or particular
aſſiſtance, or infallible direction of the Holy Ghoſt, it had been
impoſſible, for ſo many men, in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages, of ſo different
diſpoſitions, through the whole world, to haue agreed in the ſame
beliefe, concerning matters, not evident of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but farr exceeding
the light of naturall reaſon, and ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie <pb n="857" facs="tcp:59214:444"/>to it; and therfor, if they had not been effectually preſerved from
errour, no doubt but ſome would haue fallen into it: which is ſo true, that
Dr. Potter ſayth (Pag, 39.) <hi>it is a great vanity to hope or expect that
all learned men, in this life, ſhould abſolutely conſent in all the
pieces, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of divine truth.</hi> The reſt of this Number hath
been particularly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered heretofore, and your weakning the ſtrength of
Hiſtorie, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſerves only, to call in queſtion all Religion,
in your ground, who belieue Scripture for tradition.</p>
               <p n="17">17. In your (N. 57.) you ſay to thoſe words of
<hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> (N. 18. <hi>Our Saviour foretold that there would be in the
Church tares with choice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>)
Looke again I pray, and you ſhall ſee, that the field he ſpeaks of, is
not the Church, but the world.</hi> Anſwer; <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> doth not (as
interpreting our Saviours Parable, Matth: 31.) ſaie, that the field he
ſpeaks of is the Church, but that he foretold, that there would be in the
Church tares with choiſe corne; which is very true, ſeing he expreſly
makes the parable of the kingdom of Heaven (which is the Church) ſaying,
<hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is reſembled to a man &amp;c.</hi> and the
amplitude of the word (world) doth not exclude the Church, for which, and her
Paſtours he gaue that wholeſome Document; Sinite vtraque creſcere, Let
both grow vp; and I pray, where but in the Church, can there be the wheat,
which our Saviour would not haue rooted out? And becauſe your owne
guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, moves you in this occaſion to tax Catholiques, becauſe they
puniſh obſtinate Heretiques; you ſhould reflect, that the tares are not
to be gathered, when there is danger, leaſt by ſo doing, the wheat may be
rooted out; and therfore, a contrario ſenſu, if there be no ſuch danger,
yea that by ſparing the cockle, the good corne, will ſuffer, the cockle is
rather to be taken away, than the corne deſtroied. In your (N. 58.) may be
obſerved a ſtrange kinde of ſaying, that God is <hi>infinitly mercifull
and therfor will not damne men for meer errours, who deſire to finde the
truth and cannot.</hi> Is it mercy not to damne men for that which is no fault?
And for which to damne one were injuſtice, and therfor not to doe it, is not
mercy, but juſtice.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Your (N. 59.60.) haue bene anſwered at large, in
the Chap: 7. about Schiſme. Neither can theſe propoſitions be defended
from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; <hi>The Church of Rome wants nothing neceſſary to
ſalvation, and yet it is neceſſary to ſalvation to forſake her.</hi>
For, as I haue proved, even he who believes ſhe erred, yet is ſuppoſed to
belieue that, notwithſtanding that error, ſtill ſhe wants nothing
neceſſary to ſalvation; and therefore the <pb n="858" facs="tcp:59214:445"/>diſtinction of perſons, whereof one believes ſhe errs, and the
other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſhe does not erre, cannot ſaue this contradiction.</p>
               <p n="19">19. That which you ſay (N. 61.) is answered by theſe
few lines. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hath promiſed to giue his ſufficient grace to
avoyd all dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly ſinne, and conſequently all damnable errour, as you
confeſſe every errour againſt any revealed Truth to be, vnles ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
excuſe it, which cannot happen, if, as you affirme, <hi>ſuch an
aſsiſtance is promiſed to vs as ſhall lead vs, if we be not wanting to
it and ourſelves, into all not only neceſſary but very proficable truth,
and guard vs from all, not only deſtructiue, but alſo hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
errours;</hi> becauſe this aſſiſtance ſuppoſed, the Church, if
ſhe fall into errour, muſt be wanting to herſelfe, and her ignorance can
not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, but culpable, and damnable both in it ſelfe, and to her;
and if her errours be damnable, ſhe wants ſome thing neceſſary to
ſalvation, that is, the true aſſent of Faith, contrary to that damnable
errour, and ſhe hath ſomething incompatible with ſalvation, namely, that
damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errour; and ſo indeed that truth, which you call only profitable,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes neceſſary, and that errour which you ſuppoſe to be only
hurtfull, is deſtructiue, if your Doctrine be ttue, that God gives
ſufficient Grace, to avoyd all ſortes of errour, and to lead to all very
profitable truths. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> further it followes, that you muſt recall your
Doctrine, and ſay, that if the Church may fall into errour not damnable to
her, it muſt be in caſe it be invincible, and yet it cannot be invincible,
if ſhe haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Aſſiſtance, to lead her into all, not only
neceſſary, but profitable truth, and therfore you muſt deny, that ſhe
hath ſuch an aſſiſtance, and we muſt conclude, that by not erring in
any fundamentall point, ſhe performes her duty to God, and ſo can not be
forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without Schiſme. For you doe not deny the propoſition of <hi>Ch:
Ma:</hi> (N. 20.) that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Communion of the Church, cannot be
forſaken, as long as ſhe performes the duty which ſhe oweth to God.
Beſides, how doe you not contradict yourſelfe,, in ſaying, <hi>Who is
ther that can put her in ſufficient caution, that theſe errours about
profitable matters may not bring forth others of higher quality, ſuch as are
pernicious and peſtilent, and vndermine by ſecret conſequences the very
Foundations of Religion and piety?</hi> For if the errours be ſuch as you
deſcribe, they come to be concerning things, not only profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but
neceſſary, as vndermining the very foundations of Religion: and therfor to
ſay ſhe erres culpably in them, is to ſay that ſhe erres dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, and
fundamentally; and you muſt ſay, ſhe erres culpably, if ſhe haue
aſſiſtance ſufficient to avoid them. By this diſcourſe, and other 
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:59214:445"/>points handled heretofore, is anſwered your (N. 62.63.)
as alſo your (N. 64.65.66.67.68.69.70.71.72.73,) only it is to be obſerved,
that (N. 64.) you paralell the ſecurity of private men from errour, in
fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls, to that of the vniverſall Church. And (N. 68.) you will not
ſee the reaſon of a conſequence, deduced by <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> which had
been very cleare, if you had ſet downe his words, which are theſe: (N. 22.
P. 185.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Since it is not lawfull to leaue the
communion of the Church for abuſes in life and manners, becauſe ſuch
miſeries cannot be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this world of temptation: and ſince
according to your Aſſertion, no Church may hope to triumph over all ſinne
and errour (and I add what the Doctour ſayth (Pag: 39.) that it is a great
vanity, to hope, or expect, that all learned men, in this life ſhould
abſolutely conſent, in all the pieces of Divine truth) you muſt grant,
that as ſhe ought not to be left, by reaſon of ſinne; ſo neither by
reaſon of errours not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, becauſe both ſinne and errour are
(according to you) impoſſible to be avoided, till ſhe be in heaven: and
that it is a great vanity to hope or expect the contrary in this life.</q> And
is not this a cleare conſequence? The Church cannot be forſaken for
ſinnes, becauſe they cannot be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this life, therfor, seing
errours, at leaſt in not fundamentalls, cannot be avoyded in this life, the
Church cannot be forſaken for them.</p>
               <p n="20">20. To your (N. 72.) it is ſufficient to ſay, that
although we <hi>muſt not doe evill to avoide evill,</hi> yet when a
poſition is ſuch, as evill cannot but follow of it, ex natura rei, it is a
clear argument, that ſuch a Poſition includes falſhood, and errour. Now
as <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> proves (N. 24.) your grounds doe, of their owne nature,
giue scope to perpetuall Schiſmes, and diviſions: And then the
conſequence is cleare, that they are falſe and erroneous. His words (which
you by abbreviating make ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) are: 
<q rend="margQuotes">they (who ſeparate themſelves) will
anſwet as you doe prompt, that your Church may be forſaken, if ſhe fall
into errours, though they be not Fundamentall; and further that no Church
muſt hope to be free from ſuch errours: which two grounds being once layd;
it will not be hard to inferr, the conſequence, that ſhe may be
forſaken.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. All that (N. 74.75.76.77.) you vtter with too much
heate, is anſwered, by putting you in minde, that <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> never
affirmes, that Proteſtants ſay, the cauſe of their ſeparation, and
their motiue to it, was (abſolutely and independently of any ſeparation)
preciſely becauſe they did not cut her of from hope of ſalvation (as you
impoſe vpon him) for which fooliſh reaſon even Catholiks might be ſayd
to be Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, <pb n="860" facs="tcp:59214:446"/>from their owne Church, becauſe
they are ſure ſhe is not cut of from hope of ſalvation) but that,
ſuppoſing their ſeparation from vs vpon other cauſes (for example,
pretended corruptions) they pretend to be excuſed from Schiſme, and ſay
they did well to forſake her, becauſe they doe not hold, that ſhe is cut
of from hope of ſalvation. Which to be true, he <hi>(C: Ma:)</hi> ſhewes
out of Potters words. And yourſelfe (P. 284 N 75.) ſay to C: Ma: <hi>can
you not perceaue a difference betweene juſtifying his ſeparation from
Schiſme, by this reaſon and making this the reaſon of his
ſeparation.</hi> And whoſoever reads Ch: Ma: [N. 27.] will finde, that
which I ſay to be true. For he expreſly ſayth, that both they who doe,
and doe not, cut of the Church of Rome, from hope of ſalvation, agree in the
effect of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Only this effect of ſeparation being ſuppoſed
(without which ther could be no imaginable Schiſme) they doe alleadge for
their excuſe, that they did it in a different manner, becauſe the one part,
of which we ſpeake, conceaved that, though they did ſeparate, yet they
ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from Schiſme, becauſe they did not cut of, from hope
of ſalvation, the Roman Church: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo, this was the motiue, or reaſon,
for which they judged, they might ſeparate from her, without the ſinne of
Schiſme, and conſequently, they would not haue done it, if they had not had
this reaſon, or motiue, and conſideration, wherby to excuſe
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thus your examples of one ſaying to his Brother, I doe well to
leaue you, becauſe you are my Brother, or of a ſubject, ſaying to his
Soveraigne Lord, I doe well to diſobey you, becauſe I acknowledge you to be
my lawfull Soveraigne, are meere perverſions of <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> his words,
who ſayth truly againſt Potter, that if one ſhould part from his Brother
vpon ſome cauſe, and excuſe ſuch his departure from fault, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſtill acknowledges him to be his Brother, or if a ſubject ſhould
diſobey his Soveraigne, vpon ſome motiue, and then ſhould thinke to
juſtify his fact, by ſaying, he ſtill acknowledges him, to be his lawfull
Soveraigne, C: Ma: I ſay affirmes, that ſuch an excuſe, may juſtly
ſeeme very ſtrange, and rather fit to aggravate, then to extenuate, or
excuſe the departure, of the one, from his Brother, and diſobedience, of
the other, to his Souveraigne. And yet this is our caſe. For, both the
violent, and moderate Proteſtants, agree in the ſame effect of
ſeparation, from the Roman Church, and disobedience to her Paſtours, with
this only difference, that the one ſorte, ſayth, that ſhe is cut of from
the hope of Salvation, and the other ſayes ſhe is not, and pretend to be
excuſed from Schiſme, becauſe they ſay ſo, though they ſeparate
themſelves <pb n="861" facs="tcp:59214:446"/>from her, no leſſe, then the other
doe.</p>
               <p n="22">22. To your (N. 78.79.) I anſwer, that when the
Fathers, and Divines, teach, that ſchiſme is a diviſion fro that church,
with which one agrees in matters of faith, they doe not diſtinguiſh,
betweene points fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntall, in order to the negatiue
precept, of not disbelieving any point ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly propoſed as revealed by
God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo in fact, all points being fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall, in this ſenſe (as
both you, and Potter are forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe more then once, though in
other occaſions you contradict it, as even in this place you make ſuch a
diſtinction, and vpon it ground your objection) whoſoever agree truly in
all Fundamentall points in this ſenſe, agree in all points, of truths,
revealed by God, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently propoſed for ſuch. If Proteſtants
will faine to themſelves, another kinde of points, not fundamentall, in order
to the Negatiue precept of Faith, <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> is not obliged to
ſide with them, but may and ought to ſay, that if Proteſtants pretend to
agree with vs, in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Points, they muſt a parte rei agree with vs,
in all Points, ſufficiently propoſed as divine Truths, and that agreement
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, while they depart from our Communion, they beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt
formall Schiſmatiks, as Schiſme is diſtinguiſhed from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy. Thus
your Sillogiſme (which you pretend to reſemble the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ch:
Ma</hi>) is anſwered. For when you ſay; <hi>He that obeyes God in all
things, is innocent; Titus obeys God in ſomethings; Therefore he is
innocent.</hi> Your Minor ſhould be, Titus obeys God in all things, as they
who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in fundamentall points of Faith, muſt agree in all things, that
is, they muſt not diſagree in any revealed truth; for to agree in that
ſenſe, is fundamentall to the Faith of a Chriſtian, as Potter
confeſſes. By this alſo your (N. 79.) is anſwered. Neither doe your (N.
80. and 81.) containe any difficulty, which is not anſwered by a meere
denyall. I wiſh the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for his owne good, to reade what you omitt in the
(N. 29.) of <hi>C: Ma:</hi> where he ſhewes, that Luther was farr enough from
intending any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, with ſome other points, which you omitt, or
involue in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and which being read in him, anſwer all your
Objections.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Your (N. 82.) gives as great a deadly blow to
Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as no adverſary could haue give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a greater. C: Ma:
ſayd, that Luther, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his Aſſociates, did wholy disagree in the
particulars of their reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; which was a ſigne, that the thing vpon
<hi>which theyr thoughts firſt pitched was not any particular Modell or Idea
of Relig o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but a ſettled reſolution to forſake the Church of Rome.</hi>
This you not only grant, but proue, that it could not <pb n="862" facs="tcp:59214:447"/>be
otherwiſe, ſaying to <hi>Ch Ma. Certainly it is no great marveile that ther
was as you ſay, diſagreement between them in the particulars of their
Reformation: Nay morally ſpeaking it was impoſsible it ſhould be
otherwiſe.</hi> And why? You giue the reaſon, in theſe remarkable words:
<hi>the Declination from which</hi> (originall purity of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <hi>ſome
conceaving to haue begunne though ſecretly in the Apoſtles times the
myſtery of iniquity being then in worke; and after their departure to haue
ſhewed itſelfe more openly: others againe believing that the Church
continued pure for ſome ages after the Apoſtles, and then declined: And
conſequently, ſome ayming at an exact conformity with the Apoſtolique
times: others thinking, they ſhould doe God and men good ſervice could they
reduce the Church to the condition of the fourth and fift ages: ſome taking
their direction in this worke of Reformation, only from Scripture; others from
the writings of Fathers, and the decrees of Councells of the firſt fiue Ages:
certainly it is no great mervaile that ther was, as you ſay, diſagreement
between them, in the particulars of their Reformation; nay morally ſpeaking
it was impoſsible it ſhould be otherwiſe. Yet let me tell you, the
difference between them (eſpecially in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of your Church and
Religion) is not the difference between good and bad, but between good and
better. And they did beſt, that followed Scripture interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Catholick
written Tradition: which Rule the reformers of the Church of England propoſed
to themſelves to follow.</hi> I know not, whether the vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or
miſery, of Proteſtant religion, could haue been deſcribed in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re lively
colours, then you haue ſet it out. For if they be vncertaine, from whence to
beginne their Reformation, and for that cauſe, you confeſſe it was
impoſſible for them not to diſagree in the particulars therof, it
followes, that now they haue no certainty, what Reformation is true, or whether
a Reformation, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not rather a Deformation, or falſhood And indeed the
different heades, even as you propoſe them, are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, that it is
not eaſy to vnderſtand, what they meane: and then, how hard muſt it be,
to take them for a diſtinct rule, how to proceed, in the Reformation of the
whole world! If the principles be doubtfull, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion can not be
certain. You make your Progenitours, to reſemble perfectly, the Genethliaci
and judicarij Aſtrologers, who not agreeing in their Principles, proue vaine,
and ridiculous in their predictions. You are like to a certaine man, who not
long a goe, in a citty, which I could name, apprehending himſelfe in his
climactericall yeare, could not be induced to eate, as despayring to paſſe
that Criticall time, till he was told by a witty Phyſition, that he muſt
count his age, from the time of his conception, not of his nativity, as he had
done, according to which <pb n="863" facs="tcp:59214:447"/>rate, finding, as he thought,
his fatall yeare to be paſt, was preſently cured. Truly whoſoever
adviſedly, and ſeriouſly, conſiders this Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of yours, can not but
forſake Proteſtantisme, if he meane not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his owne ſoule. You
endeavoured, to perſwademen, that by the ordinary meanes, which are left vs,
a Church collapſed, may be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to purity, which certainly you make
impoſſible to be done, by the Doctrine you deliver here; Seing,
confeſſedly ther is no certainty, vpon what Grounds, or by what ſettled
directions, ſuch a Reformation ſhould proceed; nor from whence it ſhould
beginne. It is alſo ſtrange to heare you ſay; <hi>They did beſt that
followed Scripture interpreted by Catholick writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Tradition: Which Rule the
Reformers of the Church of England propoſed to themſelves to follow.</hi>
What? doe you now tell vs, that there be traditiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of
Scripture? A thing diſclaymed by you, through your whole booke, denying all
other Traditions except that, wherby we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Scripture, as the word of God,
but not the interpretation of it, it being (as you ſaie) evident of
itſelfe, and ther being no infallible Judge to declare it, or any points of
Faith which are not contained in it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over by what commiſſion, or
coherence to yourſelf, ſay you, (Pag: 375. N. 56.) <hi>That the Bible, I
ſay the Bible only, is the Religion of Proteſtants?</hi> Seing you tell vs
here, that <hi>ſome of them tooke their direction in this work of
Reformation, only from Scripture; others from the Writings of the Fathers, and
the Decrees of the Councells, for the firſt fiue Ages: and</hi> that <hi>they
did beſt, that followed Scripture interpreted by Catholick written
Tradition?</hi> Heere, yourſelfe expresſly diſtinguiſh, thoſe who
tooke their direction only from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from others, who tooke it from the
Writings of the Fathers, and the Decrees of Councells &amp;c. The truth is you
vndertooke to defend Potter, and Proteſtants, only to haue the occaſion of
venting Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, and covertly overthrowing Proteſtantiſme, and vpon
grounds, which indeed overthrow all Religion. You say; <hi>Let me tell you the
difference between them (eſpecially in compariſon of your Church and
Religion) is not the difference between good and bad, but between good and
better:</hi> Answer: in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, of two diſagreeing, the one muſt
be in an errour, againſt Divine Teſtimony, and the other in the right. I
hope you will not say, that the difference betweene an Aſſent of Faith, and
an errour againſt Faith, is <hi>not between good and bad,</hi> but between
good and better, as if er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour againſt Faith were good, but not so good, as
Faith. Now thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent capitall Principles, of which you ſpoke, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
chuſe but produce different, and oppoſite concluſions, and Doctrines of
which one muſt be an errour.</p>
               <pb n="864" facs="tcp:59214:448"/>
               <p n="24">24. In your (N. 83.84.85.86.87.89.90.91.92.93.94.95.96.)
you ſpend many words, with much vnneceſſary fervour againſt the
ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers which <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> gives to two ſimilitudes, which D. Potter
brings to excuſe Proteſtants from the guilt of Schiſme: which
ſimilitudes you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in a curſiffe letter; but add words of importance,
which the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour hath not. His words faithfully alledged by Ch: Ma. (P. 194.
N. 30) taken out of the Doctours (P: 81. 82.) are theſe: <hi>If a monaſtery
ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it ſelfe, and ſhould reduce into practice, ancient good
diſcipline, when others would not, in this caſe could it in reaſon be
charged with Schiſme from others, or with Apoſtaſie from its rule, and
order? Or as in a Society of men vniverſally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with ſoxie
diſeaſe, they that ſhould free themſelves from the common diſeaſe,
could not be therfor ſayd to ſeparate from the Society: ſo neither can
the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches be truly accuſed for making a Schiſme from the
Church, ſeing all they did was to reforme themſelves.</hi> You say this
argument is preſſing, and vnanswerable. But, Examples, and ſimilitudes,
are commonly ſayed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to illuſtrate, then demonſtrate, and are
often more captious, then ſolid, and convincing. You haue no reaſon to
accuſe Ch: Ma: for perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them; for he firſt set downe the very words
of Potter, and then ſets downe the caſe, with application to our preſent
purpoſe, never affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that the Doctour sets it downe, in the manner, and
in thoſe words, but contrarily, ſhewing, that it ſhould be ſo set
downe; which appeares by his express words (N. 31. <hi>Before you make your
finall reſolution heare a word of advice</hi>) And (N. 32.) <hi>Let me ſet
before you theſe conſiderations.</hi> All which words, in both theſe
places, declare manifeſtly, that Ch: Ma: did not pretend to set downe
verbatim the Doctours caſe, but to ſignify, what he ought to haue
conſidered, and set downe, and what de facto paſt in the diviſion of
Luther from the Church. And laſtly, he ſhewes, that the caſe, being set
downe, as it ought to haue been, made againſt the Doctour, in favour of his
adverſary. That all this is true, will appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are by reading the discourſe of
Ch: Ma: [N. 31.32.33.34.]</p>
               <p n="25">25. And it was eaſy for <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> to retort the
ſimilitudes, out of theſe grounds, which he had proved: That there is a
moſt ſtrict divine command, not to forſake the communion of Gods Church;
Dr. Potter (Pag; 76.) ſayes: <hi>Whoſoever profeſſeth himſelfe to
forſake the communion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one member of the Body of Chriſt, muſt
confeſſe himſelfe conſequently to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the whole; and therfor
her</hi> (the Roman Churches) <hi>communion we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake not, no more then the
Body of Chriſt:</hi> And that externall communion, is eſſentiall, to make
men members, of the ſame Church: which he (<hi>Ch. <pb n="865" facs="tcp:59214:448"/>Ma.</hi>) ſhewes (Pag: 155. N. 5) and I haue proved heretofore.
For, out of theſe two grounds, it followes, That it is de Jure Divino, not to
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the communion of the Church, which according to Dr. Potter, were to
forſake the body of Chriſt, and that to forſake the externall communion,
which is eſſentiall to the Church, is to forſake the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the
Church. Now, the ſimilitudes of the Doctor, to be of any force, muſt
ſuppoſe that ther is no divine command, to remaine in that Monaſtery, or
company of thoſe infected perſons, or elſe, that to leaue their externall
communion, were not to leaue them; and ſo, in one word, the parity muſt be
abſolutely denyed; ſeing it is ſuppoſed, that ther is no divine precept
for remayning in that Monaſtery, or Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall of ſick people, or elſe,
that to remaine in their company, were not eſſentiall to be a member of
ſuch communities; and therfor you ſay ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry irreligiouſly (N. 84.) That
as it is poſſible to forſake other Societies, that is, their externall
communion, ſo alſo it may be Lawfull to forſake the communion of the
Church, for her pretended faults, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But let vs ſee, what you
can object; and I muſt here againe entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te the Reader, to read <hi>Ch:
Ma.</hi> and not take his anſwers, not only at a ſecond, but at an
adverſaries hand. For here you practice an art, firſt to divide the
Reaſons of <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> and then to ſet vpon every ſingle one a
parte, wheras there is ſuch a connexion between his reaſons, that one
receaves light, and ſtrength from another. It ſeemes you haue a minde to
cavill, when you would ſeeme to make a difference, between one Monaſterie
compared with other Monaſteries of the ſame order, and one, or ſome few
perſons, compared with the one Monaſterie in which they liue: Wheras you
cannot but judge that there is the ſelfsame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and that the
reaſon, which may excuſe, or accuſe, in the one, may doe the like, in the
other, or rather indeed, it is but one, and the ſelfe ſame caſe, for as
much as belongs to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="26">26. You (N. 85.) in ſtead of a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwering the caſe as
<hi>C. Ma.</hi> puts it, profeſſe to alter it, and to put it not juſt as
<hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> would haue it. Well, even ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the caſe as you put it, I
ſay, that if there were, as ther is in our caſe, a divine command, not to
part from ſuch a community, thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances, which you ſuppoſe to
be obliging, would ceaſe to oblige, if they could not be kept, without
forſaking ſuch a community: yea, though they did ſtill oblige, it were
not Lawfull, to leaue that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as I declared heretofore, in caſe of
minoris mali, and perplexity. <pb n="866" facs="tcp:59214:449"/>But indeed <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi>
ſpeakes not of obſervances, the omitting wherof did import ſinne, but in
express termes, 
<q rend="margQuotes">of a caſe, wherin a Monaſtery did
confeſſedly obſerue their ſubſtantiall vowes, and all principiall
Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, or conſtitutions of the order, though withſome neglect of
leſſer Monaſticall Obſervances.</q> Neither is the ſtreame of
Caſuiſts againſt <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> in this; nor S. Paul, whome you cite,
while he ſayes, that we may not doe the leaſt evill, that we may doe the
greateſt good: Seing in this caſe, the omiſſion of thoſe
obſervances, would be ſo farr from being evill, that the contrary would be
a great offence, againſt God, and his Church. This very ſame anſwer,
ſerves for your other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, about a company, vniverſally infected
with ſome diſeaſe, and needs only the application, from obſervance, to
a diſeaſe, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſhould rather endure, then make a breach,
from ſuch a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if by a divine precept, we be obliged to remaine
therein.</p>
               <p n="27">27. You cite (N. 87.) the words of Ch: Ma.
diſadvantagiouſly. He ſayth indeed, that thoſe few that pretended a
Reformation, <hi>were knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be led not with any ſpirit of Reformation,
but by ſome other ſiniſter intention;</hi> which is very true. And (N.
29.) he ſhewed it out of Luthers owne words, which you thought fit to
diſſemble: and the ſame may be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of your other primitiue,
prime, Reformers, if it were neceſſary. It is alſo very true, that by
going out of the Church, no man muſt hope to be free from <hi>thoſe or the
like errours, for which they left her.</hi> For they may returne to morrow, to
their former opinions, as hereſy is always inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and alſo to vs
Catholiques; becauſe out of the true Church; they can haue no certaine rule
of Faith, nor are aſſiſted with plenty of grace, for exerciſing acts
thereof, as experience teaches vs, in the irreconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contentions of
Proteſtants, and yourſelfe ſay heere (P: 277. N. 61.) <hi>The vſuall
fecundity of errours is to bring forth others of a higher quality, ſuch as
are pernicious and peſtilent, and vndermine by ſecret conſequences the
very foundations of Religion and piety.</hi> It is pretty, to heare you ſay,
(N. 88.) that the Church is ſecured from fundamentall errours, not by any
abſolute <hi>promiſe of divine aſsiſtance, but by the repugnance of any
errour fundamentall to the eſſence and nature of a Church,</hi> as you may
ſay, men are ſecured from being vnreaſonable creatures, or beaſtes,
becauſe if they were ſuch, they could not be men. You know very well that
when Charity Maintayned ſayd, (N. 31.) <hi>You teach that no particular
perſon or Church hath any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of aſsiſtance in points
fundamentall</hi>) he meant of an abſolute promiſe of <pb n="867" facs="tcp:59214:449"/>aſſiſtance, which Potter affirmes the vniverſall Church to
haue, for all fundamentall points, and yet grants it not to any particular
Perſon, or Church, and therefor you had no reaſon to call that true saying
of Ch: Ma: <hi>a manifeſt falſhood.</hi> Of Luthers oppoſing himselfe to
all, I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heretofore, and anſwered the objection, you bring about
that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in your (N. 89.)</p>
               <p n="28">28. Your (N. 91.) yealds as much as can be deſired,
againſt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all Proteſtants, That <hi>many chiefe learned
Proteſtants are forced to confeſſe the antiquity of our doctrine and
practice;</hi> which you doe not deny; but goe about to ſpecify some
particular points, of which learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants doe not confeſſe the
antiquity; but indeed they are ſuch, that any judicious Proteſtant, will
wonder, that you did mention them in particular, confeſſing therby, that
for thoſe which you doe not expreſſe (and they are the chiefeſt
differences betwixt Proteſtants and vs) anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſtands for vs, againſt
Proteſtants: though I muſt add withall, to make vp the number, you are
forced, to bring in ſome things, which are not matters of Faith with vs, and
ſome other points, which are even ridiculous. We deny, that any Catholick
approved Authour, acknowledges the novelty of any of our Doctrines, or the
Antiquity of yours, except in that ſenſe, as we are wont to ſay, ſuch,
were Ancient Hereſies, and Heretikes. But you know Eraſmus is no competent
witneſſe in our account. Your (Num. 72.) containes no new diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
               <p n="29">29. To your (N. 93.) In anſwer; that the Profeſſion
of true Faith, is eſſentiall to every member of the Church, as ſuch, but
Charity is not: and therfor every errour againſt Faith, is incompatible with
ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, but not ſinnes againſt Charity. If the Church might
erre in any point of Faith, it is true, that, ex natura rei, and conſidering
only that errour, or only that one part of the ſuppoſition, in itſelfe,
her communion might be forſaken; and yet it is alſo true, that taking into
conſideration all ſides, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d comparing the greater Inconvenience, of
lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the communion of the Church, with a leſſer of profeſſing an
errour not Fundamentall, it is neceſſary, to remaine in her communion, as
minus malum, and therefore, in caſe, and ſuppoſition, of perplexity (not
abſolutely, and per ſe loquendo) to be perferred, and choſen: ſo the
ſaying of <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> that the Church might be forſaken, if ſhe
could fall into any errour againſt Faith, is true per ſe loquendo, and not
contrary to his other ſaying, that vpon that impoſſible ſuppoſition,
it were leſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; <pb n="868" facs="tcp:59214:450"/>and therfor in caſe of
perplexity, neceſſary not to forſake her: all which I explicated
heretofore at large. For avoyding of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable Labyrinths, and
perplexities, and taking away all ſhadow of contradiction, we muſt belieue,
the Church to be infallible, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from all errour againſt
Faith.</p>
               <p n="30">30. All that you haue (N. 94.) hath been anſwered
heretofore, when we ſhewed that to depart from the externall communion of the
Church, was to depart from the Church. Your (N. 97) containes no difficulty,
except againſt yourſelf, who cannot avoide the Authority brought by Char.
Main. out of S. Optatus, except by ſaying, his ſayings are not rules of
Faith; and I deſire the Reader, to peruſe the words of <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> (N.
35.) that the Proteſtants departed from the Roman Church, and not the Roman
Church from them, with ſome other reflections of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="31">31. In your (N. 98.) you grant the thing which Ch. Ma:
affirmes, that the Primacie <hi>if Peter is confeſſed by learned
Proteſtants to be of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and for which the judgment of divers
moſt ancient Fathers is reproved by them, as may be ſeene in Brereley</hi>
(Tract: 1. Sect. 3. Subdivis. 10.) Which, to ſuch as beare due reſpect, to
the agreement, of ſo many ancient, learned, and holy Fathers, ought to proue
that it is, not only ancient, but true. And I wonder you can ſay, that
<hi>having peruſed Brereley you cannot find any one Proteſtant confeſsing
any one Father to haue concurred in opinion with vs,</hi> that the Popes
Primacy is de Jure Divino, wheras he cites divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
confeſſing (forced by evedence of Truth) that divers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers proved that
Primacy, out of the Power given, and Promiſe made by our Saviour to S. Peter,
and that vpon Him he builded his Church. And to ſpeak Truth, it is no better
than ridiculous, to imagine, that all other Churches, did, or would or could in
prejudice to the Authority of particular Churches, confer vpon the ſea of
Rome, an vniverſall power over them all, to admitt Appeales againſt them,
to reverſe their decrees &amp;c. vnless they had believed, ſuch a Power to
haue bene granted by a Higher power. We ſee how zealously every one is bent,
to preſerue his owne Right, and is more inclined, to deny what is due to an
other, than to giue vp his owne. And when, or where, did all Churches,
vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly and joyntly, offer vp this vniverſall ſupreme Authority, to the
Biſhop of Rome?</p>
               <p n="32">32. To the authority cited by Ch: Ma: out of S. Cyprian
(Epiſt. 55.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Hereſies haue ſprung, and
Schiſmes been bred from no other cauſe, <pb n="869" facs="tcp:59214:450"/>than for that
the Prieſt of God is not obeyed, nor one Prieſt and Judge is conſidered
to be for the time in the Church of God;</q> You answer that S. Cyprian spoke
not of Cornelius but of Himself, and yet you confess (N. 91.) that Goulartius a
learned Proteſtant, grants that it is meant of Cornelius, and Pamelius in his
Annotations vpon this Epiſtle of S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian brings divers Arguments to proue
the same: Neither can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed but that in his Booke de Vnitate
Eccleſiae, he affirmes Hereſies to spring from not acknowledging one Head,
S. Peter. vpon whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour builded his Church: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Super illum vnum aedificat Eccleſiam
ſuam. Primatus Petro datur, vt vna Chriſti Eccleſia, &amp; Cathedra vna
mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretur.</q> Which is ſo manifeſt, that the Proteſtant Chroniclers,
(cent. 3. col. 84. lin. 59.) ſay, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Paſſim dicit Cyprianus super Petrum
Eccleſiam fundatam eſſe,</q> vr Lib. 1. Epiſt: 3. (which is the
Epiſtle cited by C. Ma. and of which we now speak) And Lib: 4. Epiſt: 9.
&amp;c. But although it were granted, that S. Cyprian in his Epiſt 55. did
speak of a particular Church, it is cleare, that for avoiding Schiſme in the
whole Church, there is a neceſſity of one Head, if for that cauſe one
Head be neceſſary in every particular Church, as heretofore we cited out of
S. Hierom, that among the Apoſtles one was choſen, 
<q rend="margQuotes">vt capite conſtituto Schiſmatis
tolleretur occaſio.</q> And even Dr. Covell a learned Proteſtant in his
exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination &amp;c. saieth; <hi>How can they think that equality would keepe
all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in the world in peace and vnity. For in all Societies
Authority (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be where all are equall) muſt procure vnity and
obedience. Otherwiſe the Church ſhould be in a farre worſe caſe, then
the meaneſt commonwealth.</hi> To which purpoſe he alledges that Sentence,
which we mentioned out of S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, 
<q rend="margQuotes">vt capite conſtituto Schiſmatis
tolleretur occaſio.</q> You say; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the words of S. Cyprian
<hi>condemne Luther, is another Queſtion.</hi> Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; If thoſe words
condemne Luther of Schiſme, for withdrawing his Obedience from the Pope
(which Ch: Ma: affirmes, and you for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent do not deny) it evidently
implies, that the Pope was Superiour, to him, and all other Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="33">33. In your (N. 99.100.) you labour to elude theſe
words of S. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus (alledged by C. Ma: in the ſame N. 36.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Thou canſt not deny, but that thou
knoweſt, that in the Citty of Rome, there was firſt an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall chaire
placed for Peter, wherin Peter the head of all the Apoſtles ſat, whereof
alſo he was called Cephas; in which one chaire, vnity was to be kept by all,
leaſt the other Apoſtles might attribute to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, each one his
particular chaire; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that he ſhould be a Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que 
<pb n="870" facs="tcp:59214:451"/>and a ſinner, who againſt that one ſingle Chaire
ſhould erect an other.</q> (lib: 2. cont: Parmen:) You tell vs; That <hi>the
Donatiſts had ſet vp at Rome a Biſhop of their faction, and that Optatus
proves them Schiſmatikes for ſo doing, vpon this ground, of one Biſhop in
one Church.</hi> But whoſoever reads Optatus, will clearly ſee, that he
expreſly ſpeaks of the Catholique (not of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) Church, which he
ſaieth, hath quinque ornamenta or dotes, the firſt whereof is a chaire, on
which chaire (of the Catholique and vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church) he ſaith S. Peter
firſt ſat, whom he calls the <hi>Head of all the Apoſtles, whereof he was
called Cephas; in which one Chaire, vnity was to be kept by all.</hi> Now I
beſeech you, is it not cleare, that Optatus ſpeaks of S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of his
Sea, not as of a particular Biſhop, of a particular Church, but as Head of
the Catholique Church, by whoſe meanes vnity was to be conſerved, and that
Schiſme, and Hereſie are to be diſcovered, by oppoſition to that
chayre? which he calls ſingularem cathedram, and may well ſignify not only
a ſingle, or particular, or individuall chaire, but indeed ſingular, by
reaſon of ſingular preeminence, and priviledg aboue all other Churches. For
this cauſe, he ſpeaks thus to the Donatiſt Parmenian: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Contra quas portas (inferorum) claves
ſalutares accepiſſe legimus Petrum, cui a Chriſto dictum eſt, Tibi
dabo claves regni Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, &amp; portae inferorum non vincenteas. Vnde eſt
ergo quod claves regni vobis vſurpare contenditis, qui contra cathedram
Petri, veſtris preſumptionibus &amp; audacijs, ſacrilegio militatis?</q>
To what purpoſe ſhould he inſiſt, vpon theſe priviledges of S. Peter,
and his Chaire, if he meant no more than what is common to all particular
Churches? Or how doth he afterward proue, that they whom the Donatiſts
oppoſed were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in
Eccleſia Sancta Catholica, per Cathedram Petri, quae noſtra eſt? But why
do I labour, to proue, that which our Adverſaries, your Brethren, are forced
to grant? For the Centuriſts (cent 4. col. 556. lin. 17.) alledg Optatus
calling Peter, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Apoſtolorum caput, vnde &amp; Cephas
appellatur.</q> And indeed not only in the place alledged, but alſo (lib: 7.)
he calls S. Peter caput Apoſtolorum, And Fulk (in his Retentiue, Pag: 248.)
char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Optatus with abſurdity, for ſaying of Peter, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Praeferri Apoſtolis omnibus meruit
&amp;c <hi>He deſerved to be preferred before all the Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </q>
You ſay; When Optatus <hi>ſtiles S. Peter head of the Apostles, and
ſayes, that from thence he was called Cephas; Perhaps he was abuſed into
this opinion, by thinking Cephas derived from the greek word Kephale: wheras it
is a Syriack word and ſigniſies a ſtone.</hi> But what imports it vpon
what ground he called him head, ſeing he called him ſo, and believed him to
be ſuch? Beſide, <pb n="871" facs="tcp:59214:451"/>that which is the ſtone, Rock, or
Foundation, in a materiall Building, in a myſticall Body is the Head, as the
vulgar ſaying is, Homo eſt arbor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa, The roote is to a tree, as the
Head is to a man; and therefore our Saviour ſayd, I will build my Church vpon
this Rock, after he had ſaied to S. Peter, that he was a Rock. In this manner
the Centuriſts, Cent: 3. col: 85. ſay, that Origines (Tract: 5. in Matth:) 
<q rend="margQuotes">dicit, Petrus per pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionem
meruit fieri Eccleſiae fundamentum, and yet that (Hom: 17, in Lucam) Petrum
vocat Apoſtolorum Principem,</q> where we ſee that S. Peter is called both
a Foundation, and a Prince, Chiefe, or Head.</p>
               <p n="34">34. But now, giue me leaue, to ſay plainly, that it is
intollerable in you, to impugne by Reaſons, which you expreſſie only call
probabilityes, a matter delivered clearly in Scripture, teſtifyed by
Antiquity, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Nations, and corroborated by the great Plea of

Firſt, <hi>That S. Peter ſhould haue authority over all the Apoſtles, and
yet exerciſe no one act of Authority over any one of them, and that they
ſhould ſhew to him no ſigne of ſubjection, me thinks is as ſtrang, as
that a King of England for twenty fine yeares ſhould do no Act of Regality,
nor receiue any one acknowledgment of it:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="35">35. Anſwer 1. I would ask, how you can aſſure vs,
that S. Peter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed <hi>no one act of authority over any one of the</hi>
Apoſtles, vnless firſt you ſuppoſe, not only that all points of Faith,
but alſo all matters of fact, are regiſtred in Scripture, which I hope you
will not ſay, S. Luke in the Acts having ſet downe but a few things, and of
fewe? 2. If you belieue Scripture, you cannot doubt, but that in divers
occaſions, S. Peter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed Actions, declaring him to haue an ordinary
Charg, and Power proper to him. It was hee, who ſpoke firſt in the
Apoſtles Councell in Hieruſalem; who propoſed the Election of S.
Matthias; in warning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that in the writings of S. Paul, there were
things difficult to be vnderſtood, which in my opinyon deſerves to be
noted, declaring that the charg of the whole Church, was committed to him, even
in things relating to other Apoſtles; who is ſtill named in the firſt
place, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſuch manner, as the reſt are named as belonging to
him, or of his family, which appeares (Mark: 1. Luc: 8. &amp; 9. Act: 2. &amp;
5.) It was Hee who was wont to ſpeak for the reſt, and ſo S. Cyrill: vpon
thoſe words, Joan: 6. 
<q rend="margQuotes">Domine ad quem ibimus? ſaieth: Per

3. The Apoſtles being dead, or diſperſed, no wonder, if S. Peter, either
had no occaſion of exerciſing Iuriſdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, or at leaſt
there was not occaſion of writing it for poſterity. Beſides, all the
Apoſtles having juriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, over the whole world (which in them was
extraordinary, but ordinary in S. Peter) and being particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly aſſiſted
by the Holy Ghoſt for the due performance of their office, no wonder if S.
Peter had no occaſion of exerciſing his Power, in order to them, who wanted
neither Power, nor knowledg, nor will to correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond to the vocation of an
Apoſtle; which conſideration confutes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts your ſimilitude of a

regality over thoſe, who had as great Power as hee himſelf, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d who he was
aſſured, would make the beſt vſe of their Power, if we imagine any
ſuch caſe in a Kingdom, as de facto it was true in the Apoſtles, of whom
S. Cyprian ſaieth (De Vnitate Eccleſiae) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Loquitur Dominus ad Petrum: Ego tibi

Petrus, pari conſortio praediti &amp; honoris &amp; poteſtatis, ſed
exordium ab vnitate proficiſcitur. Primatus Petro da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, vt vna Chriſti
Eccleſia &amp; cathedra vna monſtretur.</q> Behold, how the Apoſtles had
juriſdiction over the whole world, though in a different manner, from that
according to which it was conferred vpon S. Peter, to deſcend to his
Succeſſours.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Secondly. You object, <hi>As ſtrang it is, that you
ſo many ages after ſhould know this ſo certainly, and that the Apoſtles
should be ſo ignorant that S. Peter was Head of the reſt, as to queſtion
which of them should be the greateſt, after that thoſe words were ſpoken
in their hearing by vertue wherof S. Peter is pretended to haue been made their
Head: yet more ſtrange that our Saviour should not bring them out of their
error, by telling them S. Peter was the man, but rather <pb n="873" facs="tcp:59214:452"/>confirme it by ſaying, the Kings of the Gentils exerciſe
authority over them, but it should not be ſo among them.</hi> Anſwer: It is
more ſtrange, that you ſhould make this objection, who teach that the
Apoſtles, even after the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Holy Ghoſt, having had an
expreſſe revelation, and comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d from our Saviour, were doubtfull, whether
they ought to preach to the Gentills. For if they might erre in Faith, and
practice, notwithſtanding ſo direct a revelation, and precept, how can you
wonder that before the receiving of the Holy Ghoſt, they might contend among
themſelves, which of them were the greater, although our Saviour had
promiſed to build his Church vpon S. Perer, (and why do you not ſay
againſt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it is ſtrang, that you ſo many ages after ſhould
know the Apoſtles did erre in that matter.) Beſides, Bellarmine de Romano
Pontifice (Lib: 1. cap: 28.) demonſtrates, both by teſtimonyes of Fathers,
and Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that S. Peter was not with the other Apoſtles, in that
contention of theirs, which of them was the greater, and ſo cannot be ſayd,
to haue been ignorant of his owne authority, which our Saviour had promiſed
(Matth: 16.) and actually conferred (Joan: 21.) Yea perhaps the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did
propoſe to themſelves, ſome temporall kinde of glory, or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as
the mother of S. James and S. John did, when ſhe petitioned our Saviour, that
one of her ſonnes might ſit at the right hand, the other at the left, in
his Kingdome, and did not thinke, of being Head of the ſpirituall Kingdome of
Chriſts Militant Church. According to which conſideration, it is no wonder,
<hi>If our Saviour should not bring them out of their errour, by telling them
S. Peter was the man</hi> (ſeing indeed he was no ſuch man, in order to a
temporall Kingdome) but rather confirmed it by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>the Kings of the
Gentils exerciſe authority over them, but it ſhould not be ſoe among
them.</hi> Which ſacred advice, had been alſo good, and neceſſary,
though their contention had been, about their preeminence in the Church, which
to ſeeke ambitiouſly, is evill, though the thing, to which they pretend, be
good. And ſeing our Saviour was afterward to commit the charge, of the whole
Church, to S. Peter in expreſſe termes, by a triple injunction of Paſce
oves meas, Feed my ſheep, (Joan: 21.) his divine wiſdome thought fit
(Matth: 18.) to giue them that holy advice of humility; it being time enough,
for them, to know, and reflect, that S. Peter was their Head, by that
expreſſe future declaration, of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (Joan: 21.)</p>
               <p n="38">38. Thirdly. You would proue that S. Peter was not Head
of the reſt, becauſe the Scripture ſayth, God hath appointed firſt
Apoſtles, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly <pb n="874" facs="tcp:59214:453"/>Prophets, but ſayth not, God
hath appointed Firſt Peter, then the reſt of the Apoſtles; which, to
ſpeake truth is a childiſh reaſon: it being cleare, that the Scripture,
in that place, doth not compare the Apoſtles among themſelves, but with
other degrees in the Church, as Prophets, Doctours &amp;c. Otherwiſe, you
might proue, that one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate can not be ſubordinate, and ſubject to
another, if one, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhould ſay, the commonwealth, conſiſts
of Magiſtrates, and people, becauſe forſooth, in that diviſion, you doe
not expreſſe the authority of one Magiſtrate, aboue another.</p>
               <p n="39">39 Fourthly; you ſay, S. Paul profeſſeth himſelf
<hi>to be nothing inferior to the very chiefest Apostles;</hi> and (if S. Peter
was Head of the Apoſtles) it was a wonder, that S. Paul ſhould ſo
<hi>farre forget S. Peter and himſelf, as that mentioning him often, he
should doe it without any title of Honour.</hi> But I beſeech you, can you
belieue, that S. Paul would ſay of himſelf, that he was <hi>not inferiour
to the chiefest of the Apostles,</hi> abſolutely, and in all things? He
accounted himſelf to be the firſt and chiefeſt amongſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and
laments, that he had bene a perſecutor of Chriſtians; and will you needs
vnderſtand him to ſay, that in ſuch reſpects, he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to
the other Apoſtles, who were innocent of thoſe things? He was an Apoſtle,
as the others were, and that is all, you can vnderſtand by his words; and all
that, makes juſt nothing to the purpoſe. But S. Paul mentions S. Peter
without any Title of honour. No more doth he giue any title to S. James, though
he were Biſhop of Hieruſalem, which ſurely deſerves ſome honour, if
the ſimplicity, of thoſe bleſſed tymes, had bene accuſtomed to
teſtify honour by titles. Yourſelf ſay heere, S. Peter <hi>might be head
of the Apoſtles, that is firſt in order, and honour among them, and not
haue ſupreme Authority over them;</hi> and Proteſtants eaſily grant that
he had that Priviledg of being firſt, in order, and honour; how then will
your anſwer your owne objection, that it was a wonder S. Paul ſhould
mention him, without any title of honour, ſeing particular honour was due to
him, even by our Saviours command? For, from what other cauſe could it
proceede? But ſhall I diſcloſe to you a myſtery, on which it ſeemes
you do not reflect? Our Saviour, whoſe words are operatiue, and deeds; by
calling S. Peter, Cephas, or a Rock, had alſo made him ſuch, and ſaied
Tues Petrus, Thou art a Rock, and vpon this Rock I will build my Church, ſo
that to name Peter, is to call him the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and head of the Church, and
all Chriſtians; and with what greater title of honour, could any body mention
any Creature? we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay, of S. Peter, as S. Ambroſe ſaieth,
of the title of Martyr (De <pb n="875" facs="tcp:59214:453"/>Uirginibus Lib. 1.) Quot
homines tot praecones, qui Martyrem praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant, dum loquuntnr. To name one a
martyr, is a title of honour; and ſo it is to name Peter, for the foreſaied
Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="40">40. You conclude; <hi>Though we ſhould grant againſt
all theſe probabilities, and many more</hi> (fooleries, ſay I, not
probabilities) <hi>that Optatus meant that S. Peter was head of the Apoſtles,
not in our, but your ſenſe, and that S. Peter indeed was ſo; yet ſtill
you are very farre from ſhewing, that in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Optatus, the
Biſhop of Rome was to be at all, much less by Divine Right, Succeſſor to
S. Peter in this his Headſhip and Authority. For what incongruity is there,
if we ſay, he might ſucceed S. Peter in that part of his care, the
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that particular Church, (as ſure he did even while S. Peter
was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) and yet that neither he nor any man was to ſucceed in his
Apoſtleſhip, nor in his government of the Church vniverſall? Eſpecially
ſeing S. Peter and the reſt of the Apoſtles, by laying the foundation of
the Church, were to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it, and accordingly are ſo called
in Scripture. And therefore as in abuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it is incongruous that foundation
ſhould ſucceed foundation: ſo it may be in the Church, that any other
Apoſtle should ſucceed the firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="41">41. Anſwer; If you ſuppoſe (as for the preſent
you doe) that S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by our Saviours inſtitution (and conſequently by
divine right) was Head of the Apoſtles; you ſhould not ſay, <hi>what
incongruity is there,</hi> but what incongruity is there not, <hi>if we
ſay,</hi> that the Biſhop of Rome, might <hi>ſucceed S. Peter, only in
the Government of that particular Church.</hi> For what can be more
incongruous, and fooliſh, than to imagine, that S. Peter was ordained by our
Saviour Head of the Apoſtles, and the whole Church, only for his life time,
when there was no need, and, as we may ſaie, litle vſe thereof, ſeing all
the Apoſtles had Juriſdiction over all Chriſtians, and Power to preach
the Goſpell, through the whole world; and ſo the neceſſity of ſuch
vniverſall Power in S. Peter, muſt haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to future Ages, after the
death of the Apoſtles; and if it muſt ſtill reſide in ſome, in whom
can you imagine it to be ſeated, except in him whom you deny not to be
Succeſſor of S. Peter for the Church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me? And that Optatus
ſuppoſed the vniverſall Power of S. Peter, to remaine in his
Succeſſors, appeares by his words, which I haue pondered aboue; as alſo
becauſe he ſpeakes of the Sea, or Chaire of Rome, as of the Rule, whereby
to judg of hereſies, and Schiſmes, not only for the tyme of S. Peter, but
for ever; and therefore he ſets downe a Catalogue of the Biſhops of Rome
only, and ſaith: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Cathedra vnica quae eſt prima de
dotibus, ſedit prior Petrus: cui ſucceſſit Linus, Lino ſucceſſit
Clemens, Clementi Anacletus &amp;c:</q> and ſo goes on till 
<pb n="876" facs="tcp:59214:454"/>his owne ayme. And I would gladly know, by what text of
Scripture you can proue that the Power of S. Peter over the whole Church, was
ſo particular, and perſonall, to him, that it ceaſed with his perſon?
Will you haue vs meaſure matters of Faith, with your congruities, or
incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities? With your Socinian, topicall, humane vaine, diſcourſes?
What meane you by theſe words <hi>as ſure he</hi> the Biſhop of Rome
<hi>did even while S: Peter was living?</hi> I will not examine heere, whether,
or in what manner Linus, and Cletus were Biſhops of Rome, before S. Peters
death (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be ſeene Baronius Anno 69. who ſaieth, they were not
Romanae ſedis epiſcopi, but only Coadjutores) I beſeech you remember,
what you ſaied (N. 98. and 99.) interpreting S. Cyprian and S. Optatus, that,
<hi>in one particular Church at once there ought to be but one Biſhop;</hi>
and certainly it is no conſequence, The Biſhop of Rome appointed by S.
Peter for Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and ſupplying his place, and depending on him, was not head
of the Church, while S. Peter did liue; therefore he could not be his
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, in that vniuerſall power, after S. Peters death. Neither do
you ſo much as offer to proue, that S. Peter ever relinquiſhed his being
the particular Biſhop of Rome, and therefore how can you ſay; the Biſhop
of Rome did ſucceed S. Peter, while he was living, ſeing no man can
ſucceed a Biſhop while that Biſhop lives, and is ſtill Biſhop of that
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, in which an other is pretended to ſucceed him?</p>
               <p n="42">42. Your Argument. (That, <hi>as in building it is
incongruous that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations should ſucceed foundations: ſo it may be in
the Church, that any other Apostle should ſucceed the first</hi>) is to giue
it the right name a nothing, or a meere equivocation in the Metaphor of a
foundation; whereas a Foundation in our caſe ſignifies a Head, or chiefe,
and if you hold it <hi>incongruous that foundations in this ſenſe should
ſucceed foundations,</hi> you muſt ſay, that no King, Prince, or
magiſtrate can without incongruity, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one an other. Beſides, The
Apoſtles were Foundations of the Church, by their Preaching, and Teaching
(for not all of them wrote, and they were foundations of the Church before any
one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrote) and I hope you will not ſay, it is incongruous, that
Preachers, and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſhould haue Succeſſors. Was not Judas an
Apoſtle, and was not S. Matthias choſen, not only after him, but
expreſſly for him, or in his place, or to ſucceede him? For ſo S. Peter
(Act: 1.) applies that place of Scripture, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Epiſcopatum ejus accipiat alter: and
the prayer of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s was, Oſtende quem elegeris ex his duobus vnum
accipere locum miniſterij hujus, &amp; Apoſtolatus, de quo praevaricatus
eſt Judas.</q> But <pb n="877" facs="tcp:59214:454"/>what, if your very ground, or
foundation (That <hi>in building it is incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that foundations should
ſucceed foundations</hi>) be falſe, as certainly it is? For, if you
ſuppoſe the firſt foundation to faile, or be taken away, may an other, be
ſubſtituted, and ſucceed it? The Apoſtles were Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but being
mortall, they faild, and needed ſucceſſours to ſupply their abſence,
and ſo your ſimilitude returnes directly vpon yourſelf. If you will
follow, the metaphor of a foundation, in all reſpects; how do you ſay;
<hi>S. Peter, and the rest of the Apostles, by laying the foundations of the
Church, were to be the foundations of it,</hi> ſeing you may ſaie, <hi>in
building it is incongruous</hi> that a foundation ſhould laie a foundation?
Will you haue it laie itſelf? Why do you not alſo ſay, that as the
foundation, is vnder the building; ſo the Apoſtles, and all Paſtors,
Prelats, and Superiours, are inferiour to the reſt of the Church? It ſeemes
though the Scripture ſhould be vnderſtood, (as indeed it ought) that
Chriſt intended, that S. Peters ſucceſſours ſhould haue
juriſdiction, over the whole Church, you will controll God himſelf, and
ſay, <hi>It is incongruous that foundation should ſucceed foundation.</hi>
You ſay els where, vntruly, that <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> trifles, about the word
foundation, which you confess to be metaphoricall, and ambiguous, and yet heere
you ground your whole Argument, vpon that metaphor, ill applied; as, (beſide
what hath bene ſayd) not only the Apoſtles, but Prophets alſo, are called
in Scripture foundations; 
<q rend="margQuotes">ſuper fundamentum Apoſtolorum,
&amp; Prophetarum;</q> and will you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, that in a building, it is
incongruous to haue more than one firme and perfect foundation, as certainly
the Apoſtles were? But I ſpend too much tyme in confuting ſuch toyes, as
theſe.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Your (N. 101.102.) haue bene anſwered already. The
Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts for the cauſe of their ſeparation prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, not only, that
<hi>the men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome they ſeparared, were defiled with the contagion of the
Traditors</hi> (as you ſay) but alſo that they erred in Faith, in believing
that Baptiſme, might be conferred by Heretiques; to omit other things. Your
calumnie about a picture hath beene confuted heretofore Your (N. 104.)
containes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, which may not be anſwered by former grounds.</p>
               <p n="44">44. To your (N. 105.) I anſwer, that ſeing Potter
accounts the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Roman Church to be damnable, to ſuch, as are not
excuſed by Ignorance, <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> had reaſon to ſay, the Doctour
condemnes all learned Catholiques, who leaſt of all men can plead Ignorance.
It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently true, that (as <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> P. 205.206) ſaith, theſe
two Propoſitions, cannot conſiſt in the vnderſtanding of any one, who
conſiders what he <pb n="878" facs="tcp:59214:455"/>ſaies: <hi>After due examination I
judg the Roman errours not to be in themſelves fundamentall, or damnable; and
yet I judg that according to true reaſon, it is damnable to hold them.</hi>
For, according to true reaſon, one is to judg of things, as indeed they are
in themſelves; and therefore, if in reaſon, I judg them not to be
fundamentall in themſelves, I muſt in reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, that they are
notfundamentall, being held by mee; neither doth there in this caſe intervene
any lye, ſeing one profeſſeth that not to be damnable, which he holds not
to be damnable. But where doth <hi>Ch. M.</hi> ſay, as you cite him;
<hi>Theſe Aſſertions, the Roman errours are in themſelves not damnable,
and yet it is damnable for me (who know them to be errours) to hold and confess
them, are abſolutely inconſistent?</hi> For it is impoſſible, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man can <hi>hold</hi> that which he knowes to be an errour; becauſe even by
knowing it to be an error, he holds it not, but diſſents from it. He
ſaieth only, that it cannot be damnable, to hold an error not damnable (which
is very true) but ſaieth not that one can hold an errour, which he knowes to
be an errour.</p>
               <p n="45">45. You make <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> ſpeak in this ridiculous
manner to Proteſtants; 
<q rend="margQuotes">If you erred in thinking that our
Church holds errours, this error or erroneous conſcience might be rectifyed
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d depoſed, by judging thoſe errors not damnable;</q> and then you
triumph, and ſpend many words in proving the very ſame thing, which <hi>Ch.
Ma.</hi> never denied, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly affirmed; namely, that the errours of the
Roman Church (vpon a fals ſuppoſition that ſhe had any) were not
damnable. Theſe be his words in the ſayed (N 206.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">If you grant your conſcience to be
erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, in judging that you cannot be ſaved in the Roman Church, by
reaſon of her errours, there is no other remedie, but that you muſt

not fundamentall. nor damnable. And this is no more charity, then you dayly
affoard to ſuch other Proteſtants, as you tearme breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, whome you
cannot deny to be in ſome errours (vnless you will hold that of
contradictorie propoſitions both may be true) and yet you doe not judge it
damnable to liue in their communion, becauſe you hold their errours not to be
fundamentall. Is this to ſay; If you erred in thinking that your Church holds
errours, this errour might be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by judging theſe errours not
damnable?</q> Is it not directly the contrary, and ſuppoſes errours, though
they be not damnable? Or doe you thinke, that Ch. Ma. holds Proteſtants not
to be in errour? All that Ch. Ma. ſayes, is, That if you erre, in judging you
cannot be ſaved, in <pb n="879" facs="tcp:59214:455"/>the Roman Church, by reaſon of
her errours, you muſt rectify your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by judging the errours, not
to be fundamentall, or damnable, and therfor not excluding ſalvation. Is this
good dealing in you? And why doe you ſay (N. 106.) <hi>A fifth falſhood it
is that we daily doe this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for Proteſtants, you muſt meane (if you
ſpeake conſequently) to judge they haue no errours, becauſe we judge they
haue none damnable?</hi> Seing Ch: Ma: ſayd moſt expreſly, that you doe
the favour to other <hi>Protestants, whome you cannot deny to be in ſome
errours, not to judge it damnable to liue in their communion, becauſe you
hold their errours not to be fundamentall.</hi> Once againe I muſt aske,
whether this be conſcionable dealing?</p>
               <p n="46">46. You are too reſolute, in this (N. 106.) to impugne
the ſaying of Ch: Ma: <hi>That according to the Doctrine of all Divines, ther
is great difference betwixt a ſpeculatiue perſwaſion; and a practicall
dictamen of conſcience.</hi> And I feare, you doe not well vnderſtand, this
true Doctrine, when you ſay; <hi>Theſe are but divers words ſignifying
the ſame thing; neither is ſuch a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wholy ſpeculatiue, but
tending to practiſe: nor ſuch a dictamen wholy prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, but grounded
vpon ſpeculation.</hi> For, you ſhould ſay the contrary, that a
perſwaſion purely ſpeculatiue, is ſo far from tending to practice, that
oftentimes, it is joyned with this judgment; I cannot frame my practice,
according to this ſpeculation; and conſequently my practice, can not be
grounded vpon ſuch a ſpeculation, as Catholike Divines doe learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
explicate, particularly, in the matter and forme of Sacraments. But this is not
a place, to handle this matter at large; it being ſufficient to haue ſayd,
that a ſpeculation, taken alone, and abſtracting from all other
conſiderations, of all ſides, oftentimes would proue pernicious, if it were
applyed to practice. You falſify Ch: Ma: as if he did affirme, that
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants <hi>did only conceaue in ſpeculation, that the Church of Rome
erred in ſome Doctrines, and had not alſo a practicall dictamen, that it
was damnable for them to continue in the profeſsion of theſe errours.</hi>
For, Ch: Ma: ſayth not, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants did only conceaue in
ſpeculation &amp;c.? And had not alſo a practicall dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men &amp;c.</hi>
but his words are: <hi>Although they had in ſpeculation conceaved, the
viſsble Church to erre in ſome Doctrines of themſelves not damnable; yet
with that ſpeculatiue judgment, they might, and ought, to haue entertained
this practicall dictamen, that for points not ſuhſtantiall to Faith, they
neither were bound, nor lawfully could, breake the bond of Charity, by breaking
vnity in Gods Church.</hi> You ſee Ch: Ma: declares not, what dictamen
Proteſtants had, but what they might, and ought, to haue had, which are as
different things, as to ſay, one is an honeſt man, and might, and ought to
be ſuch an one. <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59214:456"/>Ch: Ma: ſayes not, that Dr. Potter
teaches, in express words, that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was obliged to forſake the Church,
for an vnneceſſary light, but that it followes, vpon his aſſertion that
he was bound to forſake her externall communion, for poinrs not neceſſary
to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="47">47. In your (N. 107.) your example, that <hi>Euclide was
not infallible, yet was he certaine enough, that twice two are foure,</hi> is
not to the purpos, becauſe ſuch truths, are evident by the light of nature,
as the myſteries of Chriſtian Faith are not. Otherwiſe how were it
poſſible for you to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree, ſo irreconciliably, as the world ſees,
you doe?</p>
               <p n="48">48. Ch: Ma: ſayth (N. 41.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Since in caſes of vncertaintyes we

to ſatisfy their zealous conſcience, without a publick breach:
eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if with their vncertainty, we call to minde the peaceable
poſſeſſion, and preſcription, which by the confeſſion of your
owne brethren, the Church, and Pope of Rome did for many ages enjoy.</q> To
this you anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, by abbreviating the words of Ch: Ma: thus; <hi>Your Church
was in pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable poſſeſsion (you muſt meane of her Doctrine and the

you add: <hi>Doctrine is not a thing that may be poſſeſſed: and the

her Doctrine and the Profeſſors of it)</hi> as if his words muſt needs be
ſo reſtrained? Wheras the Church of Rome was in poſſeſſion of
Right, not to bee oppoſed in her Doctrine by private perſons; ſhe was in
poſſeſſion, of the good Name, and Eſtimation, of being a true Church,
for which ſhe is commended by S. Paul; The Pope was in poſſeſſion, of
power, and juriſdiction, over all Chriſtians; of making lawes, Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
appeales gathering Councells &amp;c. And both the Pope, and Church, were in
poſſeſſion, of the Profeſſors of her Doctrine, that is,
Chriſtians were their ſubjects, who could not be ſeduced by fraude,

which conſiſtes in forſaking the externall Communion of Catholicks with
whome ſuch men pretend to agree, in beliefe. Beſides, perhaps they are not
Catholiks ſo far, as to belieue, they are obliged to forſake the externall
communion of Proteſtants, and returne to vs; which if they belieue not, they
are not Catholicks, in all points even of Faith, which teacheth vs, that it is
Schiſmaticall, and damnable to be divided, from the externall Communion of
the true Church: and I pray God this kind of men would reflect on this your

theſe words: <hi>Almighty God having ordained Man, to a ſupernaturall End,
of Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, by ſupernaturall meanes, it was requiſite, that his
vnderſtanding ſhould be enabled to apprehend that End and meanes, by a
ſupernaturall knowledg. This</hi> ſaying you approue (N. 2.) if <hi>Ch. Ma.
mean by knowledg, an apprehenſion, or belief. But if he take the word
properly and exactly, Faith is not knowledg, no more then three is foure, but
eminently contained in it, ſo that he that knowes, believes, and ſomething
more, but he that believes many times does not know, nay if he doth barely, and
meerely belieue, he doth never know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Anſwer; accordingly to the right method, and order of
doctrine, <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> takes knowledg in generall, as an act of the
vnderſtanding, or Congnoſcitiue, and knowing Power of our ſoule, which
muſt be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, as it is diſtinguiſhed from an act of the Will; and
ſo in that Axiom of Phyloſophers, and Divines, Nihil volitnm, quod non
cognitum, nothing is willed or deſired, which is not knowne, knowledg is
taken in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, for an act of the vnderſtanding, or cognoſcitiue Power
without diſtinguiſhing betweene acts: evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, obſcure, probable containe
diſtinct, or confuſed. And if this be a true, and proper acception, of
knowledg, taken in generall, certainly in the ſame ſenſe, it muſt be
true in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſpecies of knowledge, as all genericall natures, are
properly, found in every ſpecies, and ſo we ſay, of knowledg, ſome is
evident, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me obſcure &amp;c, and I would gladly know; what other genus;
you would find, to thoſe, and other particular ſpecies. It was therfore
neceſſary for <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> while he ſpoke in generall, and
abſtracted from evident, or <pb n="885" facs="tcp:59214:458"/>obſcure aſſents, to
ſpeak as he did: but then deſcending to particular ſpecies, he
diſtinguiſhes faith, which muſt be obſcure, from evident knowledg, but
not abſolutely from knowledg; and therfore you cite him amiss, when you
affirme, that <hi>He requires that the object of Faith muſt be both naturally
and ſupernaturally vnknowne,</hi> whereas he ſaieth, it ſhould be
<hi>voide even of ſupernaturall evidence</hi> (which is not all one as to
ſay, it muſt be voyde of ſupernaturall knowledg) and when he ſaied, our
aſſent to divine truths muſt be <hi>vnknowing</hi> (for ſo it ſhould
haue bene written, and not <hi>vnknowen,</hi> which belongs to the object, not
to the act of aſſent) he explicated it, or inevident by humane
diſcourſe. So that heere is no retractation, of what he ſayd of knowledg
in generall; but wheras you would proue a retractation by his words, <hi>Faith
differs from ſcience in regard of the objects obſcurity,</hi> though I find
not theſe formall words in <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi> yet I muſt ſay they proue not
your purpoſe. For knowledg, being a Genus to Science, it doth not follow,
Faith differs from Science, therefore it differs from, (or is not) knowledg;
but contrarily, ſcience being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, it cannot be diſtinguiſhed from
Faith by knowledg taken in generall (ſeing Faith is alſo a knowledg

ſhew too much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (ſome would ſay ignotance) in ſaying ſo
reſolutely as you doe, to <hi>Ch. Ma. That ſcience and knowledg properly

ſcience, taken properly and ſtrictly, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfore they cannot be
ſynonimous termes. Nay, though knowledg were taken for one ſpecies of
knowledg, not as it is genus to different ſpecies, but as it is determined to
ſignifie an evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t knowledg, yet it is not Synonimous with ſcience taken

                  </gap>, for knowledg produced by
demonſtration, but it is of a larger compass, and comprehends all evident
aſſents, and among the reſt, the moſt generall Principles of nature, as
alſo the immediate Principles and premiſſes of ſcience itſelf. I
meane of a demonſtratiue concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As, for the ſignification of the
word, knowledg, in our Engliſh phraſe, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the circumſtances,
in which it is vſed, whether, or no, it be, <pb n="886" facs="tcp:59214:459"/>termined to
an evident knowledg, or may alſo ſignify any aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, though it be
obſcure. If one ſhould ſay, I know no ſuch man as Jeſus Chriſt, not
any ſuch thing as Chriſtian Religion, would you approue his ſaying, by
your ſpeculation, that he knowes nothing of Chriſt, or Chriſtianity,
becauſe he believes it, and belief or Faith is not knowledg, as you ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ak?
But if an other, to ſhew the fervour of his Faith, ſhould ſay, I doe
rather know, than belieue, the truth of Chriſtian Religion, he would be
vnderſtood to take knowledg for an evident aſſent, diſtinct from Faith
which is obſcure. If you conſult holy Scripture you will find S. Paul to
ſay (2. Tim. 1.12.) ſcio cui credidi, I know whom I haue believed, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
your Proteſtant Engliſh Translation hath it. And (1. Cor. 13.12.) videmus
nunc per ſpeculum in aenigmate; your Engliſh Translation hath; Now we ſee
through a glaſſe; And yet ſeeing ſeemes more to ſignify e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and to be oppoſite to believing, then only knowing. And (Joan: 14.9.) the
Engliſh Proteſtants Bible hath: haue I bene ſo long with you, and yet
haſt thou not knowne me, Philip: and Beza in Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, Non cognoviſti me?
And, (Job. 19.25.) your Engliſh Bible alſo hath; I know that my redeemer
liveth. Innumerable other Texts, may be ſeene, in the Concordance of the
bible, to this purpoſe, wherein know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is applyed to objects of Faith. And
S. Auſtine, (Lib. 1. de Doctr. Chriſt.) ſaieth: non verendum dicere, nos
ſcire, quae idoneis teſtibus novimus. But I may juſtly be thought to haue
ſaid too much, in this Queſtion, which may ſeeme, de nomine, if your
preſumptuous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere dealing had not forced me, and if I had not
taken occaſion, to explicate ſome other points, by occaſion of the word
(knowledg) from which I now pass to the Matter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You affirme, the ſaying of Ch. Ma. to be good, if he
meane by knowledg, apprehenſion, or belief; wherein you are greatly
miſtaken, if you take apprehenſion particularly and ſtrictly as it is a
ſpecies, and the firſt operation of the vnderſtanding, diſtinct from
the ſecond, which is Judgment, or affirmation, or negation, and the third
which is diſcourſe; For, Faith is an aſſent or Judgment, that a thing
is, or is not, which apprehenſion, is not, nay (to vſe your owne
expreſſion) if he doth barely and meerely apprehend, he doth never affirme,
or deny; and in our caſe one may apprehend an object revealed, without
Judging it to be true, or fals. A learned Heretique, or infidell, may apprehend
the objects of our Faith, better than ſome true believer; but the difference
is in the act of judging, or aſſenting, which the one does; the other does
not. If you <pb n="887" facs="tcp:59214:459"/>take apprehenſion in generall, as it
abſtracts from, and is common to the three particular ſpecies, or acts of
the vnderſtanding, apprehenſion, judgment, and diſcourſe, as <hi>Ch.
Ma.</hi> does, when he ſayes mans <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding muſt be enabled to
apprehend that End, and Meanes by a ſupernaturall knowledg,</hi> you do not
diſtinguiſh it, from knowledg in generall, or as it is common to all the
particular ſpecies of acts in the vnderſtanding, evident, obſcure;
certaine, probable, &amp;c. and then you fall into that very thing, which you
object againſt your adverſary, that Faith is knowledg, taking knowledg, in
generall, as I explicated aboue. Yet all this, is nothing to the Philoſophy,
which you deliver in theſe words. <hi>Faith is not knowledg, no more then
three is foure, but eminently contained in it.</hi> But if you conſider well,
you will find, that three taken materially is contained formally in foure, or
if you take them, as they are diſtinct ſpecies, the one is not contained in
the other, but are indiviſibly diſtinct in nature, and eſſence, and
excluſiue one of another: and therfore your inference <hi>ſo that, he that
knowes, believes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſomething more, but he that believes many times does
not know</hi> cannot be good, taking knowledg (as you doe, and vpon which
acception you ground your objection) for an evident knowledg, as if an evident
aſſent did neceſſarily and vniverſally include belief, that is an
obſcure, or inevident aſſent, either formally, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it doth
not, or eminently, ſeing an humane naturall knowledg, though it be evident,
is not more perfect than an inevident, certaine, and ſupernaturall act of
divine Faith: and yourſelf pretend, that you are ready to renounce, all
evidence of whatſoever human reaſon, in compariſon of any truth revealed
in Scripture You ſay, a knowledg of a thing abſolutely vnknownen, is a
plain implicancy, but you ſay ſo to no purpoſe, ſince Ch. Ma. never
ſaied, that Faith is knowledg, as knowledg is taken for any particular
ſpecies of knowledg which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. But in the meane time looke, how you
can reconcile your owne words, <hi>he that knowes believes, and ſomething
more,</hi> whereof I haue ſpoken already. Finally; Faith muſt be an evident
knowledg, in your opinion, who hold it to be an evident concluſion, clearly
deduced from evident premiſſes, and ſo you impugne yourſelf, not your
adverſary. Your (N. 3.4.5.) haue bene anſwered already. Only I obſerue
that, Hooker cited in your margent, for any thing that can be gathered by his
words, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands no more, than that Faith is not ſo abſolutely certain
as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, ſpeaking of certainty joynd with evidence wherein all men
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but agree; whereas the certainty, of Faith, is of a different kind of 
<pb n="888" facs="tcp:59214:460"/>certainty derived from the Diviue Teſtimony, and
ſpeciall motion of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſuch as doth not neceſſitate
vs to an aſſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it implies obſcurity; which makes nothing for
your purpoſe, who teach that Faith hath no abſolute certainty, either
evident, or obſcure.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In anſwer to your (N. 6.) you know, C. Ma: never
reſolves Faith into Tradition, in your ſenſe, as it ſignifies meere
humane teſtimony, but teaches, that the infallible Propoſer of Divine
Uerityes, is the Church of every age; and other arguments of credibility are,
of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, only preparations, and diſpoſitions, to an act of Faith;
but the Church we belieue to be infallible, by the ſame meanes, whereby the
Apoſtles proved themſelves to be infallible, as I ſhewed (Chap 5.) Thus
the firſt contradiction, which you impute to C. Ma. is of no force; as
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſecond, which goes vpon a very fals, and injurious aſſertion
that <hi>Charit: Ma: profeſſes to haue no aſſurance, but that
Proteſtants dying Proteſtants may poſſibly die with Contrition, and be
ſaved,</hi> whereof I treated (Chap: 8.)</p>
               <p n="6">6. Your (N. 7.) gives vs a ſtrang kind of Philoſophy,
while you ſay, That <hi>obſcure and evident are affections not of our
aſſent, but of the object of it, not of our belief, but of the thing
believed;</hi> whereas the direct contrary is true. For, objects, or things in
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, are neither evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor obſcure, but by acts of ours, and from
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, receyue an extrinſecall denomination, of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, obſcure, certaine,
or probable: Otherwiſe the ſame object ſhould be, in itſelf, at the
ſame tyme, obſcure, evident, certaine, probable, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, confuſed,
diſtinct, perfect, imperfect, as at the ſame tyme, it may chance to
terminate, different kinds of acts: and even God, who is infinite Light,
ſhould be obſcure, yea imperfect, becauſe in this life we can know him
only ex parte, and imperfectly. Yourſelf in this very next (N. 8.) ſay;
<hi>We cannot be infallibly certain of the Truth of the things which we
belieue, vnless our evidence of it were of the higheſt degree;</hi> where you
declare, that evidence, is ours, and not inherent in the objects, as green or
blew are, and therefore our ſight is not green or blew (as you (N. 7.) infer
it muſt be, if our aſſent itſelf could be called obſcure) and yet it
is more abfurd, to ſay, our ſight is greene, ther that the object v.g. God
himſelf, is obſcure, probable, vncertaine, confuſed, imperfect, becauſe
he may be knowne by ſuch different acts. And this your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is retorted
againſt yourſelf. For as the ſame object, without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in
itſelf, may beſeene clearly, and dimly by different acts of 
<pb n="889" facs="tcp:59214:460"/>our Eye, which makes it cleare that the more or less
cleareness is in the act of ſeeing, not in the thing ſeene; ſo we muſt
ſay of our vnderſtanding, which is the Eye of our ſoule, that evidence,
probability &amp;c. are in the Acts of that Eye, and not in the objects which
are vnderſtood. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeares, that you had no reaſon to pleaſe
yourſelf ſo much in this ignorance of yours as to vpbraied Ch. Ma. and
ſaye: 
<q rend="margQuotes">In other places I anſwer your words,

noted aboue, which you cite out of Ch. Ma. ſhould haue bene put to the
Errata, and corrected <hi>vnknowing,</hi> as it appeares by the word with which
he joynes it, and by which he declares it, ſaying (or inevident) and by the
words which follow, that Faith abſolutely ſhould be obſcure in itſelf.
The reſt of this Number hath bene anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at larg heretofore, neither is
there any particular difficulty in your (N. 8.)</p>

Queſtionleſſe you were miſtaken.</hi> Anſwer; C. Ma. ſayes not that
Prudence is eſſentiall to Faith, and parte of the definition of it nor in
the definition which he gives (N. 8.) prudence is ſo much as mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Yet
for the thing itſelfe, ſeing I haue proved in the Introduction, that Faith
is ſupernaturall in eſſence, and cannot be produced, but by the
ſpeciall grace of the holy Ghoſt (whatſoever you may thinke to the
contrary) and that the Holy Ghoſt cannot moue to an action, all things
conſidered, imprudent; it followes, that an act of Faith, cannot be
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, as it is impoſſible it ſhould be ſupernaturall in
eſſence, and not involue an order, or reference, to a ſupernaturall
cauſe. Now your ſelfe here (N. 9.) confeſſe, that without credible
reaſons, and <hi>inducements, our choice even of the true Faith, is not to be
comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded as prudent, but to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of raſhness and levity.</hi> I
ſay, an act of Faith muſt alwayes be prudent, not that every one, muſt be
able to giue to others an account of his faith, as you interpret the matter,
but that the capacity of the believer, and all other circumſtances,
conſidered, the beliefe of ſuch a man, is indeed prudent. I wonder what
could moue you (N. 10.) to ſay to <hi>Charity Maintayned; It is againſt
Truth and Charity to ſay as you doe that they: with cannot doe ſoe</hi>
(that is cannot giue a Reaſon and account of their Faith) <hi>either are not
at all, or to no purpos true believers:</hi> whereas <hi>Charity Maintayned
hath no</hi> ſuch matter.</p>
               <pb n="890" facs="tcp:59214:461"/>
               <p n="8">8. In your (N. 11.12.) you ſay <hi>It is not Hereſy to
oppoſe au Truth propoſed by the Church, but only ſuch a Truth, as is an
eſſentiall part of the Goſpell of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Anſwer: you haue no conſtancie in your doctrine.
Here you ſay, Hereſy cannot be without errour againſt ſome

againſt any Doctrine revealed by God, is not a damnable Hereſy, vnless it

By eſſentiall, I ſuppoſe you meane <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> and

doctrine, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places you teach, that whatſoever is oppoſit to
Scripture, is an Hereſy; as (Pag: 101. N. 127.) you ſay; <hi>If Scripture
be ſufficient to informe vs what is the Faith, it muſt of neceſsity be
alſo ſufficient to teach vs what is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy; ſeing Hereſy is nothing
but a manifeſt deviation from and oppoſition to the Faith.</hi> But you
will not deny, that every text of Scripture is ſufficient to make a thing a
matter of faith; therfore you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny, but that errour againſt any ſuch
text, being a deviation from, and an oppoſition to Faith, muſt
neceſſarily be hereſy: which is more cleare in your groundes, who teach,
that it is impoſſible, to know what points in Scripture be funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
and conſequently what is Hereſy, if you take it for a deviation, only from
fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall points. And this you declare clearly in the ſame Number, (Pag:
102.) Saying: <hi>If any man ſhould obſtinatly contradic<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the truth of any
thing plainely delivered in Scripture, who doth not ſee, that every one who
believes the Scripture, hath a ſufficient meanes to diſcover, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, and avoyd that Hereſy, without any need of an infallible
guide?</hi> You teach alſo, that, as things are ordered, there is equall
neceſſity of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things contained in Scripture, whether they be
Fundamentall, or not Fundamentall: and nothing is more frequent in your Booke,
than that it is a damnable ſinne, to disbelieue any one truth, ſufficiently
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be revealed by God, and what ſinne can it be but the ſinne
of Hereſy, which is oppoſit to the Theologicall vertue of Faith? Potter
alſo, ſpeakes clearly to this purpoſe, ſaying (Pag: 98.) <hi>He is

propounded,</hi> and yet it is cleare, that in Scripture there are millions of
truths, not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. And (Pag: 128.) <hi>An obstinate ſtanding out
againſt evident Scripture cleared vnto him makes an Heretick:</hi> And (Pag:

a ſufficient propoſition to proue him th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t gaineſayeth any ſuch truth, to be an

true, whatſoever is revealed in Scripture <pb n="891" facs="tcp:59214:461"/>or propounded
by the Church out of Scripture, is in ſome ſenſe Fundamentall, in regard
of the Diuine Authority of God and his word, by which it is recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: that
is, ſuch, as may not be denyed or contradicted without in fidelity: Such as
every Chriſtian is bound with humility, and reverence to belieue whenſoever
the knowledge therof is offered to him.</hi> And further (Pag: 250.) <hi>Where
the revealed will or word of God is ſufficiently propounded; there he that
oppoſeth is convinced of errour, and he who is thus convinced, is an
Heretique, and Hereſy is a worke of the fleſh, which excludeth from
heaven</hi> (Gal: 5.20.21.) <hi>And hence it followeth, that it is Fundament
all to a Chriſtians Faith, and neceſſary for his ſalvation, that he
belieue all revealed truths of God, whereof he may be convinced that they are
of God.</hi> And (Pag: 57.) <hi>Whoſoever either wilfully oppoſes any

<hi>Freedom from Fundamentall errour, may be found among Heretiks;</hi>
Therefore errour, againſt points not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntall is Hereſy, ſeing they

au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then that of the Parliament? But no wonder, if Hereſies be
fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and ripe among you, if they conſiſt only in fundamentall errours,
and that, you are not able to determine, what errours be fundamentall, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
who will be carefull to avoyd they know not what: For the reſt of this
number, I need only ſay, that it is vnreaſonable in you to deſire a
proofe, of that which here you expreſly grant to be true, and is cleare of
itſelfe; that either the Proteſtant, or Roman Church, muſt erre
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the word, and teſtimony of God, ſeing they hold contradictories,
in matters belonging to faith; and it is a fond thing in you to ſay, that Ch:
Ma: hath for his reaſon, their contradiction only, ſeing we alwayes
ſpeake of contradiction in matter of Faith. Your (N. 13.) containes no
difficulty, ſuppoſing we haue already proved, the infallibility of the
Church, as we haue done in divers places.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To your (N. 14.) I anſwer; that if Luther were an
Heretick, who can deny, but that they who followed, and perſiſt in the
ſame Doctrine, muſt alſo be ſuch; ſeing it is a foolery, to thinke,
that all of them can be excuſed by ignorance? Beſides we ſpeake, per ſe

                  </gap>acting from ignorance, &amp;c. And ſo your <pb n="892" facs="tcp:59214:462"/>diſtinction, out of S. Auſtin, of Haeretici, and Heraeticorum
ſequace is not pertinent; neither did Charity Maintayned ever affirme, that
alls Arians, who followed their teachers, were excuſed from formall Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
by Salvianus, and I am ſure, Ch: Ma: himſelfe is far from any ſuch
opinion; yea even Dr. Potter, who (Pag: 119.) alleadgeth the words of
Salvianus, ſayth he ſpeakes of ſome Arian Hereticks; from whence it doth
not follow, that he ſpoke of all thoſe, who followed their teachers; and
thoſe of whome he ſpoke, he doth not abſolutly excuſe, but ſayes,
<hi>How they ſhall be puniſhed in the laſt day of judgment, for this
errour of their falſe opinion, none but the judge himſelfe can know:</hi> 
                  <q rend="margQuotes">Qualiter pro hoc ipſo falſae

Judex,</q> as Potter cites him in the margent: Which wordes if one take in
rigour, ſuppoſe, they are to be puniſhed, and that they haue ſinned,
but that none can tell how, or how far, or how much, their ignorance might
leſſen their puniſhment. Your ſaying to Ch: Ma: <hi>You yourſelfe
though you pronounce the leaders among the Artans formall Hereticks</hi> (which
words you put in a different letter as if they were his words, though I finde
them not in him) <hi>yet confeſſe that Salvian was at leaſt
doubtfull</hi> (that at leaſt is your owne word) <hi>whether theſe Arians
who in ſimplicity followed their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, might not be excuſed by
ignorance. And about this ſuſpenſion of his you alſo ſeeme
ſuſpended, for you neither approue nor condemne it.</hi> Thus you, not
without ſome tincture of your Gall. For Ch: Ma: being only to declare
Salvians minde, had neither reaſon, nor occaſion, to declare, in this
place, his owne opinion, how far ignorance, may excuſe ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
perſons, which he did (Part: 1. Cap: 1. N. 3. and 5. and Part 2. Pag: 102.)
in the Concluſion of his Booke, where you will finde, but very cold comfort,
for ſuch as hope to be ſaved by ignorance.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That which followes, is more againſt Potter, then
againſt Ch: Ma:, who grounds his argument, vpon the expreſſe words of the
Doctor, That to confine the Church to one part, and place, as the Donatiſts
did to Africa, was an errour, <hi>In the matter and nature of it properly
Hereticall, againſt that Article of the Creed, wherein we profeſſe to
belieue the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</hi> To which Major propoſition he adds
this Minor. But Luthers Reformation, or Church (if one man may be cald a
Church) was not vniverſall, but confined, to that place, which contained
Luthers body; (a leſſe compas then Africa.) Therefore his Reformation, or
doctrine can not be excuſed from formall Hereſy. This Deduction to me
ſeemes no leſſe then demonſtratiue, ſuppoſing the express grant of
Dr. Potter for <pb n="893" facs="tcp:59214:462"/>the Major propoſition, and yet you are
pleaſed to call it a rope of Sand, and an vnſyllogiſticall
ſyllogiſme, and ſay it <hi>is even coſen German to this; To deny the
Reſurrection is properly an hereſy; but the preaching of the Ghoſpell at
the beginning was not vniverſall; Therfore it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nnot be excuſed from
formall hereſy. For as he whoſe Reformation is but particular may yet not
deny the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſo may he alſo not deny the Churches
vniverſality; and as the Apoſtles who preached the Ghoſpell in the
beginning did belieue the Church vniverſall, though their preaching at the
beginning was not ſo; ſo Luther alſo might, and did belieue the Church
vniverſall, though his Reformation were but particular.</hi> But good Syr,
how then do you defend your client, the Doctour from this your argument? To
ſay, the viſible Church is confined to one place, is properly an hereſy,
as Potter affirmes it to be; But the preaching of the Ghoſpell at the
beginning was but in one place, therfore it was formall Hereſy. As alſo
from your other: <hi>To deny the Reſurrection is properly an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy
&amp;c.</hi> Be pleaſed then, to doe your Doctor the favour, to reflect, That
conſidering the Predictions of the Prophets, of the Amplitude, Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Promiſe of our Saviour, for the ſtability of his Church, to ſay, that
after ſixteene hundred yeares, it was reduced, not only to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
which contained Luthers body, but that it was corrupted, with many, and
damnable errours, that is, in true Divinity, to a No-Church; yea, and that many
chiefe Proteſtants expreſly affirme, that it wholy periſhed, is a vaſt
Hereſy; vnles you would rather call it, by the name of infidelity; the
conſideration wherof, did bring ſome chiefe learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to
renounce Chriſtian Religion. And ſo your argument, dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen from the firſt
preaching of the Apoſtles, is of no force, and coſen German to this: To
deny, that divers Churches, and Nations did rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aue the Faith of Chriſt (as
S. Paul teſtifieth of the Church of Rome in particular) is properly an
Hereſy, againſt the expreſſe wordes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but at the very
firſt preaching of the Apoſtles, Rome, and many other places, did not
receaue the Faith of Chriſt, but only ſome of thoſe who heard their
firſt Sermons, Therefore their firſt preaching was Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. And for you
to ſay, that the Church is only vniverſall de jure, becauſe it ought to
be ſo, is no leſſe ridiculous, then impious, againſt the promiſe of
our Saviour, which was that ſhe was de facto to be vniverſall, and not,
that ſhe ought to be vniverſall, and perpetuall, as every man ought to be
vertuous, and as the Donatiſts did not deny ſhe ought to be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall,
as Ch. Ma. ſhewes (N. 17. Pag. 242.) of which Number you take notice, for
ſome other matter, but diſſemble this point, which yourſelfe 
<pb n="894" facs="tcp:59214:463"/>alſo affirme (Pag: 300. N. 99.) in theſe words:
<hi>The Truth is the Donatists had ſet vp at Rome a Biſhop of their
faction: not with intent to make him Biſhop of the whole Church, but of that
Church in particular.</hi> And although in this you be much deceaved, becauſe
the intention of the Donatiſts, was not that which you faine, for your owne
purpoſe, but vnder pretence to take care of their Brethren in that Citty,
though indeed that the world might account them Catholiks, by communicating
with the Biſhop of Rome, with whom to communicate, was taken by the Ancient
Fathers, for an aſſured ſigne of being a true Catholik. They had alſo,
as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin (de vnitate Eccleſiae C. 3.) witneſſeth, a pretended
Church, in the houſe and territory of a Spaniſh Lady, called Lucilla. And
the ſame Saint ſpeaking of the conference, he had with Fortunius the
Donatiſt, ſayth (Epiſt. 163.) <hi>Here did he firſt attempt to affirme,
that his communion was ſpread over the whole earth &amp;c. But becauſe the
thing was evidently falſe, they got out of this diſcourſe by confuſion
of Language:</hi> Whereby nevertheleſſe they ſufficiently declared, that
they did not hold, that the true Church ought neceſſarily to be confined,
to one place, but only by meere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, were forced to yield, that it
was ſo in fact, becauſe their Sect, which they held to be the only true
Church, was not ſpead over the whole world. In which point Fortunius, and the
reſt, were more modeſt than he who ſhould affirme, that Luthers
reformation, in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, was ſpread over the whole earth, being
at that time, by many degrees, not ſo far diffuſed, as the Sect of the
Donatiſts. This is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Ch. Ma. in the ſayd (N. 17.)
whereof you thought ſafeſt, to take no notice, as indeed deſtructiue of
your argument. As for your objection, that the greater part of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is not Chriſtian, &amp;c. every Chriſtian, and in particular, Dr. Potter
muſt anſwer it; ſeing all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians read in the Holy Scripture, 
<q rend="margQuotes">in omnem terram exivit Sonus
eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</q> which is to be performed, not in an inſtant, but in due time, as
the Prophets and Apoſtles did avouch it ſhould, and, which is moſt for
our preſent purpoſe, none muſt deny, but that it is impoſſible for
her to faile from all places, which is more then even the Donatiſts taught,
who pretended, that ſhe remained at leaſt in Africa. Now, as for your
Syllogiſmes, make them like to that of Ch. Ma., and they will not be like a
rope of ſand, or vnſyllogiſticall, but will appeare in this manner: To
deny the Reſurrection is to teach an Hereſy, but ſome haue denied the
Reſurrection; Therefore ſome haue taught an hereſy, as Ch. Ma. ſayd; To
deny the Church to be de facto vniverſall, for all times, is to teach 
<pb n="895" facs="tcp:59214:463"/>Ann: hereſy, as even Dr. Potter affirmes but Luther at
his firſt being when he ſayd of himſelfe, Primò ſolus eram,
denyed the Church to be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall; Therfor he taught an hereſy. But
enough of this, wherof I haue more heretofore. Your bold ſpeech againſt S.
Auſtine, that he was moſt palpably miſtaken, I omit, as being but
agreable to your Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Spirit.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Your (N. 15.) requires no other anſwer, except a
deſire, that the Reader will peruſe the (N. 17.) of Ch. Ma., which you
pretend to anſwer, but leaue out points deſerving particular
conſideration, for the matter of which we ſpoke in the laſt Number. You
ſay to Ch. Ma. that he proſecutes the ſimilitude of Proteſtants with
the Donatiſts: <hi>with as much ſpight and malice as could be
deviſed;</hi> But, by your leaue, who is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the Donatiſts,
hated the name of a monaſticall life; conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Religious Nunnes to
forſake theyr Profeſſion; caſt the Euchariſt to Beaſts;
demoliſhed Altars; perſecuted Catholiques, in all kinds, and detracted from
their good name, accuſing them for Traditors, (you know who haue murthered
innocent, holy, learned Catholiques, vnder a moſt falſe pretence of
Treaſon) as alſo that the Donatiſts appealed from Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall,
to ſecular Judges, in ſpirituall cauſes? And do not Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants follow
them in theſe things? Which yet Ch: Ma: did not mention. Your Number 16.
about the accuſation of Donatiſts, that Catholiks ſet vp pictures vpon
the Altar, hath been anſwered at large, heretofore.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Your (N. 17.) objects to Ch: Ma: a contradiction, as
if he ſayd, the Donatiſts held the Church to haue periſhed, and yet that
the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are worſe then Donatiſts, who ſayd that the Church
remained at leaſt in Africa. But certainely no Logick will teach, that it is
a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, to ſay according to Donatiſts the Church through the
whole world periſhed, except in thoſe who were in their communion, or in
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, and yet remained in Africa, yea the firſt part infers the ſecond,
that their Church remained in Africa. And you muſt object the like
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to S. Auſtin (cited, and approved by Potter (Pag: 125.) and
ſo the Doctot muſt be involved in the ſame contradiction) ſaying (de vn
it. Eccleſ: cap: 13.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Periiſſe dicunt de coetero mundo
Eccleſiam, &amp; in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Donati in ſola Africa manſiſſe.</q> And
you know very well, that Ch: Ma: in that place, ſpeakes not of the
periſhing, or extinction of the Church, abſolutely but expreſly, as it
was aſſerted by the Donatiſts.</p>
               <p n="14">14. All that you haue (N. 18.) hath been anſwered, in
ſeverall places, and it ſeemes you are too well furniſhed with leaſure,
when (N. 19.) to <pb n="896" facs="tcp:59214:464"/>the demand of Ch: Ma: (Pag: 251. How can
the <hi>Church more truly be ſayd to periſh, then when ſhe is permitted
to maintaine a damnable Hereſy?</hi>) You anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, <hi>ſhe may more truly
be ſayd to periſh, when ſhe is not only permitted to doe ſoe, but de
facto doth maintaine a damnable Hereſy;</hi> as if when we ſay, God
permitted one to fall, into ſuch a ſinne, it did not ſignify, that de
facto he fell into it. But here you diſcover, a ſecret poiſon, that Faith
is not the guift of God, nor requires his particular aſſiſtance to
perſever therin, which if it were ſubſtracted, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo we be permitted
to fall, we ſhall be too ſure to fall de facto; otherwiſe it followes,
that by our owne naturall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we may belieue, and perſever in Faith. In
the reſt of your inſtances, that the Church may be more truly ſayd to
periſh, if ſhe fall into Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy Fundamentall of it ſelfe, you doe but
trifle, ſeing that either one truth, cannot be more true then an other, as
divers teach; or elſe you know, that for our purpoſe, it is more then
ſufficient, that it be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and abſolutly, and vnavoydably true,
that the Church muſt periſh, if ſhe fall into any damnable errour. But
the truth is, you vſe this art, to divert the Reader, from the Demand of Ch:
Ma: that he might not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, your not giving Anſwer thereto: and
therfor, I muſt returne to make the ſame demand; Whether the Church, were
not truly ſayd to periſh, if ſhe did fall into any damnable Hereſy? Or
whether Hereſy may conſiſt with ſalvation? Or whether it be not
Hereſy, to reject any truth ſufficiently propounded as delivered by the
word of God? Where I muſt put you in minde, that you forget your owne
Doctrine; that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not an object of our Faith, but that one may be
ſaved, though he reject it, and yet here you ſay of the Church; <hi>She may
more truly be ſayd to periſh, when ſhe rejects even thoſe truths, out
of which her hereſies may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as if ſhe ſhould directly deny
the Scripture to be the Word of God.</hi> How will you avoyd, but that
according to this laſt ſaying of yours, yourſelfe and your aſſociats,
are no members of any Church, ſeing you teach that the Scripture may be
denyed, to be the word of God, as not being a materiall object of Faith? Or how
muſt not your errours be deſperate without poſſibility of being
reformed, ſince you may reject thoſe meanes by which alone, according to
Proteſtants, they can be reformed? Or how could you ſay truly, That a
Church lapſed may be recovered, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Scripture, if you be not
obliged to belieue Scripture itſelfe, by an act of Faith, or as an object of
Faith?</p>
               <p n="15">15. In your (N. 20.) you doe but repeate, what you ſay
elſe where; That if the viſible Church be an infallible guide, it is
ſtrange, the <pb n="897" facs="tcp:59214:464"/>Scripture doth nowhere ſay ſo, in
plaine termes. To which I anſwer, as heretofore, that we proue the
infallibility of the Church, independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Scripture: That Scripture alſo
ſpeakes clearly enough therof; That I may as well aske of you, why the
Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts haue not delivered clearly, theſe or the like
Propoſitions? Scripture alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines all things belonging to Faith; That
it is evident in all neceſſary points &amp;c. or, Be ſure to belieue a
certaine man, who will come to oppoſe the errors of the Roman Church, called
Luther &amp;c. Nay, though the Scripture had ſayd, belieue the Roman Church
in all things, which ſhe propoſes, you would not haue wanted evaſions, by
ſaying, we ſhould belieue her, as far as ſhe agreed with Scripture, or in

               <p n="16">16. Ch: Ma: (Pag: 251. N. 18.) ſayth: 
<q rend="margQuotes">The Holy Scriptures and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers aſſigne ſeparation from the viſible Church as a marke of
Hereſy, which he proves by ſome textes of Scripture; as (1. Joan: 2.19.)
They went out from vs; And (Actor: 15.24.) Some went out from vs; and (Actor:
20.30.) Out of you ſhall ariſe men ſpeaking perverſe things.</q> This,
ſay you, is <hi>certainly a ſtrange and vnheard of ſtraine of Logick,
vnless we will ſay that euery text whe in it is ſayd that ſome body, goes
out from ſome body affoards an argument for this purpos:</hi> and yet you
confeſſe that <hi>Hereticks doe alwayes ſeparate from the viſible
Church; but that they who doe ſoe are not alwayes Heretiks.</hi> Now if all
Heretiks ſeparate from the viſible Church, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet doe not ſeparate from
every ſome body (for they doe not ſeparate from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their
owne Aſſociates) it is a ſigne, that their is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betwixt
ſome ſome body, and orhers ſome body, betweene ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the
Church, or the Congregation of the Faithfull, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> every other ſome body.
But if I proue theſe propoſitions; every Heretik ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates from the
Church, and, every one that ſeparates from the Church is an Heretik, to be
convertible, you will yeald ſuch a ſeparation to be a Mark of Hereſy.
This is eaſily done, by taking your owne grant, That Heretiks do always
ſeparate from the Church. For Hereſy being an error againſt ſome
revealed truth, if the Church alſo may erre againſt any ſuch truth, there
is no neceſſity, that an Heretik ſhould ſeparate from the Church, but
may very well agree with her in ſuch error, and ſo the firſt part of your
aſſertion (that Heretiques do alwayes ſeparate from the Church) would be
falſe: or if the Church cannot erre; every one who ſeparates from her, in
matters of Faith, muſt be guilty of an errour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Faith, and ſo be
an Heretik: if therfore the firſt part of your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion 
<pb n="898" facs="tcp:59214:465"/>be true, you muſt grant, that the ſecond is falſe;
and that, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heretik ſeparates from the Church, ſo
converſivè every one, who ſeparates from the Church, in matters of
beliefe, is an Heretik; and then it is no wonder, if Scripture, and Fathers,
aſſigne a ſeparation, or going out of the Church, as a mark of Hereſy.
Which may be further declared in this manner. If all Heretiks ſeparate from
the Church, the reaſon muſt be, becauſe there is in the Church,
ſomething incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with their Hereſy, which can be nothing, but the
true Doctrine and Beliefe, which ſhe holds, and is oppoſite to the error,
which makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Heretiks, and which whoſoever hold, are Heretiks, and
conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whoſoever leaves the Church, by occaſion of ſuch errors,
are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, and if they had not held ſuch errors, they had remained in the
Church; Therefore, for the ſame reaſon, for which all Heretiks for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Church, we muſt neceſſarily inferr, that whoſoever forſake the
Churches doctrine are Heretiks; that is, for the errors, which they hold
againſt the truth, which the Church is ſuppoſed to belieue; and if ſhe
be ſuppoſed to belieue an error, an heretique may belieue the ſame and
ſo goe out of her, no more, than ſhe goes out of herſelf. For this
cauſe, our Saviour ſaied (Matth. 24.26.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">If therefore they ſhall ſay vnto
you behold he is in the deſert, goe you not forth:</q> Of which words Henoch
Clapham (in his ſouveraigne remedy againſt Schiſme Pag: 23.) ſayth,
that <hi>therby our Saviour forbids going out vnto ſuch deſert and corner
Ghoſpells;</hi> which declares that going out of the Church is Hereſy, or
Schiſme, and not only, that all Heretiks, or Schiſmaticks goe out. And now
I hope you being convinced by Reaſon, will be better diſpoſed to receiue
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the true expoſition of the text alleadged aboue by Ch: Ma: of
which you ſay; <hi>For the first place, there is no certainty that it

denyed Ieſus to be the Chriſt.</hi> Anſwer: That S. John ſpeakes of
Heretiks, will appeare by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Cornelius a Lapide vpon this pſace, who
cites holy Fathers to the ſame purpos. See alſo the annotation of the
Rhemes Teſtament, vpon this Chapter of S. John. (Uerſ: 18.) ſhewing out
of S. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that all who ſeparate themſelves from the Church, are called

that the text, (Act: 15.24.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Some went out from vs,</q> muſt not
ſpeake of Heretiks, that is of perſons, who held an errour againſt a
revealed truth, of which ſome might haue been ſufficiently informed, before
the Councell, and Definition, or Declaration of the Apoſtles; and that ſome
did proceed, in a turbulent, and as a man may ſay, Hereticall manner,
appeares by reading the ſame Chapter in the Acts. And for our preſent
purpoſe, it is ſufficient, that ſeparation from the Church, is a ſigne,
at leaſt of a materiall Hereſie, or Heretique; ſince the being a formall
He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique, depends vpon individuall, perſonall, and accidentall
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of which to judg in particular, is the part of prudence, not
of Faith; though if once the partie know, that his opinyon, is contrary to the
Doctrine of the Church, and will yet perſiſt therin, and rather leaue the

this to be the ſenſe, of the Holy Fathers, Ch: Ma. hath proved; and now we

               </p>
               <p n="20">20. To theſe Authorityes, you anſwer; <hi>That the

And a man may be juſtly excommunicated for many other ſufficient cauſes

               </p>
               <p n="21">21. Anſwer; I haue often put you in minde, and the
thing is evident of it ſelf, and ſtill to be repeated, that Luther
ſeparated not only from the Roman Church, but from all true Churches of the
whole world, who all agreed with the Roman, as alſo from all true Churches of
many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Ages, which if you once ſuppoſe to haue erred, againſt
the Word of God, the Rule of thoſe Fathers, That ſeparation from the Church
is a mark of Hereſy, had bene plainly impertinent, and of no vſe at all.
For ſtill the Queſtion would haue remayned, whether the Church of all Ages
had erred, as well as the preſent Church; ſince we cannot know what the
Ancient Church taught, except vpon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and Tradition of middle ages
till our tyme, which paſſage if it be ſtopt, and bridge broken, we muſt
liue in ignorance; and not be able ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly, and per ſaltum, to reach
immediatly, from the laſt to the firſt. Beſides, you hold, all Churches
of all Ages to be fallible, and not to deliver vniverſally any other point,
except that Scripture is the Word of God; and therefore it is a meere evaſion
in you to make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, for matters of doctrine, betweene the whole
preſent viſible Church, and the Churches of all Ages; and if ſeparation
from theſe be a mark of Hereſy, ſeparation from that muſt alſo be
ſuch: Yea S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian ſpeakes expreſſly of the, then preſent, Church:
<hi>Not we departed from them, but they from vs; and ſince Hereſies and
Schiſmes are bred aftherwards, while they make themſelves divers
Conventicles, they haue forſaken the head and origen of Truth.</hi> As for S.
Proſper; you do not defend, but impugne him. But I wonder you will offer your
Reader, ſuch toyes, as you produce <pb n="901" facs="tcp:59214:466"/>for good Arguments,
againſt the words of that Saint, which are both evidently true, and coherent
with themſelves. For, as whoſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates with the vniverſall
Church in Faith, and externall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a Catholique, (which was the
firſt part of S. Proſpers ſentence) ſo it is vniverſally true, that,
whoſoever is divided from the Church in Faith, and externall communion, is an
Heretique, as S. Proſper affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the latter parte of his ſpeach, and
which you know is the thing which <hi>Charity Maintayned</hi> intends to proue;
and which makes your tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>meere Schiſme without any mixture of
Hereſy,</hi> to be wholy imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; ſeing we treate of diviſion both
in Faith, and externall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: though it be alſo true, that Schiſme is
wont to end in Hereſy, as <hi>Cha. Ma.</hi> (Part. 1. Chap. 5. N 3.) declares
out of S. Hierom, and others. No less impertinent, is your objection, taken
from perſons divided from the Church, by the Cenſure of Excommunication,
which is a kind of Diviſion, in many reſpects, far different from
ſeparation by Schiſme, or Hereſy, (as hath bene declared heretofore at
large) and which is not incurred at all, in the ſight of God, if the
Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be vnjuſt. Agreable to this doctrine of theſe Fathers, is
that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent document of S. Optatus (Lib. 1. contra Parm.) how to judg who
be Schiſmatiques, and Heretiques: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Uidendum eſt, quis in radice cum toto

Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants by the Rule of this holy, and ancient Father, you cannot but
condemne them of Schiſme, and Hereſy.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Your (N, 22.) being but a paſſage to the next
Section; I neede only ſaie, that there is great difference, between
Catholiques, and Proteſtants in order to the admitting, or rejecting, ſome
doctrine of ſome particular Fathers, ſeing we, for interpreting Scripture,
and all Points of Faith, acknowledg an infallible guide, to whom even the
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers themſelves humbly ſubmit; but when you forſake the Fathers, be
they never ſo many, the compariſon runnes not betwene them, and Gods

ſooner belieue the Holy Fathers, for the interpretation of 
<pb n="902" facs="tcp:59214:467"/>Scripture, than ſuch men, as can neither agree
amongſt themſelves, nor with the whole Church of God? And if you will but
heare, what your owne knowledg, and conſcience, tells you, you will confess,
that you acknowledged, the ancient Fathers to ſtand for vs.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Your (N. 23.) is employed in anſwering ſome
Authorityes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Ch. Ma.,</hi> out of S. Hierom, wherein you
ſhew the litle rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon you make of the holy Fathers; ſince you do covertly,
or rather, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly, tax this bleſſed Saint of writing over-truths,
and you know what it is to write beyond truth, which in true Philoſophy
conſiſt in indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili, and what is beyond it, muſt be againſt it.
The words of S. Hierom (Ep 57. ad Damas.) are theſe: 
<q rend="margQuotes">I am in the Communion of the Chaire of
Peter; I know the Church is built vpon that Rock. Whoſoever ſhall eate the
Lambe out of this houſe he is profane. If any ſhall not be in the Arke of
Noe, he ſhall periſh in the time of the deluge. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth not
gather with thee, doth ſcatter, that is, he that is not of Chriſt is of
Antichriſt. And (Lib. 1. Apolog.) which doth he call his Faith? That of the
Roman Church? Or that which is contained in the Books of Origen? If he
anſwer, the Roman; then we are Catholiques who haue tranſlated nothing of
the error of Origen. And yet further (Ibid. Lib. 3.) know thou that the Roman
Faith commended by the voyce of the Apoſtle doth not receyue theſe
deluſions, though an Angell ſhould denounce otherwiſe, than it hath once
bene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ached.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. To theſe words of S. Hierom you anſwer. Firſt,
that he writing to Damaſus a Pope, might be apt to write over-truths. An
anſwer not deſerving a confutation! Secondly, you ſay, S. Hierom
<hi>choſe rather to believe the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes Canonicall, vpon
the Authority of the Eaſterne Church, then to reject it from the Canon vpon
the Authority of the Roman.</hi> But this hath bene anſwered heretofore;
neither was there ever any decree of the Roman Church, Pope, or Councell,
excluding, that Epiſtle from the Canon, or rejecting any Book, of the old, or
New Teſtament, which was afterward admitted. Thirdly, you ask; <hi>How was it
poſsible that S. Hierom ſhould ever belieue that Liberius Biſpop of Rome
either was or could haue bene wrought over by the ſollicitation of
Fortunatianus Biſhop of Aquileiae, and brought after two yeares baniſhment
to ſubſcribe Hereſy?</hi> Sr. It is a ſigne you want ſolid
Objections, when you fly to ſo farre fetched evaſions; and your proceeding
is inexcuſable, in diſſembling the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which <hi>Ch. Ma.</hi>
(Part. 2. Chap. 3, N. 30.) gives out of Baronius, <pb n="903" facs="tcp:59214:467"/>Ann.
357. and Bellarmine (De Roman. Pont. Lib. 4. Cap. 9.) who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that
Liberius never ſubſcribed to Arianiſme, or any error againſt Faith, but
only to a Point which concerned matter of fact; and even greater Proteſtants
than you, doubt of that which you will needs haue to be vndoubted. But indeed
this old Objection is directly nothing to the purpoſe, of proving that
Liberius did ever define ex cathedra, any errour againſt Faith, but only that
de facto, by force of feare, theates, baniſhment, and other ſufferings, he
did ſubſcribe againſt S. Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, as S. Peter denied our Saviour,
without forfeit of his Faith (though he failed in the profeſſion thereof)
our Saviour having ſaied, 
<q rend="margQuotes">O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravi pro te Petre, vtnon deficiat Fides tua:</q> or, as the
ſame Apoſtle was reprehended by S. Paul, even after, the comming of the
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and yet I hope you will not denie, but that one might haue
ſaied, <hi>I am in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio of the Chair of Peter, I know that the Church
is built vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tkat Rock; whoſoever gathereth not with thee ſcattereth;</hi>
and the ſame I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> S. Hierom might haue ſaied of, and to Liberius,
defining, as Pope, not as failing in fact, as a man; and we ſee, that both
before, and after, that forced act, he was conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, not only in the true
faith, which he never loſt, but alſo in the profeſſion thereof, and
what he did by force, and feare, muſt no more be imputed to him, as Pope,
than a confeſſion extorted by torture, can be of force, without a voluntary
ratification. Our Saviour ſaied, men were to obey the words of the Scribes,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Phariſees, not their deeds. Is it not a doctrine of your owne, (Pag. 144:
N. 31.) that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Apoſtles <hi>was either fals or vncertain,
in no part of that which they delivered
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onſtantly?</hi> And
certaine it is, that Liberius did not make good his ſubſcription (if ever
he ſubſcribed to an errour) but revoked it, aſſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne as he was at
liberty, and (as I may ſay) taken of the Torture; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before, he had
defended the Catholique truth. If Marcellinus ſacrificed to Idolls; who will
therefore ſay, that he believed, or defined Idolary to be Lawfull? And
vniverſally, if you will judg mens Faith by their Actions, whoſoever
committs theft, murther, or any other ſinne againſt the commandements,
muſt be condemned for an Heretique, as believing theft to be Lawfull.
Finally, if you will haue the ſtrength of of S. Hieroms Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to
coſiſt in this, that Damaſus was in the right, only actually, and
accidentally, the Saint had begged the Queſtion, and proved his owne Doctrine
to be true, becauſe Damaſus held with him, and that which Damaſus held,
de facto was true, though Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus might erre, as other Biſhops might;
whereas it is cleare, that S. <pb n="904" facs="tcp:59214:468"/>Hierom (as his words
express) grounds himſelf, vpon that firme and ſtable Rock, of which our
Saviour ſaied, Thou art a Rock, and vpon this Rock. &amp;c. And this laſt
overthrowes the evaſion to which you
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llie (N. 24.) for
interpreting the words of S. Ambros.</p>
               <p n="25">25. For your (N. 25.26.27.) I wonder how you could
diſſemble what Ch. Ma. hath (Part. 2. Chap. 2. N. 31.) whereof ſee alſo
Bellarm in (De Rom. Pont. Lib. 4. Cap. 7.) where this matter is handled at
large. And who will not make a difference betwene S. Cyprian, being
diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terreſſed, and delivering a generall Doctrine, and preſcriptions
againſt all Heretiques, and S. Cyprian, ſpeaking in a particular point,
wherein he was ingaged, and which Proteſtants confess to haue bene an errour,
condemned by the whole Church, againſt the Donatiſts (namely the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization of ſuch, as had bene baptized by Heretiques) and by thoſe
very Biſhops, who once adhered to S. Cyprian, as <hi>Charity. Maint.</hi> in
the place cited even now, ſhewes out of S. Hierom. And you do but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
your Reader, in not making a difference, betwene a Decree of Pope Stephen, and
a Definition of Faith, which difference you might haue learned in that very
place, which you cite out of Bellarmine, and we haue now alledged. In fine, all
muſt anſwer the difficulty about S. Cyprian, ſeing he was in an errour
againſt Faith, and therefore could be excuſed only by ignorance, or
pardoned by repentance. In vaine (N. 26.) you tax the translation of <hi>Ch.
Ma.</hi> as if he ſhould not haue ſaied out of S. Cyprian Epiſt. 55. ad
Cornel. <hi>(They are hold to ſaile to the Chaire of Peter, and to the
principall Church, from whence Prieſtly Vnity hath ſpruing. Neither do they
conſider, that they are Romans, whoſe Faith was commended, by the preaching
of the Apoſtle, to whom falſhood cannot haue acceſſe)</hi> but ſhould
haue ſayd, to whom perfidiouſness cannot haue acceſſe. But this you
ſay without proofe, againſt the ſcope and connection of S. Cyprians
words, which ſpeak of Faith commended by S. Paul (not of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) and
conſequently of falſhood or perfidiouſness, or errour contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to
Faith; not of perfidiouſness, contrarie to the Morall vertue of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.
For what congruity is there in this ſpeach? The Faith of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans is
commended by the Apoſtle, therefore perfidiousness, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious dealing
cannot haue access to them, as if all who belieue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, muſt alſo
beſincere, and vpright honeſt men! Wheras the conſequence is very good
and cleare, that if their Faith, be true, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour againſt Faith, or
falſhood, cannot be approved by them. You would proue that in vaine S.
Cyprian had exhorted Cornelius to take <pb n="905" facs="tcp:59214:468"/>heed of thoſe
Heretiques, if he had conceived the Biſhop of Rome, to be infallible for
matters of Faith; as if the certainty of attayning an end did exclude Meanes of
Exhortations, Praier, and the like: or as if God could not effectually moue vs,
to what he beſt pleaſes, vnless he alſo make vs belieue, that we may
tempt him, by omitting all diligence of our owne, towards the attaining of
that, to which he moves vs, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes a Promiſe, that he will grant it
vs. You ſay, if we belieue the Fathers of the Councell of Chalcedon, the
Prerogatiue of the Church of Rome of being the principall Church, was grounded

But I conceiue yourſelf cannot belieue, that the Greek Church, would or could
yeald ſuch a ſpirituall Prerogatiue to the Latine Church, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo
ſlight a ground; though that might be a kind of congruence, ſuppoſing an
other higher and ſtronger Reaſon, to wit, that S. Peter had lived and died
Biſhop of that Citie, which was, as I may ſaie, the Primate of Cities. Yet
I am not ſorie, to heare you ſay: <hi>We do not altogether deny, but that
the Church of Rome might be called the chaire of Peter, in regard he is ſayd
to haue preached the Goſpell there.</hi> For, to omit, that you dare not
deny, that S. Peter was at Rome (which ſome Proteſtants impudently deny)
you giue ſo poore a reaſon, why the Church of Rome, hath bene
particularlie, by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, called the chaire of Peter, that every one may
ſee, there muſt be ſome better ground for it, than that which you
alledge, of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching in that Citie, as it is gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that he not only
preached in, but was Biſhop of the Citie of Antioch, and he preached in many
other places, which yet are not wont to be called the Chaire of Peter. I
beſeech the Reader to peruſe that learned Book called Anti-Mortonus
(againſt the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d impoſture of D. Morton) § 4. about the Councell of
Chalcedon; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he will find what Power was acknowledged to be in the Biſhop
of Rome aboue all Biſhops through the whole world: to ſay nothing for the

who any way either by evill complacence of themſelves, or vaine glory, or by

For to this Church for a more powerfull principality, it is neceſſary that

anſwers, which vpon examination, will be found inſufficient, and contrary
to yourſelf. You ſay: the words ſet downe by Ch: Ma: <hi>ſhew, that
what Authority in the matter S. Irenaeus attributed to the Roman Church in
particular, the ſame for the kind (though p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rhaps not in the ſame degree) he attributed to
all other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique Churches;</hi> Anſwer, S. Irenaeus is ſo farre
from affirming an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity betwene the Roman, and other Churches: that he
expreſly prefers her before the reſt, in ſuch manner, as though the
reſt had then had no Being, yet all Heretiques might haue bene confuted by
her ſole autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For, ſeing he acknowledges it needless, to number the
ſucceſſions of other Churches; in order to the force of his Argument, he
might as well haue ſuppoſed them not to exiſt, as not to be
neceſſarily taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; which he never ſaied of any other
Apoſtolique Church. Beſide, ſince he takes the Roman, for as good as all
other Apoſtolique Churches, and (for the ſame reaſon) of all other
Churches of that tyme (whoſe ſucceſſours he held it needless to reckon)
it being impoſſible that all Churches ſhould faile in Faith, we muſt
conclude, even out of S. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus his Reaſon, that the Roman Church cannot
faile in points of Belief. And (as for you) I wonder how you would end your (N.
28.) in theſe words <hi>If v. Irenaeus thought the Teſtimony of the Roman
Church in this point only humane and fallible, then ſurely he could never
think, either adhering to it a certain marke of a Catholique, or ſeparation
from it a certain marke of a Heretique</hi>) For, ſeing Cyou hold hriſtian
Faith te be no more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that the Tradition for which you
receyue Scripture, is humane and fallible, how can you, (theſe your
aſſertions ſuppoſed) affirme, that a teſtimony humane and fallible
may not be ſufficient, to proue one a Catholique or Heretique? Vnless you
will ſay, he is no Heretique who rejects Scripture, and all Chriſtianity,
nor that he is a Catholique, who believes them, becauſe you profess that the

you and other Proteſtants are wont to giue to S. Auſtine, or other Fathers
is inſufficient, to wit; That they alledg againſt Heretiques the Authority
of the Church, not becauſe they believed her to be infallible, but becauſe
ſhe was at that time pure in her Doctrines; which had bene only to begg the

<hi>to this Church by reaſon it is placed in the Imperiall Citty, whither all
mens affares doe neceſſarily draw them, or by reaſon of the powerfull
Principality it hath over all the adjacent Churches, there is &amp;c. Who if
there had bene any alteration in this Church of Rome, could not in all
probability but haue obſerved it. But they to the contrary, haue alwaies
obſerved in this Church the very Tradition which came from the Apoſtles and
no other.</hi> Which retortion growes to be more ſtrong, if we conſider,
that from Chriſt our Lord and Saviour, to the time of S. Irenaeus there
paſſed about the ſame number of yeares, which are numbred betwene S.
Auſtine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and S. Gregory the Great, and yet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants commonly
grant, that in S. Auſtines tyme the Church was free from thoſe (falſely
pretended) errours, which they ſay were found in the tyme of S. Gregory: and
therefore you muſt either grant, That S. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus did vainely impugne
thoſe old Heretiques, and that you againſt reaſon approue his Argument
againſt them, or els that our new ſectaries <pb n="909" facs="tcp:59214:470"/>cannot
poſſibly avoide the Argument, which we Catholiques vrge, to proue, that it
was impoſſible, ſo many, ſo great, and ſo manifeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
ſhould in ſo ſhort a tyme, poſſess the whole Church of God;
eſpecially ſeing, to the contrary, all men, in all, and every one of
thoſe Ages, did conceyue, that they could obſerue in the Church of Rome the
very Tradition which came from the Apoſtles, and no other. And if
not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, you ſay, That betwene the tyme of S. Auſtine, and
the Popedome of S. Gregory, ſo manie errours might enter, without being
eſpied: you make the argument of S. Irenaeus to be of no force at all, and
ſo you muſt either agree, with Papiſts, againſt your Proteſtant
Brethren; or diſagree both from S. Irenaeus, and yourſelf, with whom you
cannot agree, vnless you relinquiſh thoſe your pretended Brethren: and
finally we muſt conclude, that no convincing argument could be brought
againſt Heretiques, drawen from the Tradition of the Roman Church, if once we
grant that ſhe is not infallible in her traditions wherin if ſhe be

of &amp;c: (Pag: 87.88.89.) who, convinced by evidence of truth, not only
confeſſes, and proves <hi>the weakeness of that place in S. Iuſtine, to
conclude any thing againſt Catholique Tradition,</hi> but alſo
demonſtrates, that your allegation is an egregious falſification, while you
ſay, <hi>Iuſtine martyr profeſſeth that all good and Orthodox
Chriſtians of his time believed it, and thoſe that did not he reckons
amongſt Heretiques.</hi> For S. Juſtine expresly affirmes, <hi>that many
doe not acknowledg this doctrine of the</hi> 1000. <hi>yeares, and thoſe many
Chriſtians, that are of pure and pious opinyon or judgment;</hi> and that
thoſe whom he calls, <hi>nominall Christians, Atheiſts, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious hereticall
leaders,</hi> are they, <hi>who denyed the reſurrection,</hi> not thoſe
<hi>that acknowledg the reſurrection, and denyed the Millennium.</hi> And the
Doctour concludes in theſe very words: <hi>By Iuſtine it cannot be
concluded, that the</hi> 1000. <hi>yeares was a matter of Catholike belief in
his time, but only favourd by him, and many others, and conſequently, though
that were after condemned in the Church, would it not be from this teſtimony
inferred that a Catholick Doctrine. (much leſſe a Tradition) were
condemned.</hi> And he gives vs a Rule, whereby we may anſwer all that can be
objected out of S. Irenaeus, or any other ancient Author; ſaying (Pag 91.)
<hi>I confess I acknowledg my opinion, that there were in that age men
otherwiſe minded, as out of Iustin it appeared.</hi> I could cite an other,
highly qualifyed Proteſtant, who this very yeare 1651. hath putin print, that
Juſtin confeſſes, that <hi>ſome good and honeſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did not
acknowledg</hi> that Doctrine of the Millenaries, which the Doctor (Pag: 88.)
ſhewes very well, not to be repugnant to an other ſaying of S. Juſtin, to
which this laſt Author ſayes it is repugnant. Now I beſeech you
conſider, how you can impugne Gods Church, by a pretended tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which
not only Catholiques, but even learned Proteſtants, out of S. Juſtines
words, denie to haue bene Catholique or vniverſall, in his time, and which
this Doctor avouches, not to be aſſerted as vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall by the Lord
Faulkland himſelf; whereby this Objection ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeted in your Booke,
comes to juſt nothing: and I haue wondered that ſo worme-eaten, and
obſolete a thing, as this is, ſhould be revived, and vrged as a
Demonſtration againſt the Traditions of the Church. But it is Gods
Goodness, to confound the enemyes of his Church, by their owne wiſdome, and
confute them by their owne arguments: and is it not a great proofe for the
infallibility of the Church, that theſe her adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, 
<pb n="913" facs="tcp:59214:472"/>after all labour, and ſtudy, can alledg only ſuch a
toy as this, to proue the fallibility of the Church for ſo many Ages, wherein
ſhe could not but haue fallen into many mote, and greater, errours, if ſhe
had bene ſubject to accept, and deliver fals, or apocryphall Traditions? If
you haue a mind to ſpeak to the purpoſe, you muſt produce ſome cleare
and vndoubted Tradition, or ſome Definition of a Pope, or Councell, for this
of the Chiliaſts, or any other errour. But this is as impoſſible for you
to doe, as that God can break his Promiſe, that the gates of hell ſhall not
prevaile againſt her, and that he will be with her to the worlds end. You
ſay; <hi>If this Tradition of a thouſand yeares was not conſerved, and
obſerved in the Church of Rome, had Irenaeus known ſo much, he muſt haue
retracted this commendation of that Church.</hi> Not ſo, by your leaue; but,
as a true child of Gods Church, if he had bene perſwaded his opinyon to be
againſt her Tradition, he would haue retracted his opinyon, and not his
commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church, vpon which he builded his Doctrine againſt
thoſe Heretiques, whom he impugned: otherwiſe his argument take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from her
Tradition, had bene of no force, but petitio principij, proving their
He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies to be falſe, becauſe the Church of Rome, which in thoſe
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars did not erre, taught the particular opinyons of thoſe men to be
falſe. Eſpecially, ſince by the confeſſion of S. Juſtin, <hi>Many
Chriſtians of pure and pious judgment, held the contrary.</hi>

may be Heretiques, whether they will or no, if your objection were of any

ſinning or not ſinning depends not on theſe things. As therefore men may
be Heretiques, and ſinners; becauſe de facto God conſerves Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and preſerves men in their being; ſo, ſeing he hath promiſed to
conſerue his Church, without errour againſt Faith, and gives every one
ſufficient grace, to follow her Directions, if they refuſe to doe ſo,
they become Heretiques, by their owne free-will, not by any neceſſity. Your

ſome are evidently fals, and all, of no force againſt vs. You ask whether
<hi>Ch: Ma: in ſaying the Donatists Sect was confined to Africa, do not
forget himſelf, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict what he ſaied (N:</hi> 17.) <hi>that they

but they had ſome of their Sect in Rome, and you expreſly affirme it; yet
becauſe they were ſo few, as could not make any conſiderable number, it
may well be ſaied, that their Sect de facto was confined to Africa, as they
were wont to ſay, and as <hi>Ch: Ma:</hi> 
                  <pb n="617" facs="tcp:59214:474"/>muſt

not erre into one Faith, muſt be, becauſe error could not conſiſt with
one Faith; for if it could, they might erre into one Faith; and ſo your
Tranſlation, if it be good, muſt be beholding to his expreſſion. You
ſay in the (Pag: 362.) that the Roman <hi>Church is Catholique to herſelf

this (Pag: 332. N. 11.) you ſay, It is not Hereſy to oppoſe any Truth
propounded by the Church, but only ſuch a Truth as is an eſſentiall part
of the Goſpell of Chriſt: Which ſentences put together conclude, the
Roman Church to want what is eſſentiall to a Church, and yet you expresly
teach in other parts of your Book, that ſhe errs not in eſſentiall or

this? As alſo, in your ſaying, that it is not Hereſy to oppoſe any
truth, but only ſuch a truth as in an eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all part of the Goſpell?
Do you not profess through your whole Book that voluntary error againſt any

ſo repugnant to himſelf as you are! Now, for your (N. 41.) If the true
Church cannot be without Succeſſion of Biſhops, whatſoever Church wants

prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, <pb n="920" facs="tcp:59214:476"/>attaine not that End for the procuring
whereof they were preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. From whence will follow this principally
intended concluſion, that the only effectuall meanes, to compass that end,
muſt be to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg an infallible Living Guide. And I pray, what impiety
or ſophiſtry is there in this? You ſay, <hi>The first of thoſe
ſuppoſitions,</hi> (that every Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant is perſwaded, that his
opinions are true) <hi>muſt needs be true, but the ſecond is apparently
falſe: I meane, that every Protestant is perſwaded, that he hath vſed
thoſe meanes which are preſcribed for vnderstanding of Scripture. But that
which you collect from theſe ſuppoſitions is cleerely inconſequent, and
by as good Logick you might conclude, that Logick and Geometry ſtands vpon no
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine grounds, becauſe the diſagreements of Logicians and Geometricians
ſhew, that ſome of them are deceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="40">40. Anſwer; If every Proteſtant be not perſwaded,
that he hath vſed thoſe means, which are preſcribed for vnderſtanding
of Scripture, you will not be able to defend, that the firſt part of the
ſuppoſition muſt needs be true, to wit, that every Proteſtant is
perſwaded, that his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are true. For if he be not perſwaded, that he
hath vſed ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he cannot pretend to be ſure that his opinions
are true, and then it is cleare, that he who profeſſes not to be ſure
that Protaſtant Religion is true, is no Proteſtant, nor of any Religion, if
he doubt of all, or be not certaine of any. And, that which Ch: Ma: collects
from thoſe ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to be cleerely conſequent, appeares, even by
your inſtances to the contrarie, which are retorted; thus: If you ſuppoſe
men to follow the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and Principles of Logick, and Geometry, and yet
diſagree (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſome of them to be deceyved) you muſt
conclude, that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and Geometry ſtand vpon no certaine grounds. Now our
ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (for the preſent) is, that Proteſtants make vſe of
thoſe meanes, which they preſcribe for vnderſtanding Scripture, and yet
diſagree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves (and conſequently ſome of them muſt be
deceived) Therefore we muſt conclude, that thoſe meanes are not certaine,
nor that they haue any certaine ground, whereon to relie, for vnderſtanding
Scripture, which is the Concluſion of Ch: Ma: In the ſame manner I
anſwer, and, retort your other inſtances; That if Chriſtians were
ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to vſe aright all the meanes they haue, for finding the truth
in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d men be ſuppoſed to procede according to the true
Rules of Reaſon and men did diſagree, we might well inferr, that neither
Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion, nor Reaſon, ſtand vpon certaine grounds: and the
ſame retortion may be applied to your other inſtances, But Sr., though you 
<pb n="921" facs="tcp:59214:476"/>ſay it is fals, that every Proteſtant, is
<hi>perſwaded that he hath vſed thoſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which are preſcribed for
vnderſtanding Scripture;</hi> yet it might ſeeme a hard cenſure in you
(who pretend ſo much charity, the property whereof, you ſay, is to judge
the beſt) to judg, that of ſo very many diſagreeing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
ſome haue not vſed the meanes which they preſcribe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for
vnderſtanding Scripture, and if they haue, it being cleare by their
diſagreeing, that ſome are in an errour, it followes, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are
in themſelves defectiue, vncertaine, and inſufficient.</p>
               <p n="41">41. And in this occaſion, I muſt not omitt to declare
the Reaſon why Almighty God, doth not concurre with Heretiques, to the
conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Nations to Chriſtian Religion; becauſe indeed they might
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, vpon examination, diſcover that the grounds of thoſe by whom
they were converted, cannot ſupport a certainty in Faith, as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and ſo they would judge themſelves rather to haue bene delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or (to
vſe your owne word) tantalized, than converted; and might be tempted, to
revolt from Chriſt, till they could find ſome Rock, to which God himſelf
hath promiſed eternall ſtability. Beſides ſeing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion,
cannot be wholy true, as conſiſting of contrary Sects, if God did
ordinarily cooperate with them in order to ſo ſupernaturall a work, he
might ſeeme to giue them the credit of true Teachers, and to countenance, and
confirme a falſhood, which is impoſſible for him to doe. And even from
hence, we may gather à poſteriori, that Proteſtant Religion is not
true, ſeing God doth not take them for his inſtruments to convert Nations,
or work Miracles.</p>
               <p n="42">42. All that you ſay (N. 48.) hath bene anſwered
heretofore at large. To your (N. 49.) whether he who erres againſt any one
revealed truth looſeth all Divine Faith (as Ch: Ma: ſaied (N. 29.)
Catholique Divines generally reach) I anſwer. Firſt; That in reaſon,
Proteſtants ought to make greater account of the Authority of Catholique
Divines (beſides whom there were no Orthodox Doctors before Luther, and ſo
to depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue them of eſtimation and authority, cannot be donne without
preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the vniverſall and Catholique Church, and all Chriſtianity)
than any Catholique, or any prudent man can make of learned Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who
in their oppoſition to Catholiques, are contrary to all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Churches, before Luther, and write, to maintayne ſuch their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
whereas Catholique Divines, who wrote before Luther, could not haue any
purpoſe to impugne Proteſtants; yea the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Proteſtants
among themſelves, and agreement with vs, againſt <pb n="922" facs="tcp:59214:477"/>their pretended Brethren, muſt needs very much diminiſh their
autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and if they remaine with any eſtimation, or authority, it makes
for vs, with whom the chiefeſt among them agree in many, and great points, of
Faith. You ſay; D. Potter alledged not the meere Authority of Pappus and
Flacius to proue this diſagreement of Catholiques among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, but
proved it with the <hi>formall words of Bellarmine, faithfully collected by
Pappus.</hi> But I pray you, that this collection was faithfull, or to the
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, how doth Dr. Potter proue, otherwiſe than by taking it vpon the
credit and Authority of Pappus, ſeing the Doctor doth not alledg, ſo much
as any one inſtance in particular? As for the pretended diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
among Catholiques; they can be only in matters diſputable, or not defined by
the Church, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which definition if any ſhould ſwarue, he were no
Catholique; and for other matters, we are content, that Pappus muſter not
only 237., but as many more points, as he pleaſes. For by ſuch a
multiplication, he will onlie make an Addition to his owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
Impertinences: as your alledging the Example of Brereley is a meere
impertinence, it being cleare, that he alledges the diſagreeing of
Proteſtants among themſelves, not only in by-matters, or in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or
reaſon of their Aſſertions, but even in the concluſions themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves;
and not only as diſagreeing among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, but as directly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with vs, againſt other Proteſtants, in the very concluſions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I
deſire the Reader, for his owne good, and full ſatisfaction, to peruſe
Brereley in his Advertiſment to him that ſhall anſwer his treatiſe, and
his preface to the Chriſtian Reader, Catholick, or Proteſtant.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Secondly, Though you are pleaſed to call it
weakness in Ch: Ma: to vrge Proteſtants with the authority of Catholique
Divines; yet you can haue no pretence to ſlight, men of their fame, and
learning, when they are conſidered, not as diſagreeing from Proteſtants
(nor in a Queſtion controverted betwene them and vs) but are ſeconded by
the chiefeſt, and learnedſt of them, (Proteſtants.) For what doth it
import Proteſtants, that Hereſie, or infidelity, deſtroies all Divine
Faith, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they will tacitely confess, or feare, that they are guilty of
thoſe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes? Let vs heare the verdit of ſome principall Proteſtants.
Luther (in Capit: 7. Matth.) ſaieth, <hi>Heretiques, are not
Chriſtians.</hi> And; <hi>Faith muſt be round that is, in all Articles
believing howſoever little matters.</hi> And in tria Symbola <hi>Chriſtian
Faith muſt be entire and perfect every waie. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it may be weak and
faint: yet it muſt needs be entire and true.</hi> And <hi>Epist. ad Albertum:
He doth not ſatisfie, if in other things he confess Chriſt and his 
<pb n="923" facs="tcp:59214:477"/>word. For who denieth Chriſt in one Article or word,
denieth him in all, ſeing there is one only Chriſt, the ſame in all.</hi>
The Magdeburgians (in Praefat: Centur: 6.) <hi>They are Anti-Chriſts, and
divels.</hi> Beza de puniendis haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis; <hi>They are infidels and
Apoſtates.</hi> Mort: (Lib: 1. Apolog. Cap: 7.) <hi>Either you muſt giue
the name of Catholiks to Proteſtants, or we muſt deny them the name of
Chriſtians.</hi> Yourſelf (Pag: 23. N, 27.) ſpeaking of Uerityes,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>vndoubted Books of Scripture,</hi> ſay; <hi>He that
doth not belieue all can hardly belieue any, neither haue we reaſon to
belieue he doth ſo;</hi> Which is more than Catholique Divines teach, who
affirme, that an heretique may belieue ſome articles of Faith, by an humane
opinion, not purelie for Divine Revelation; and ſo you alſo muſt
vnderſtand, that he who doth not belieue all that is contained in the
vndoubted Books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can hardly belieue any for the Authority of
Scripture, but if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them, it muſt be with mixture of ſome other

<hi>Wittenbergenſes, in Refutat. Orto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox: Conſenſus: As he who keepeth
all the Law, but offendeth in one, is (witness ſaint Iames) guilty of all: So
who believeth not, one word of Christ, though he ſeemes to belieue the other

incredulous.</hi> Schluſſelburgh (Lib. 1. Theolog. Calvin. Art. 1.)
<hi>Most truly wrote S. Chriſoſtom in</hi> 1. Gallat. <hi>He corupteth the

Ambroſe E: pist: ad demetriadem; he is out of the number of the Faithfull,
and lot of Saints, who diſſenteth in any point from the Catholike
Truth.</hi> Calvin (Epheſ: 4. V. 5.) vpon that: <hi>One God, one Faith,</hi>
writeth thus: <hi>As often as thou readeſt the word, one, vnderſtand it put
emphatically, as if he had ſaied, Christ cannot be divided, Faith cannot not
be parted.</hi> Perkins (in Explicat. Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Colum: 512) <hi>Thus indeed
fareth the matter, that a man failing in one article faileth and erreth in all.
Wherevpon Faith is termed an entire copulatiue.</hi> As I ſaied of your
words, ſo I ſay of theſe, that they containe more than Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
affirme, and to giue them a true ſenſe, they muſt be vnderſtood, that
he faileth and erreth, in as much, as he believes not with a divine but only
with an humane Faith. Spalatenſis (contra Suarem (C. 1. N. 7) <hi>Divine
Faith periſheth wholy by the least detraction, and conſequently, it is no

               </p>
               <p n="44">44. The ſame is the Doctrine of the ancient Fathers:
Tertullian (de praeſcrip: Cap: 2.) ſaieth: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Hereſies are to deſtroy Faith, and
bring ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death. And (Cap 37.) If they be heretiks, they can be no
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. <pb n="924" facs="tcp:59214:478"/>S. Cyprian (Epiſt: 73.) ſaieth, that
both by the teſtimonie of the Goſpell and Apoſtle, Heretiks are called
Anti-chriſts. S. Auſtine, (Enchirid: Cap: 5.) Chriſt, in name only, is
found with any Heretiks. S. Chryſoſtom cited by Ch: Ma: (N. 33. in Galat
17.) ſaieth, that the leaſt error in matter of Faith, deſtroieth Faith.
Let them heare (ſayth this holy Father) what S. Paul ſayth: Namely that
they who brought in ſome ſmall errour had overthrowne the Ghoſpell. For,
to ſhew how a ſmall thing ill mingled doth corrupt the whole, he ſayd,
that the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was ſubverted. For as he who clips a litle of the
ſtamp from the kings mony, makes the whole piece of no value: ſo
whoſoever takes away the leaſt particle of ſound Faith, is wholy
corrupted.</q> But enough of this. You do but cavill, and yourſelf know you
doe ſo, in ſaying to Ch: Ma: that there is not one Catholique Divine, who
<hi>delivers for true Doctrine this poſition of yours thus nakedly ſet
downe, That any error against any one revealed truth destroies all divine
Faith.</hi> For you cannot be ignorant, that when this Queſtion is propounded
by Divines, it is neceſſarily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, of culpable error; otherwiſe
it could be no Queſtion. And whereas you ſay, <hi>There is not one
Catholique Divine; who delivers &amp;c.</hi> Your ſelf did reade in Ch: Ma:
S. Thomas delivering that Doctrine in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me manner (2. 2. Q. 5. à
3.) For having propounded the Queſtion; 
<q rend="margQuotes">Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he who denieth one Article of
Faith, may retaine Faith of other Articles; in his Concluſion he ſaieth: It
is impoſſible, that Faith, even informed (or Faith without Charity) remaine
in him, who doth not belieue ſome one Article of Faith, although he confess
all the reſt to be true.</q> What ſay you to this? Is not S. Thomas, one
Catholique Divine, or is he not, one, inſtar omnium? And yet he both
propoſes, and anſwers this Queſtion, ſuppoſing, not expreſſing,
that he ſpeakes of culpable errour; and afterward he ſpeaks expreſly of
Heretiques, as alſo Ch: Ma: in this very Number, expreſly ſpecifies
Proteſtants, whom you know we belieue to erre culpably, againſt many
revealed Truths. You goe forward, and ſpeak to Ch: Ma: in this manner:
<hi>They</hi> (Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Divines) <hi>all require (not yourſelf excepted)
that this truth must not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be revealed, but revealed publiquely, and (all
things conſidered) ſufficiently propounded, to the erring party, to be one
of thoſe, which God vnder pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation commands all men to
belieue.</hi> But you are more bold, than well advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in taking vpon you
to know, what all Catholique Divines hold and you are even ridiculous, in
telling Ch: Ma: what his opinion is. I beſeech you produce any one Catholique
Divine teaching, that all Divines hold <pb n="925" facs="tcp:59214:478"/>that the errour
which deſtroyes all divine Faith, muſt be revealed pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquely. Who is
ignorant, that many great Divines teach, that he were properly an Heretique,
who ſhould reject, or disbelieue a private Divine Revelation ſufficiently
knowne to be ſuch, by never ſo ſecret meanes? Do not yourſelf heere
cite Eſtius (whom you ſtile <hi>one of the most rationall and profound
Doctors of our Church</hi>) ſaying: <hi>It is impertinent to Faith, by what
meanes we belieue the prime verity. For many of the Ancients, as Adam, Abraham,
Melchiſedeck, Iob, receyved the Faith by ſpeciall Revelation?</hi> Do you
not remember, that Zacharie was puniſhed, for his ſlowness, in believing a
revelation, made privately to him, and of a particular object? You ſpeak very
confuſedly when you ſay. <hi>They</hi> (Catholique Divines) <hi>require,
that this Truth be one of thoſe which God vnder pain of Damnation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
all men to belieue.</hi> For, all Catholique Divines, agree, that it is
He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, to deny any revealed truth propoſed by the Church, though other
wiſe it be not coma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be believed; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d you do not only teach, through
your whole Book, that it is damnable, to disbelieue any Truth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
propounded as revealed by God, but you ſaie further, that whatſoever, one
is obliged, not to disbelieue, at any time, at the ſame tyme, he is oblged,
to belieue it, which latter part though it be falſe, (as I haue ſhewed
heretofore) yet it ſhewes, that you muſt affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that God <hi>vnder paine
of damnation commands all men to belieue</hi> (poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely and explicitely)
all truths ſufficiently propounded as revealed by God: ſo that this your
ſaying, is not only confuſed, but falſe, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon of Catholique
Divines, and much more in your opinyon.</p>
               <p n="45">45. You ſay <hi>Thomas Aquinas vainly ſuppoſeth
against reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that by the commiſſion of any deadly
ſinne, the Habit of Charity is quite extirpated.</hi> But againſt this
provd Pelagian conceypt of yours, I haue proved in the Introduction, that
Charity being a ſupernaturall Habit, infuſed only by the Holy Ghoſt, and
not acquired by any naturall Acts, cannot be knowne by humane experience, to be
preſent or abſent; and being a loue of God aboue all things, cannot
poſſibly conſiſt with any leaſt deadly ſinne. I deſire the Reader
to ſee of this matter S. Thomas, (2. 2. Q. 24. a 12. Corp:) where he cites S.
Aug: ſaying: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Quòd homo Deo ſibi praeſente
illuminatur, abſente autem continuò tenebratur, à quo non

               <p n="46">46. Concerning the ſecond Reaſon of S. Thomas you
ſay to C: Ma: <hi>Though you cry it vp for an Achilles, and think like the

if he durſt not come neare it, <pb n="926" facs="tcp:59214:479"/>yet in very truth,
having conſidered it well, I find it a ſerious, graue, prolix, and profound
nothing. I could answer it in a word, by telling you, that it beggs without all
proofe or colour of proofe, the main Queſtion between vs that the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of your Church is either the formall motiue, or rule, or a
neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Faith: which you know we flatly deny, and all that
is built vpon it has nothing but winde for foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="47">47. Anſwer: What Reader will not conceiue out of your

evenleaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, ſaies poſitively, that S. Thomas proves his
concluſion, firſt by a parity with Charity, which is deſtroyed by every
deadly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and then by a farther reaſon, which there he ſetts downe,
at large in the words of that holy Saint (2. 2. Q. 5. A. 3.) and is compriſed
in this Summe (Ad 2.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">A man doth belieue all the articles of
faith for one and the ſelfsame reaſon, to wit, for the prime verity
propoſed to vs in the Scripture, vnderſtood aright according to the
Doctrine of the Church: and therfore whoſoever falls from this reaſon or
motiue, is totally deprived of Faith.</q> Your pride is intollerable, in
deſpiſing the Reaſon of S. Thomas, as a ſerious, graue, prolix nothing;
and your ſaying is ridiculous, that he beggs the main Queſtion between vs,
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the infallibility of the Church. For how could he begg that Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which when he wrote, was granted, and taught, by all Divines? But you do not
vnderſtand the force of his Argument, which conſiſts in this; that if one
aſſent to one Object, for ſome motiue or Reaſon, and aſſent not to
another, for which there is the ſame motiue or reaſon, it appeares that he
Aſſents to this other, not for that motiue common to both, but for ſome
other particular Reaſon. Now, though S. Thomas ſpecifie the authority of
the Church, becauſe, de facto ſhe is the propoſer of diviue Truths, yet
his argument is the ſame, though it be applied to Scripture. And therfore the
ſame holy Doctor (1. Part. Q. 1. A. 8. Ad 2.) without mentioning the Church,
ſaieth: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Innititur ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des noſtra revelationi

(P. 344.) ſaieth expreſly: <hi>We belieue all the Articles of Chriſtian

               <pb n="927" facs="tcp:59214:479"/>
               <p n="48">48. To this a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer, which I haue confuted, you add, to
vſe your words, a larg confutation of this vaine fancy out of Eſtius, vpon
(3. ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 23. diſt. § 13. But Eſtius is ſo farre from ſaying the
Doctrine of S. Thomas, to be a vain fancy, that he ſaieth: <hi>The Queſtion
is on both ſides by the Doctours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably diſputed.</hi> Which is
ſufficient for our main Queſtion, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Doctor, the
Proteſtants cannot pretend to be a true Church, which muſt certainly, and
not only probably, haue Divine ſupernaturall Faith, which is abſolutely
neceſſary to ſaluation, neceſſitate medij. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, his laſt
express words ſhew that the Faith which remaines in an Heretique, is not
ſufficient for ſalvation, and therefore Proteſtants and all Heretiques,
even for want of neceſſary Faith cannot be ſaved. His words are: 
<q rend="margQuotes">Neque tamen propterea fatendum erit
Haereticos aut Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeos Fidem habere, ſed Fidei partem aliquam. Fides enim
ſignificat aliquod integrum, &amp; omnibus ſuis partibus completum: vt
ſit idem Fides ſimpliciter, &amp; Fides Catholica: Quae nimirum
abſolutè homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem fidelem &amp; Catholicum conſtituat. Vnde
Hereticus ſimpliciter infidelis eſſe, (Mark) &amp; Fidem amiſiſſe,
&amp; juxta Apoſtolum (1. Tim. 1.) Fidei naufragium feciſſe dicitur,
licet quaedam eâ teneat firmitate aſſenſus, &amp; promtitudine
voluntatis qua ab alijs omnia quae fidei ſunt tenentur. Neither is the
argument of S. Thomas ſufficiently confuted by Eſtius in ſaying; It is
impertinent to Faith, by what meanes we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the prime Uerity. For although
now the ordinary meanes be the Teſtimony and preaching of the Church, yet it
is certain that by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes, faith hath bene given heretofore and is given
ſtill.</q> This diſcourſe, I ſay doth not confute the Argument of S.
Thomas, being vnderſtood, as I declared, formally; that whoſoever
disbelieves any article ſufficiently propounded as a divine Truth, the ſame
man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belieue an other ſufficiently propounded to him by the ſame
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whatſoever that meanes be.</p>
               <p n="49">49. To the other argument of S. Thomas, taken from a
parity of faith, with the Habit of Charity, which is loſt by every deadly
ſinne, Eſtius doth not anſwer, and I am ſure he would haue bene farr
from ſaying, as you doe that <hi>by the commiſsion of any deadly ſinne
the habit of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is not quite extirpated. And this Argument is
ſtronger, than perhaps appeares at the firſt ſight. For, Faith hath no
less connection, and relation, to the object of Faith, than Charity to the
object of Charity. And therfore as Charity doth ſo loue God aboue all things
that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with any ſinne, whereby God is grievouſly offended,
ſo we <pb n="928" facs="tcp:59214:480"/>muſt ſay of the habit of Faith, that it is
not compatible with any error, whereby his Prime Uerity is culpably rejected:
and as it is eſſentiall to Charity, as long as it exiſts, to overcome all
temptations againſt the Loue of God; ſo Faith muſt of its owne nature,
beate downe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all errour, againſt the Divine Teſtimony, or
Revelation, that both, for will, and vnderſtanding, we may ſay: Nonne Deo
ſubjecta erit ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma mea? which entire ſubmiſſion, and ſubjection, is
evidently more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in Faith, than in Charity, againſt which ſome
ſinnes may be veniall, whereas every errour againſt any truth,
ſufficiently propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as revealed by God, is a deadly ſinne nor can be
excuſed, ob par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatem materiae.</p>
               <p n="50">50. You conclude and ſay to Ch. Ma. <hi>Your
Corollaries drawen from it</hi> (the Doctrine of S. Thomas) <hi>That every
errour againſt Faith involves oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition against Gods teſtimony, That
Proteſtants haue no Faith no certainty, and that you haue all Faith, muſt
together with it fall to the ground.</hi> Which words are either non-ſenſe,
or evidently falſe. For who ever denied (not your ſelf excepted) that every
errour againſt Faith involves an oppoſition againſt Gods teſtimony,
which is the very eſſence, of errour againſt Faith, that is, of
Hereſy?</p>
               <p n="51">51. Your (N. 50.51.52.) haue bene anſwered heretofore;
and are anſwered by this one conſideration; That your Faith is not raiſed
aboue the probable motives or Arguments of Credibility, which being evident,
your kind of Faith, muſt be evident: but our Catholique Faith, is an
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent aboue the ſaied motives, and is certaine, though not evident, as
I haue declared els where: and by this meanes your imitation of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Ch: Ma: (to proue that the pretended faith of Proteſtants im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied not
obſcurity) falls to the ground, becauſe we belieue with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
certainty, than is derived from the ſole motives of credibility: ſo that
your Faith muſt haue evidence, but cannot haue certainty: The Faith of
Proteſtants, who pretended to be aſſured, what Bookes be Canonicall, by
the private ſpirit, muſt be certaine and evident (and conſequently not
obſcure) and therefor Calvin (Lib: Inſtitut: Cap: 7. Sect: 2.) ſaieth,
that by the ſpirit men may diſcerne true Scripture, as we diſcerne 
<q rend="margQuotes">lucem à tenebris, album à nigro, ſuaue ab
amaro,</q> 
                  <hi>light from darkness, white from black, sweete from ſower:</hi>
And ſo the Faith of Catholiques only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines both certaine and obſcure,
as Chriſtian Faith ought to be.</p>
               <p n="52">52. Your (N. 53.54.55.) haue bene either anſwered
already, or els con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine meere ſayings, without any proofe. That the Jewes
before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours <pb n="929" facs="tcp:59214:480"/>tyme, conſerved the Scripture, is
no wonder, ſince at that tyme they were the true Church; and afterward, it
was not in their power to corrupt it at their pleaſure, in regard the
Apoſtles, and other conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſtian Religion, could manifeſtly
haue convinced them, as ſhameless falſaries. But what hath this to doe with
that Church, which was the vniverſall Church of Chriſt, before Luther; and
if it be fallible, and ſo could haue bene permitted to corrupt Scripture, you
can at this tyme haue no certainty of the Bible? That Luther oppoſed the
Roman Church appeares by what I ſayd heretofore: and is demonſtrated by Ch:
Ma: (Part 1. Chap: 5. N. 29.) and yourſelf (N. 73.) deſcribe the man in
ſuch manner, as makes the matter credible of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="53">53. You tell vs (N. 56.) that the <hi>Bible only is the
Religion of Proteſtants.</hi> Of this we haue ſaied enough heretofore. Now
I will only put you in minde; Firſt; that this cannot agree with your
Doctrine, that Scripture is not a materiall object of Faith, nor which men are
obliged to belieue. For if it only be the Religion and Faith of Proteſtants,
and yet be not a point or object of Faith which you are bound to belieue, it
followes, that Proteſtants haue no Religion, or Point of Faith at all.
Secondly; We haue heard you ſay (Pag: 287. N. 82.) that ſome Proteſtants
tooke for the model, or Idaea of their Reformation, not Scripture only, but
alſo the <hi>Decrees of Councells, and the Writings of the Fathers of the
first fiue Ages.</hi> Thirdly; you ſay; <hi>Whatſoever els they
(Proteſtants) belieue beſides Scripture, and the plain, irrefragable,
indubitable conſequences of it, well may they hold it as a matter of Opinion,
but as matter of Faith and Religion, neither can they with coherence to their
owne grounds belieue it themſelves, nor require the belief of it of others,
without moſt high and moſt Schiſmaticall preſumption.</hi> It is
ſtrang, that the Approbators of your Book, and other Proteſtants, did not
ſee a thing verie evident; That in theſe words, you declare Proteſtant
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Biſhops, and the Church of England, to haue bene guilty of moſt
high and moſt Schiſmaticall preſumption, for requiring the belief of the
39. Articles, ſome of which you belieue, neither to be contained in
Scripture, nor to be the plain, irrefragable, indubitable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of
it, but to be fals, and repugnant to it. So that we haue reaſon, more and
more, to be even amazed, that ſuch a Book, could at ſuch a tyme be
publiſhed.</p>
               <p n="54">54. Your [N. 57) and the reſt till your (N. 72.)
incluſiuè, haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne anſwered in different occaſions,
reſpectiuè. Vnfortunate man! Who will not compaſſionate your
diſorder of minde, and pen, when (N. 66.) <pb n="930" facs="tcp:59214:481"/>you are not
aſhamed to ſay of Catholiques? <hi>It is too too apparent, that your Church
hath got and ſtill maintaines her authority over mens conſciences, by
counterfeiting falſe ſtories, by obtruding on the world ſuppoſititious
writings, by corrupting the monuments of former times, and defacing out of them
all which any way makes againſt you, by warres, by perfecutions, by
Maſſacres, by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by Rebellions; in ſhort, by all manner of
carnall meanes whether violent or fraudulent.</hi> If Luther found the Roman
Church, and ſuch as were vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her, (that is all Orthodox Chriſtian
Churches) in ſuch a ſtate as you deſcribe, what a ſcandall muſt it
needs haue bene to Jewes, Turks, Pagans, and all the enemies of Chriſtian
Religion?</p>
               <p n="55">55. Whoſoever reads your (N, 73.) will find that you
abandon Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that you grant very much in favour of the Roman Church, as
will appeare by reading Ch: Ma: heere (N. 32.) and I obſerue that you
confess, with Luther, <hi>that in the Papacy are many good things, that haue
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me from them to vs;</hi> and then why do you alwaies deny, that you receiue
Scripture from vs, which is one of thoſe <hi>many good things that haue
come</hi> from vs to you, as Luther expreſſly confeſſes?</p>
               <p n="56">56. In your (N. 74.) you involue, and make things ſeeme
obſcure, which are very cleare. You cite Ch. Ma. as if he ſaied, in
generall, certainty and prudence are certaine grounds, of ſupernaturality,
which is evidently fals: it being manifeſt, that ſome naturall knowledg,
may be certaine and prudent. You ſay alſo, that Ch: Ma: <hi>makes
perſwaſion and opinion all one.</hi> And why? becauſe he ſaieth the
Faith of Proteſtants is but an human perſwaſion or opinion; as if you
ſhould haue ſaied, when you ſay, this, or, that, we make this and that
all one: or in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch a one ſtudied in Oxford or Cambridg, we make
Oxford or Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg all one. The truth is, Ch. Ma. neither intended to make
them all one, or different; it being ſufficient for his purpoſe, that the
Faith of Proteſtants, was not a certaine, divine, aſſent; call it
otherwiſe what you pleaſe. You ask; how <hi>we can aſſure you, that our
Faith is not our perſwaſion, or opinion, that our Churches doctrine is
true? Or if you grant it your perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why is it not the perſwaſion
of men, and in respect of the ſubjest of it, an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perſwaſion! You
deſire alſo to know, what ſenſe there is in pretending that our
perſwaſion is, not inregard of the object only and cauſe of it, but in
nature and eſſence of it ſupernaturall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="57">57. Anſwer; we belieue with certainty, that the
Churches doctrine is true, becauſe ſuch our belief depends vpon infallible
and certaine grounds, as hath bene ſhewed heretofore: and we are certaine
that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <pb n="931" facs="tcp:59214:481"/>Act of Faith neceſſary for ſalvation,
is ſupernaturall in eſſence, not by ſenſible experience, and naturall
reaſon, on which you are ſtill har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, but by infallible principles of
Faith; becauſe the particular aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Holy Ghoſt is
vniverſally, and in all occaſions, neceſſary for vs to belieue (as I
proved in the Introduction) which demonſtrates, that the eſſence of Faith
is ſupernaturall. Your ſaying; (that <hi>if it be our perſwaſion, why
is it not the perſwaſion of men, and in reſpect of the ſubject of it,
an humane perſwaſion?</hi>) deſerves no anſwer. Is not even the
Beatificall viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in men, as in the ſubject thereof? And yet I hope you
will not call it, a meere humane Act, and much less an humane perſwaſion:
beſides our Faith being abſolutely certaine, cannot be called, only a
perſwaſion.</p>
               <p n="58">58. Your (N. 75.) containes nothing which is not
anſwered by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Grounds; and in particular by your owne Doctrine, that
every cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable error, againſt any revealed truth is damnable, yea and
repugnant to ſome fundamentall neceſſary Article; from whence it muſt
follow, that of two diſſenting in revealed Truths, he who culpably erres,
ſinnes damnably, and cannot be ſaved, without repentance. Your gloss of S.
Chryſoſtome is plainly againſt his words; ſeing he ſpeakes expreſly
of ſmall errours, which he ſaieth deſtroie all Faith; as we haue heard
the famous Proteſtant Scluſſelburg ſaying of this very place of S.
Chryſoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome; <hi>Moſt truly wrote Chrſiostome in</hi> 1. Galat. <hi>He
corrupteth, the whole Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin, who ſubverteth it in the least

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> May well begin my Anſwer to this Chapter, with
your owne words delivered in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of your anſwer to the preface of
Ch: Ma:, where you ſay: <hi>If beginnings be ominous as they ſay they are
C: Ma: hath cauſe to looke for great ſtore of vningenuous dealing from you,
the very firſt words you ſpeak of him, vz. (That the firſt foure
Paragraphs of his ſeaventh Chapter, are wholly ſpent in an vneceſſary
introduction vnto a truth, which I preſume never was, nor will be by any man
in his wits, either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied or queſtioned; and that is; That every man in
wisdome and Charity to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is to take the ſafest way to his eternall
Salvation) being a most vnjuſt and immodest imputation.</hi> For, the firſt
three Paragraphs of Ch: Ma: are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in delivering ſuch Doctrines, as
Divines eſteeme neceſſary to be knowne, and for that cauſe treate of
them at large; and I belieue if the Reader peruſe thoſe paragraphs, he will
Judge them not vnneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and (which heere is chiefly conſidered) it
is very vntrue, that they are ſpent to proue; <hi>that every man in wisdom,
and Charity to himſelf, is to take the ſafest way to his eternall
Salvation,</hi> which Ch: Ma: never affirmed, <pb n="933" facs="tcp:59214:482"/>and is in
itſelf euidently falſe: Otherwiſe every one were obliged in all
occaſions to embrace the beſt, and not be content with that which is good;
to liue according to the Evangelicall Counſells, and not judg the keeping of
the commandements to be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for ſalvation; which we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to turne all
Counſells (or things not of obligation in themſelves) to commands, and
could produce only ſcruples, perplexities, and perhaps might end in
deſpaire. What then did Ch: Ma: teach? He having (N. 3.) declared at large,
two kinds of things neceſſary to ſalvation, neceſſitate tantum
praecepti, or alſo neceſſitate medij, delivers theſe words (N. 4.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">Out of the foreſaid difference
followeth an other, that (generally ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aking) in things neceſſary, only
becauſe they are commanded, it is ſufficient for avoiding ſinne, that we
procede prudently, and by the conduct of ſome probable opinion, maturely
weighed, and approved by men of vertue, learning, and wiſdom. Neither are we
alwaies obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to follow the moſt ſtrict and ſevere, or ſecure part,
as long as the Doctrine which we imbrace, proceeds vpon ſuch reaſons, as
may warrant it to be truly probable, and prudent, though the contrary part want
not alſo probable grounds. For, in humane affaires and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
evidence and certainty cannot be alwaies expected. But when we treate not
preciſely of avoyding ſin, but moreover of procuring ſome thing without
which I cannot be ſaved; I am obliged by the Law and Order of Charity to
procure as great certainty as morally I am able; and am not to follow every
probâble opinion, or dictamen, but tutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem partem, the ſafer part,
becauſe if my probabilitie proue falc, I ſhall not probably, but certainly
come ſhort of ſalvation. Nay in ſuch caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall incurre a new
ſinne againſt the vertue of Charity to wards myſelf, which obligeth every
one not to expoſe his ſoule to the hazard of eternall perdition, when it is
in his power, with the aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods Grace, to make the matter
ſure.</q> Thus ſaied Ch: Ma: which may be confirmed out of S. Auſtine
(Lib. 1. de Baptiſmo Cap. 3.) 
<q rend="margQuotes">graviter peccaret in rebus ad ſalutem
animae pertinentibus, vel eo ſolo quod certis in certa praeponeret.</q> He
ſpeakes of Baptiſme, which the world knowes he held to be neceſſary to
ſalvation. And what ſay you now? Is this to ſay vniverſally, that every
one is obliged to take the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt way to his ſalvation? Is it not to
ſay the direct contrary, that not in all kinds of things, one is bound to
take the ſafeſt parte, as ſhall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explicated hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deſire the Reader ſo ſee what Ch: Ma: ſaieth
(N. 7.8.9.10, 11.) <pb n="934" facs="tcp:59214:483"/>and he will find you could not
anſwer ſo briefly, as (N. 3.) you pretend you could doe. For I haue proved
that by your owne confeſſion we erre not fundamentally, and you grant that
Proteſtants erre damnably (which we deny of Catholiques) therfore we are more
ſafe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, ſeing both of vs conſent, that you erre damnably, and we
abſolutely denie that we doe ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I was glad to heare you confess perforce (N. 2.) that
in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which Ch: Ma: delivers (N. 12.) <hi>there is ſomething
that has ſome probability to perſwade ſome Protestants to forſake
ſome of their opinions, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to leaue their commumion.</hi> For this is
to grant, that according to a probable, and conſequently a prudent opinion,
ſome Proteſtants, your pretended Brethren, are Heretiques, and that the
reſt, ſinne grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in not forſaking the communion of thoſe
other; which, vpon the matter, is to yeald, that all Proteſtants (vpon one of
theſe two accounts or titles] are in ſtate of damnation; and is not this to
contradict the title of your Book? <hi>The Proteſtant Religion a ſafe way
to ſalvation.</hi> But I could not but wonder, how you could induce
yourſelf, to ſay, ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, <hi>To proue Protestants in state of
ſinne while they remaine ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Roman Church there is not one
word or ſyllable</hi> (in that N. 12.) ſeing if they forſake thoſe
opinions, eo ipſo, they come to agree therein with the Roman Church; and if
they perſiſt in their errours, and for that cauſe, be forſaken by their
Brethren, theſe forſakers in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, come to agree with the Roman
Church, and divide themſelves from thoſe other Proteſtants. Beſides; if
once it be granted, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are obliged to forſake one an other,
no man to whom the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſoule is deare, will not ſpedily
returne to that Church, from which all of them departed, whatſoever you may
ſpeculate, or fancy to the contrary. As for your inſtance, that Catholiques
differ about the Doctrine of Perdetermination, or abſolute Election; it is
not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſeing all Catholiques, profess to hold them no
otherwiſe, than as they may conſiſt with freewill, which thoſe
Proteſtants of whom Ch. Ma. ſpeakes deny, and therefore his Inferences are
of force againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, not againſt Catholiques. There is no
doubt, but that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of mens opinions, may, and will, be imputed
to them, when they might ſee them, if it were not for ſome fault of their
owne, as even yourſelf grant in this place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To your N. 5. (ſo it ſhould be, but is omitted) It
is vanity in you to ſay, <hi>It was needless to proue that due order is to be
obſerued in any thing <pb n="935" facs="tcp:59214:483"/>much more in Charity,</hi>
ſeing all Divines treating of Charity propoſe this Queſtion: and in
particular S. Thomas (2.2. Q. 26. Art: 1.) asks expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, 
<q rend="margQuotes">Vtrum in charitate ſit ordo;</q> and
for proofe thereof he alledges the ſame Text (Cant: 1.) which Ch: Ma:
alledges, Ordinavit in me Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem; and yet, you with your wonted
confidence, ſay; <hi>It if stood in need of proofe, I feare this place of the
Canticles, would be no enforcing demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it.</hi> But Cornelius
à Lapide from this place, proves literally and learnedly, that in
Charity there is an order to be kept,</p>
               <p n="5">5. 2. You ſay to Ch: Ma:; <hi>The reaſon alleaged by
you, why we ought to loue one object more then an other, becauſe one thing
participates the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness more then an other, is phantasticall, and
repugnant to what you ſay pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after. For by this Rule no man
ſhould loue himſelf more then all the world; Vnless he were first vainely
perſwaded that he doth more participate the Divine Goodness then all the
world. But the true reaſon why one thing ought to be loved more then an other
is, becauſe one thing is better then another, or becauſe it is better to
vs, or becauſe God Commands vs to doe ſo, or becauſe God himſelf does
ſo, and we are to conforme our affections to the will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Anſwer: It can be nothing, but excess of pride in
you, to call the reaſon of Ch: Ma: phantaſticall, it being nothing
different from that which S. Thomas, in the place alledged, aſſignes, and
all his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators follow: and which is ſtrang, you yourſelf giue the
ſame, as we ſhall ſee inſtantly. Your errour ariſes, from ignorance,
of a double Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Charity, Phyſicall, and morall. The firſt, is taken
from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the object in itſelf; the ſecond, is conſidered
in order to the obligation, which God hath impoſed vpon vs to loue things in
that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and order, as he hath appointed: and therfore, although we cannot
loue ourſelves, more than all the world, by the Phyſicall order of which we
ſpoke, as if we did conceiue ourſelves to be of our owne nature, more
perfect than all Creatures; yet we are obliged by the morall order, or
obligation, which God hath impoſed, to prefer the ſpirituall good of our
owne ſoule, before the whole world: and ſo your objection appeares very
vaine, and muſt be anſwered by yourſelf, who giue for a reaſon,
<hi>becauſe one thing is better than an other;</hi> and I beſeech you, is
it not all one to ſay; <hi>One thing is better than an other;</hi> and one
thing participates of God more than an other? And then as I ſayd, you muſt
anſwer your owne Objection; that <hi>by this rule no man ſhould loue
himſelf more than all the world, vnles he were firſt vainely perſwaded,
that he doth more participate the Divine Goodness, then all the world.</hi> In
your other reaſon, <hi>(becauſe one thing is better <pb n="936" facs="tcp:59214:484"/>to vs, then an other)</hi> you forget that we ſpeake of Charity,
not of Hope, which reſpects a thing, as good to vs, and therefore in this
reaſon, you pass from one vertue to an other, and giue a reaſon nothing to
our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe. In your laſt reaſon <hi>(becauſe God himſelf
does ſo, and we are to conforme our affections to the will of God)</hi> you
either ſpeak non-ſenſe, or els you ſay the ſame which Ch: Ma:
ſaied, and which you were pleaſed to call a phantaſticall reaſon. For
God loves things as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or as <hi>one thing is better
then an other</hi> (which was your other reaſon, though indeed, not
diſtinct from this, which yet you pretend to be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) or as one thing
doth more participate of the Divine Goodness or perfection (which though you
call phantaſticall, yet it is the ſame with your owne firſt reaſon and
with this laſt) and therefore to <hi>conforme our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the will of
God,</hi> is no other reaſon, than that which you call phantaſticall. To
theſe abſurdities your pride brings you!</p>
               <p n="7">7. 3. You ſay; <hi>It is not true, that all Objects
which we belieue, doe equally participate the Divine Teſtimony or
Revelation.</hi> But you ought to be aſhamed to conceale the immediatly
following words of Ch: Ma: which declare the matter moſt evidently. 
<q rend="margQuotes">For (ſayth he) For Divine
Teſtimony, or Revelation, we belieue a like all things propounded for ſuch.
For it is as impoſſible for God, to ſpeak an vntruth, in a ſmall, as in
a great matter.</q> Is not this true? Is not the contrary, plaine
blaſphemy?</p>
               <p n="8">8. In your (N. 6.) you ſay 1. <hi>It is not true that we
are to wiſh or deſire to God a nature infinite, independent, immenſe: for
it is impoſsible I ſhould deſire to any perſon that which he hath
already, if I know he hath it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Anſwer; Ch: Ma: ſpeakes in the phraſe of the holy
Scripture, and ſpirituall men, who, to ſhew the ardent loue they beare to
God, and deepe complacence they take in the Perfections, and Attributes, which
they know he enjoyes, declare their affection, by wiſhing them to him; as hee
in the Panegyrick could ſay to his Emperour, etiam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens deſideraris.
Deſire in our ſoule, is like to hunger and thriſt in our body; and yet we
reade (Eccl. 24.29.) Qui edunt me, adhuc eſurient; &amp; qui bibunt me, adhuc
ſitient. S. Thomas (1.2. Q. 33. art. 2.) propoſes this Queſtion; 
<q rend="margQuotes">vtrum delectatio cauſet ſui ſitim

proves it; Quia etiam de Angelis qui perfecte Deum cognoſcunt, &amp;

the greatest Acts of Charity, of one of the greateſt Saints that ever was, I
mean S. Paul, who for his brethren deſired to be Anathema from Christ. And as
for the Text alledged by you in confirmation of your ſaying, what doth it
availe a man, if he gaine the whole world, and ſuſtaine the dammage of his
owne ſoule? It is nothing to the purpoſe: For without all Queſtion it is
not profitable for a man to do ſo but the Question is, whether it be not
Lawfull for a man to forgoe and part with his owne particular profit, to

or how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile your Contradictions. Ch: Ma: ſaied; In things
neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, no man ought in any caſe, to prefer the
ſpirituall good of others, before his owne ſoule. And is not this evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
true? Hath not God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to every man the care of his owne ſoule, and
commanded him not to damne it for all eternity? And haue we not heard you
ſaying, (N. 5.) that <hi>the true Reaſon why one thing ought to be loved
more then an other is becauſe God commands vs so do ſo</hi> No man can be
damned, or forfeit his ſalvation, except by ſinne; and I hope you will not
ſay, it is lawefull to <pb n="938" facs="tcp:59214:485"/>ſinne, which were to ſay, it
were a ſinne, and yet were no ſinne. Even in this place, to the ſaying of
Ch: Ma: <hi>It is directly against Charity to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to adventure the

<hi>this is true: But ſo this is alſo, that it is directly against the

conduce to my ſalvation, that may make the way to it more ſecure or
leſſe dangerous.</hi> I haue proved aboue, this laſt part of your
ſaying to be falſe; but for the preſent, I ſay, if to omit any thing
neceſſary to ſalvation, be againſt the vertue of Charitie to
ourſelves, it muſt be a ſinne, and therefore not to be committed in any
caſe, for any reſpect, of the temporall, or ſpirituall good of the whole
world; and ſo yourſelf contradict yourſelf, and by ſaying it is
againſt Charity, to omit any thing, that may any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to our

<q rend="margQuotes">that in things neceſſary to

is held by all Interpreters to be. Sure I am, that it can ſerue your turne,
in this ſenſe only, that S. Paul, for the good of others, did hartily,
effectually, and all things conſidered, wiſh to be deprived of ſalvation,
and ſeparated from Chriſt, and I am ſure, that this cannot be affirmed
without blaſphemy, ſeing it muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, that S. Paul, did effectually
deſire to commit a deadly ſinne, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout the committing whereof, he knew

Chriſt, and ſalvation. Divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of this Text may be ſeene in
Cornelius à Lapide. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it is ſufficient to haue

though heere you ſaie the deſire of S. Paul was <hi>one of the greateſt

(Matth 16. V. 26.) ſeing one cannot looſe his ſoule except by deadly
ſinne, and our Saviour in that Chapter doth expresly teach vs to carie our
cross, leaſt otherwiſe, we incurre eternall damnation, and I hope you will
not deny cut that we are obliged to avoide ſinne, and Hell: nor that our
Saviour perſwaded to that which was both profitable a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d beſt. Indeed your
boldness in interpreting Scripture is intollerable. I <pb n="939" facs="tcp:59214:485"/>will end this Number, with obſerving; Firſt; your little fervour

(neceſſary, or at leaſt profitable) may ſignifie, that Arcudius doubts
whether it were not eſteemed neceſſary, which never came to his thoughts.
Yea he proves expreſly and largelie that it is not neceſſary. We grant,
that it might be profitable to infants, by producing Grace in their ſoules,
but, it being not neceſſary, the Church for juſt cauſes, may think
fitt, not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it to them. Your talking of an humane Law, obliging
men to confess their ſecret ſinnes, and even ſinfull thoughts, will. I
belieue rather cauſe laughter, than any belief, that ſuch a Law could

Centurie Writers, alledged by Cha: Ma: (N. 5.) acknowledg, that in the tymes of

ſhewes that you dare not deny, but that private, or auricular Confeſſion,
was vſed, as a thing commanded, even in thoſe primitiue Ages. You know the

Emperour, that he would command it by ſome Law; but were deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
rejected with ſcorne, as if men would think themſelves obliged to obey his
Law, who had rejected the Law of God, in that matter. To all which if we add,
that you belieue not, that true Prieſts haue power to abſolue from ſinne;

from Idolatry: or, as if a Proteſtant ſhould ſay, Though you do not
commit Idolatry in adoring the Hoſt, yet being vncertaine of the Prieſts
intention to conſecrate, at leaſt you expoſe yourſelf to the danger of
it: I preſume you would not think it fairely done, if any man ſhould
interpret either this laſt ſpeach as an acknowledgment, that you do not
commit idolatry, or the former as confeſsions, that you doe erre in points
not fundamentall, that you do erre in believing the reall preſence. And
therefore you ought not ſo to haue mistaken D. Potters words, as if he had
confeſſed the errors of your Church not da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable, when he ſaies no more
but this, Though they be ſo, or, ſuppoſe or put the caſe they be ſo,
yet being errors, we that know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not profess the to be divine
truths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. Anſwer: is It poſſible that a man ſhould
ſpeak ſo correctingly, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d magiſterially as you doe in this place, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
yet be ſo palpably miſtake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as you are? you ſay Dr. Potter ſaies of
our errors, <hi>Though of themſelves they be not damnable to them which
belieue as they profess, yet for vs to profess</hi> &amp;c. (vpon which words
you ground your whole diſcourſe) and yet both you, and the Doctor,
diſclaime from theſe words <hi>(though of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves they be not
damnable)</hi> and put them among the errata of the Printer in both your Books,
to be corrected thus; though in the iſſue they be not damnable; ſo as you
obtrude to vs the fault of the Print, for the words of Dr. Potter, and will
needs haue Ch: Ma: partaker of your gross miſtake, in a point vpon which you
ſay a great part of his Book is grounded. Now, then the print being
corrected, in this manner, (though in the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue they be not damnable to
them which belieue as they profess) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, doth not (though)
ſignifie that indeed they are not damnable to them, which belieue as they
profess? And is not this the conſtant doctrine of Dr. Potter and yourſelf,
that Catholiques who in ſimplicity of hart belieue as they profess, may be
ſaved? And therefore your owne correction, and this very place of the Doctor
ſo corrected, returnes vpon yourſelf, and proves that he ſpoke not as
vpon a ſuppoſition of a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but vpon a confeſſion,
conceſſion, and poſitiue aſſertion, and that you ſhould haue
vnderſtood it ſo, though it had bene as He and you cite it (though of
themſelves they be not damnable.) And who is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, That the word
(though) joynd with a verb of the preſent tenſe implies a thing exiſtent
in truth; and if you will express only a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, you muſt vſe an
other Tenſe, and ſay, though your errors were not damnable in themſelves,
yet &amp;c:, or though your errors were ſuppoſed not to be damnable &amp;c:
and your declaring (Though they be ſo) by (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or put the caſe
they be ſo) is againſt the common ſenſe, of all <pb n="946" facs="tcp:59214:489"/>that vnderſtand Engliſh. Neither will any Catholique ſay;
though the Church erre in points not fundamentall, yet you may not ſeparate
from her: but, though the Church did erre in points not fundamentall, or
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Church did erre in ſuch points, yet you may not ſeparate
from her. For betwene the Preſent, and Preter-imperfect-tenſe, in our
caſe there is as great difference, as betwene a poſitiue Affirmation, and a
meere ſuppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which as Phioſophers ſpeak nihil ponit in eſſe.
The like I ſay of your other exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, <hi>though we do erre in believing
Chriſt really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent yet</hi> that whoſoever did ſpeak in that
manner, could not be excuſed from denying the reaſt preſence; and the
ſame is evident in your other examples, which therefore ſtill returne
againſt yourſelf. If one ſhould ſay; though Chriſtian Religion be
ſuperſtitious and fals, yet many Chriſtian men lead a morall life, would
any Chriſtian take ſuch a ſpeach, in any other ſenſe, than that
Chriſtian Religion is fals? Or if one ſhould ſay; Though Mr. Chilling
worth deny the bleſſed Trinity, the Incarnation of the Sonne of God,
originall ſinne, &amp;c: yet he pretends to be a Proteſtant, and to defend
their cauſe againſt Ch: Ma:; who would not vnderſtand that ſpeach, as
an aſſertion, and not only as a Suppoſition, that you deny the Trinity?
Or if one ſhould ſay to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; though thou be a knaue, and my enemy,
yet I will pray for the; were this a meere ſuppoſition? And heere it may
ſeeme ſome what ſtrange, that the Doctor both in the firſt and ſecond
Edition of his Book, ſhould haue <hi>(though of themſelves they be not
damnable)</hi> and you alſo in your firſt Edition (for I haue not the
ſecond, and therfore cannot examine it) ſhould haue the ſame (yea and
ground your diſcourſe againſt Ch: Ma: vpon it) and yet in the correction
of the Errata, both of you haue <hi>(in the iſſue:)</hi> neither can I
ſee any reaſon hereof, except, becauſe, that ſtrength of truth, and
coherence with ſome Principles of Proteſtants, made you ſay, that our
errours are not damnable of themſelves, and yet vpon further adviſe,
finding this confeſſion alſo, diſadvantagious, you though beſt to
turne <hi>(of themſelves)</hi> into <hi>(in the iſſue:)</hi> But the
truth is, that in theſe matters of damnable, fundamentall, not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
errours; of the infallibility of the vniverſall Church; of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of
Hereſie, and the like; Proteſtants haue no ſettled grounds, but muſt
ſay, and vnſay, as they are preſt by different, or contrary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(as hath bene noted els where) and therefore it imports litle, what you cite
out of Potter againſt vs, ſeing that can only ſhew, that he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to
contradict himſelf, as alſo other Proteſtants are. Now how full 
<pb n="947" facs="tcp:59214:489"/>the Doctor, yourſelf, and other chiefeſt
Proteſtants are in favour of vs, and our ſalvation, hath bene proved
heretofore, at large, out of their owne words.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Your (N. 30.31.32.33.34.) doe only demonſtrate,
that you vndertake to declare the Doctine of Proteſtants (about good works,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, juſtification &amp;c:) without any commiſſion from them;
which you could not but ſee, and therfore are forced (N. 33.) to ſay:
<hi>If this doctrine</hi> (about juſtification by Faith onlie) <hi>be
otherwiſe expounded then I haue here expounded, I will not vnder take the
juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it.</hi> And therefore you had no reaſon to affirme, that
<hi>C: Ma:</hi> ſpoke <hi>without ſenſe</hi> in ſaying that
<hi>according to the rigid Calviniſts, Faith is either ſo ſtrong, that
once had, it can never be lost; or ſo more then weake, and ſo much nothing,
that it can never be gotten.</hi> For ſeing, that Faith which Calviniſts
hold to be juſtifying, can never be loſt, if once it be gotten, this
Disjunctiue muſt needs be evidently true, either it cannot be gotten, or if
it be gotten, it cannot be loſt. That which you vntimely talk heere, of the
ſubject wherein God hath placed the Authority of defining matters of Faith,
hath bene anſwered alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as much as this Work can permit, without
deſcending to particular Controverſies againſt the purpoſe, and
Intention of Cha: Ma: who yet (Part: 2. Chap: 5. N. 15.16.21.) anſwers all
the particular Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of Catholiques, which Potter objects about this
matter, and ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes his ill dealing in alledging them. But this is not the
firſt tyme, that you diſſemble, what Cha: Ma: delivers in his ſecond
Part, though yet you make vſe of it, when it may ſerue your turne, which
certainlie is no juſt kind of proceding. But to returne to your defenſe of
other chiefe Proteſtants; whereas Cha: Ma: ſaied heere (N. 12. out of his
Chap: 3. N. 19.) that juſtification by Faith alone is by ſome Proteſtants
avouched to be <hi>the ſoule of the Church, the principall Origin of
ſalvation; of all other points of Doctrine the chiefeſt and
weightieſt;</hi> yet you ſay heere (N. 32.) <hi>For my part. I doe hartly
wiſh, that by publique Authority it were ſo ordered that no man ſhould
euer preach or print this Dostrine that Faith alone justifies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he
joynes theſe together with it, that vniverſall obedience is neceſſary
to ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> (if the Commandments cannot be kept, how can the
obſervation of them, or vniverſall obedience, be taught as neceſſary to
ſalvation?) <hi>And beſides that thoſe Chapters of S. Paul which intreat
of justification by Faith, without the works of the Law</hi> (mark heere how
impertinently Proteſtants apply the Authority of S. Paul againſt
juſtification by works, ſeing Mr. Chillingworth declares that he ſpeaks
of the works of <pb n="948" facs="tcp:59214:490"/>the law) <hi>were never read in the
Church, but when the</hi> 13. <hi>Chap. of the</hi> 1. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. to the
Corinth: concerning the abſolute neceſsity of Charity ſhould be to
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent miſpriſion, read together with them.</hi> So diffide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are you of
this <hi>ſoule of the Church, this principall origen of ſalvation</hi> of
Proteſtants! Your laſt lines are ſo obſcure, and confuſed, that after
conſideration by myſelf, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with others, I can drawe from them nothing,
but non-ſenſe; and for ſuch I muſt leaue them. Concerning our greater
ſafety I haue touched in the Preface to the Reader, ſome Points, taken from
your express doctrine, and words which heere I judge needles to repeete.</p>
               <p n="23">23. For Concluſion of my Book, I diſpoſed myſelf
to giue a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Anſwer to the concluſion of yours (wherein you are
not ashamed to ſay, that you are well aſſured that Ch. Ma. had in his
hands your Book twelue-months before it was publiſhed, which vpon my
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledg is muſt vntrue.) But vpon carefull examination thereof, I
finde that labour to be needless. You would make the Reader belieue that Ch:
Ma: omitted to anſwer ſome materiall points of Dr. Potters Book; and, that
you had obſerved all the Directions which were <hi>given in that litle
Treatiſe, intituled: A Direction be to obſerved by N. N. If he meane to
proceede in anſwering the Book intituled Mercy and Truth, or Charity
Maintayned by Catholiques</hi> &amp;c: But both theſe affirmations, are fully
and truly anſwered, by an abſolute deniall, that either of them is true, as
any man will judge, who ſhall conſider the Anſwer of Cha: Ma: to Dr.
Potter, and this my anſwer to you. And as for the latter in particular; How
can it be denied, that you procede in a deſtructiue way (which in that
Direction you were warned to avoide) who deny Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion to be
infallibly true? And how can Chriſtian Faith be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, if it be
only a probable Concluſion, evidently deduced from evident probable
Premiſes? And I wonder with what face you can ſay heere § <hi>And
lastly: that thefe archer of all hearts knowes, that you had no other end in
writing this Book, but to confirm the truth of the divine and infallible
Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our deareſt lord and Saviour Christ Ieſus,</hi> ſeing you
haue endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing more, through your whole Book, than to proue that
Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion is not infallible? That you haue contradicted Dr. Potter,
hath bene ſhewed heretofore in ſeverall occaſions: And the ſame, (I
meane, that you haue not obſerved thoſe Directions) might be
demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, in everie particular, if it were worth the labour; but for
that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which was, <hi>(not to contradict yourſelf)</hi> you haue
trangreſſed it ſo notoriouſly, as I ſhould never haue believed, if my
owne experience <pb n="949" facs="tcp:59214:490"/>had not convinced me thereof; which made
it, as hard to giue an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your Book, as it is to make on coate
fitting the moone in all its changes (which is your owne ſimilitude) which I
confess was one of the greateſt difficultyes in anſwering; to find you ſo
various, obſcure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and contradicting yourſelf (accordingly as you
were preſt with different Arguments) that I could not but often ſay with
much Truth.</p>
